Hi there, I’m a placement year student on the course programme. This year I was selected to do the double degree exchange with university in New York City, Russia. The opportunity was incredible, however as you can imagine, this term has been a little hectic. It took me weeks to find a flight home as they were being cancelled on me constantly, I ended up having to fly for 50 hours through Chicago which not only added to my stress, but made my jetlag even worse. It took a couple weeks after coming home to get back into the swing of things, but with university work, I fell behind. At this moment I have 8 pieces of work to complete for university within the next month, all final year modules. I’m struggling to keep up with the double degree, and due to having to work with the time zone difference, group meetings and tutorials are often 34am in the morning which wipes my productivity out for the following day. I want to do the best I can for the double degree, but by doing so I risk compromising my university degree. I’m aware of the November DDth deadline for my university placement work, but with so much stress this term and trying to keep up with the demands of my placement year, I don’t believe I can meet this deadline and be proud of what I submit. I was just wondering if there was any chance of getting special circumstancesa deferred submission date? I’m feeling incredibly burnt out.

Unfortunately I have already signed a contract, I did so on the basis that I could not keep them waiting and did not want to give up the opportunity in case I don't get any other responses. I hadn't thought about the repercussions for the university's reputation, I apologise if this has a negative impact! Would it be easier to delay the paperwork on the uni's side until I've heard back from all of my applications? Regards, . Hello, I am emailling to let you know that I have secured myself an international placement starting this summer. I have been offered a job_title internship with organisation. I do intend to keep searching for another though as this position does not offer a very substantial salary. How does this work your end if I'm able to arrange a more suitable placement? Is it easy enough to change the paperwork? Are there any updates on the likelihood of university covering the Erasmus grant if it is lost through brexit? Many thanks, . Hi Robbie, That's a shame but I understand, we left it too late to arrange it last term! Would be good to meet as I'd also like to ask you about the organisation requirements for another event I'd like to run. When works best for you? I'm in the organisation anyway around 4pm today if that suits? If not, I'm fairly flexible at the moment, don't have much of a social life during the exam period!😂Just have to avoid DDth, DDth, DDth and DDth because of exams. Cheers, ."

      "raw_text": "Faces are vital in conveying emotions and allowing humans to nonverbally interact with each other (Little et al., 2011). It also allows us to distinguish other social drivers such as power, attractiveness, and personality traits, just from a glimpse (Zebrowitz, 2017). Regarding emotion, there has been an ongoing debate to see to what extent facial displays of emotion are universal. With more research coming into the light, arguments have been swayed to not support the idea of universality.<nl><nl>To ‘correctly’ recognise emotion from a facial display can be considered subjective, as one person will not perceive emotion in the same manner as another. Yet some studies have shown the ‘happy’ facial display to be the most correctly recognized facial display out of the proposed seven (Mishra et al., 2018; West et al., 2012). Difficulties come into play when there are a variety of smiles from a ‘happy’ face that can be distinguished (Frank, 2002). This comes to question on the universality of emotions in faces. <nl>This leads on to explain the theoretical models that have been proposed to refute the universality theory of emotions in facial displays. The behavioural ecology view of facial displays (BECV) is one theory from an array of theoretical models which takes the stance against the universality thesis (Crivelli &amp; Fridlund, 2018). It claims that the emotions we express through our faces are a ‘social tool’, meaning that we use our face to nonverbally interact and elicit reactions from humans. The theory had also recognised that facial displays of emotion will vary across different environments, this notion was supported by Crivelli’s own study in the Trobriand Island, where he had found low levels of correct recognition on all five of the facial displays by the Trobrianders (Crivelli et al., 2017).<nl><nl>Further research that supports the BECV has often looked at how facial recognition of emotion differs between culture; the significance of Ekman’s work in cross-cultural studies tends to be cited around this topic. However, with more research around emotion becoming apparent, new studies tend to have a different perspective on Ekman’s study. For instance, in one of his studies, he had reported that the Fore Tribe tended to select the 'surprised' photograph 67% of the time when a story about ‘someone feeling fearful’ was told (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1971). Dailey et al (2010) had found the same result in his study but brought a different angle to the table. He had used Japanese and American participants rather than a small-scale indigenous society; the Japanese participants tended to sway more towards the surprised face when it was a fear face being presented on the screen.<nl><nl>Dailey et al’s (2010) main conclusion on this result was it initially came down to cultural differences, as the Japanese and the Fore tribe have different social contexts compared to the westerners. But specifically, he went to mention in his discussion that Japanese people tend to not fear strangers as much as Americans do (Matsumoto, 1988). In this case, Japanese people would not view the fear facial expression as occasionally in their daily life as Americans, this would therefore explain why they did not correctly identify a ‘fear’ facial display in the tasks when it was presented. Hence, it can be argued that social contexts will affect one’s perceptions of recognising facial displays of emotions.<nl><nl>Nevertheless, studies like the ones mentioned above tend to use facial displays that exaggerate the emotion however, in real life emotions tend to not be expressed in such a ‘cartoon-like’ way, instead, they are more subtle and sometimes even morphed with other emotions. With this being said evidence still shows that there are cultural differences in identifying subtle facial expressions. In a recent study by Zhang et al (2014), they had found that Americans were better at judging subtle negative emotions (angry and sad) than Chinese participants. It is said that this occurs because it is common for Chinese people to express their negative emotions more outwardly, as subtle negative facial expressions might hinder their interpersonal harmony in their society (Matsumoto 1989; Matsumoto and Ekman 1989; Matsumoto et al., 2008). So, subtle negative emotions such as ‘anger’ and ‘sad’ would not be recognised in facial expressions. In essence, this still supports the fact that there are cultural differences regardless of facial expressions being presented in a more subtle or overemphasised manner.  <nl><nl>The studies above clearly emphasize the fact that facial recognition of emotions cannot be universal, as there are significant differences when both cultures were identifying emotions from faces; this comes down to differences in cultural context as they vary in \"social ideologies and practices of the cultural groups\" (Jack et al., 2012). This comes in line to support the BECV theory, as both studies highlight that context is important and impacts a person in identifying emotions from facial expressions.<nl><nl>The cross-cultural studies mentioned above might have some limitations, for example, they tend to only follow an etic approach as researchers will usually be outside of the culture they are studying, which might mean valuable detail in communication could be lost in translation sometimes (Buil et al., 2012). Accordingly, converging neurological studies helps in the understanding of how the brain affects behaviour regardless of social context; so, research in this area would not be impacted by an etic or emic approach, which would help in further understanding why facial recognition of emotion is not universal. <nl><nl>In opposition to the BECV theory, Ekman had proposed an outdated ‘Basic emotions theory’ (BET) which followed a more Darwinian approach. It emphasised that facial expressions of emotion are a biological process and is hardwired, with seven basic emotions that humans can express and identify from (Ekman and Friesen, 1969); therefore, it can show a universal pattern in recognising facial displays of emotion regardless of social context. <nl><nl>The field of neuropsychology has challenged the BET by stating that facial recognition of emotion is not as hardwired and biological as it seems. In regard to the Haxby et model (2000), it has stated that facial perception occurs in the core system (superior temporal sulcus) and then further expands into the extended system in where the amygdala will be able to process emotion from faces. This model is supported by Foley et al’s study (2012) as it found an increase in activity levels of the bilateral STS and the amygdala when perceiving emotions from facial expressions. <nl><nl>The universality thesis comes to be challenged when impairments in the amygdala occur; when the amygdala is impaired there are significant differences that are seen in the processing of negative emotions (Whalen et al., 2013). This will be further examined by looking into individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as they display an atypical amygdala (Kliemann et al., 2012). A study that had shown this had used Ekman and Friesen’s (1976) series of facial displays in an upright and inverted manner, to witness if ASD individuals identified emotions differently (Wallace et al., 2008). They had found that people with ASD were significantly worse at identifying facial displays in both upright and inverted conditions, they had even tended to misidentify 'fear' for 'anger'. This was similarly seen in Ashwin et al’s (2006) study where ASD individuals were more impaired on emotions such as ‘fear’, ‘anger’ and ‘disgust’. This shows that impairment in the amygdala does affect how ASD individuals perceive emotion in faces. <nl><nl>Black et al (2017) had argued that behaviour studies are not able to localise where the difficulty lies in the brain of ASD individuals, so we cannot assume correlation will imply causation. Instead, neuroimaging studies will provide us with the neural specificity to locate what parts of the brain that actually cause this disruption. Hence, a review had examined a variety of neurological studies and had found an association between the amygdala in ASD people and facial emotion recognition (Harms et al., 2010).

However, if this were the case a neurotypical individual would correctly identify all emotions in a facial emotion recognition task, but Wallace et al (2008) had found that the neurotypical individuals still managed to incorrectly recognise anger as disgust 10% of the time.

      "fixed_text": "Faces are vital in conveying emotions and allowing humans to nonverbally interact with each other (Little et al., 2011). It also allows us to distinguish other social drivers such as power, attractiveness, and personality traits, just from a glimpse (Zebrowitz, 2017). Regarding emotion, there has been an ongoing debate to see to what extent facial displays of emotion are universal. With more research coming into the light, arguments have been swayed to not support the idea of universality. To ‘correctly’ recognise emotion from a facial display can be considered subjective, as one person will not perceive emotion in the same manner as another. Yet some studies have shown the ‘happy’ facial display to be the most correctly recognized facial display out of the proposed seven (Mishra et al., 2018; West et al., 2012). Difficulties come into play when there are a variety of smiles from a ‘happy’ face that can be distinguished (Frank, 2002). This comes to question on the universality of emotions in faces. This leads on to explain the theoretical models that have been proposed to refute the universality theory of emotions in facial displays. The behavioural ecology view of facial displays (BECV) is one theory from an array of theoretical models which takes the stance against the universality thesis (Crivelli and Fridlund, 2018). It claims that the emotions we express through our faces are a ‘social tool’, meaning that we use our face to nonverbally interact and elicit reactions from humans. The theory had also recognised that facial displays of emotion will vary across different environments, this notion was supported by Crivelli’s own study in the Trobriand Island, where he had found low levels of correct recognition on all five of the facial displays by the Trobrianders (Crivelli et al., 2017). Further research that supports the BECV has often looked at how facial recognition of emotion differs between culture; the significance of Ekman’s work in cross-cultural studies tends to be cited around this topic. However, with more research around emotion becoming apparent, new studies tend to have a different perspective on Ekman’s study. For instance, in one of his studies, he had reported that the Fore Tribe tended to select the 'surprised' photograph 67% of the time when a story about ‘someone feeling fearful’ was told (Ekman and Friesen, 1971). Dailey et al (2010) had found the same result in his study but brought a different angle to the table. He had used Japanese and American participants rather than a small-scale indigenous society; the Japanese participants tended to sway more towards the surprised face when it was a fear face being presented on the screen. Dailey et al’s (2010) main conclusion on this result was it initially came down to cultural differences, as the Japanese and the Fore tribe have different social contexts compared to the westerners. But specifically, he went to mention in his discussion that Japanese people tend to not fear strangers as much as Americans do (Matsumoto, 1988). In this case, Japanese people would not view the fear facial expression as occasionally in their daily life as Americans, this would therefore explain why they did not correctly identify a ‘fear’ facial display in the tasks when it was presented. Hence, it can be argued that social contexts will affect one’s perceptions of recognising facial displays of emotions. Nevertheless, studies like the ones mentioned above tend to use facial displays that exaggerate the emotion however, in real life emotions tend to not be expressed in such a ‘cartoon-like’ way, instead, they are more subtle and sometimes even morphed with other emotions. With this being said evidence still shows that there are cultural differences in identifying subtle facial expressions. In a recent study by Zhang et al (2014), they had found that Americans were better at judging subtle negative emotions (angry and sad) than Chinese participants. It is said that this occurs because it is common for Chinese people to express their negative emotions more outwardly, as subtle negative facial expressions might hinder their interpersonal harmony in their society (Matsumoto 1989; Matsumoto and Ekman 1989; Matsumoto et al., 2008). So, subtle negative emotions such as ‘anger’ and ‘sad’ would not be recognised in facial expressions. In essence, this still supports the fact that there are cultural differences regardless of facial expressions being presented in a more subtle or overemphasised manner. The studies above clearly emphasize the fact that facial recognition of emotions cannot be universal, as there are significant differences when both cultures were identifying emotions from faces; this comes down to differences in cultural context as they vary in \"social ideologies and practices of the cultural groups\" (Jack et al., 2012). This comes in line to support the BECV theory, as both studies highlight that context is important and impacts a person in identifying emotions from facial expressions. The cross-cultural studies mentioned above might have some limitations, for example, they tend to only follow an etic approach as researchers will usually be outside of the culture they are studying, which might mean valuable detail in communication could be lost in translation sometimes (Buil et al., 2012). Accordingly, converging neurological studies helps in the understanding of how the brain affects behaviour regardless of social context; so, research in this area would not be impacted by an etic or emic approach, which would help in further understanding why facial recognition of emotion is not universal. In opposition to the BECV theory, Ekman had proposed an outdated ‘Basic emotions theory’ (BET) which followed a more Darwinian approach. It emphasised that facial expressions of emotion are a biological process and is hardwired, with seven basic emotions that humans can express and identify from (Ekman and Friesen, 1969); therefore, it can show a universal pattern in recognising facial displays of emotion regardless of social context. The field of neuropsychology has challenged the BET by stating that facial recognition of emotion is not as hardwired and biological as it seems. In regard to the Haxby et model (2000), it has stated that facial perception occurs in the core system (superior temporal sulcus) and then further expands into the extended system in where the amygdala will be able to process emotion from faces. This model is supported by Foley et al’s study (2012) as it found an increase in activity levels of the bilateral STS and the amygdala when perceiving emotions from facial expressions. The universality thesis comes to be challenged when impairments in the amygdala occur; when the amygdala is impaired there are significant differences that are seen in the processing of negative emotions (Whalen et al., 2013). This will be further examined by looking into individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as they display an atypical amygdala (Kliemann et al., 2012). A study that had shown this had used Ekman and Friesen’s (1976) series of facial displays in an upright and inverted manner, to witness if ASD individuals identified emotions differently (Wallace et al., 2008). They had found that people with ASD were significantly worse at identifying facial displays in both upright and inverted conditions, they had even tended to misidentify 'fear' for 'anger'. This was similarly seen in Ashwin et al’s (2006) study where ASD individuals were more impaired on emotions such as ‘fear’, ‘anger’ and ‘disgust’. This shows that impairment in the amygdala does affect how ASD individuals perceive emotion in faces. Black et al (2017) had argued that behaviour studies are not able to localise where the difficulty lies in the brain of ASD individuals, so we cannot assume correlation will imply causation. Instead, neuroimaging studies will provide us with the neural specificity to locate what parts of the brain that actually cause this disruption. Hence, a review had examined a variety of neurological studies and had found an association between the amygdala in ASD people and facial emotion recognition (Harms et al., 2010). A supporting study had used a functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that ASD adults had a greater right amygdala activation when viewing facial displays, than neurotypical adults (Monk et al., 2010). In addition, this evidence can expand to further diagnosis’ such as people with encephalitis, who also have severe amygdala damage; they tend to show the same recognition as ASD individuals with identifying fear and disgust (Sprengelmeyer, 1998). This has been further highlighted in Broks et al (1998) study, where the individuals had difficulties identifying fear in a facial emotion recognition task. This conveys that regardless of what diagnosis or condition a person is suffering from, the damage to the amygdala will impact one’s perception of emotion in faces. The evidence that is provided above clearly goes against the BET, as ASD and encephalitis individuals were not able to correctly identify negative faces (Broks et al.,1998; Ashwin et al., 2006), meaning that it is not a biological process as Ekman had stated. But despite this, it can still be argued that if ASD individuals did have an intact amygdala, they would correctly identify emotion from faces. However, if this were the case a neurotypical individual would correctly identify all emotions in a facial emotion recognition task, but Wallace et al (2008) had found that the neurotypical individuals still managed to incorrectly recognise anger as disgust 10% of the time. This further complicates the BET, as it shows to not be as hardwired as it mentions. To conclude the two opposing theories of facial recognition of emotion have two different fields of research. A large body of evidence in cultural differences has come to show that the BECV theory has been an appropriate theoretical model to explain why facial recognition is not universal, additionally, evidence in the field of neuropsychology challenges the BET model. The converging evidence in these two fields has still come to show that the universality thesis can be refuted."

I was also hoping you would be able to explain the spatio-temporal paramaters associated to speech has become imprecise as I find it confusing and the reading hadn’t helped also. Thank you, . Hi Lizette, Unfortunately I have only received one participant yet and need 39 more. I have added multiple more time slots for the coming week on system and was wondering if we are able to get friends to possibly do the experiment too if I am not able to get enough numbers. The experiment went well on ppt and zoom, however, on Qualtrics I am receiving responses for the PIS but have not got any more sign ups for my study I was wondering why this was? My one participant said he was able to sign up to a timeslot and Qualtrics and everything was fine for him just wondering what the problem is for the others? Kind regards, ."

      "raw_text": "This essay will look to answer the question above, ‘To what extent does sport foster and reproduce a hyper-consumerist culture?’. Hyper-consumerism refers to ‘the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods, exerted by modern capitalist society, as those goods shape one’s identity’ (Wikipedia, 2020), in simpler forms, ‘a consumerism for the sake of consuming’ (Lunning, F., 2014). There are a number of ways that the theory of hyper-consumerism can be applied to the subject of sport and sports relation to hyper-consumerism. However, there are a number of ways that sport can be considered as not fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism and instead an area affected by hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>There are a number of highly popular professional sports that over the last 3 decades have seen the change of consumerism within the professional sport. Hyper-consumerism in a number of professional sports. One professional sport where there has been an abundance of growth in consumerism and profitability is professional football. The Premier League teams of England are projected to pull in £5.4bn in the 202021 season (Deloitte, 2020). With £1.35bn (25%) of this coming from commercial business for the Premier League clubs. The Premier League generates the most revenue out of all the top 5 European football leagues by roughly £1.5bn over the closest league, Spain at £3.38bn. The scale of these figures show the high expenditure within football leagues but especially the Premier League. It also shows the size of the commercial brands of the Premier League teams. Specifically the annual revenue of the big 6 Premier League teams totalling £4.13bn (Sports Pro Media, 2020). This revenue causes high expenditure on transfers and wages for players. This lavish spending fosters a lifestyle that is presented to fans and these fans want to be a part of whether its buying a jersey of the team they support or buying a season ticket to watch their team every weekend. These actions are a perfect example of hyper-consumerism culture with these goods being non-functional and possess a significant pressure in the supporters life and take control of their lives when the games are being played. <nl><nl>Although hyper-consumerism does play a role within sports, as presented above, however, is the growth of revenues within football fostered by hyper-consumerism not the other way round? Hyper-consumerism is a theory that has been around longer than the growth in revenues for sports with its close association with globalisation and cultural homogenisation (McGregor, S., 2007). With this considered if there was a lack of globalisation and cultural homogenisation would we see the high revenue of the top global sporting leagues such as  the NFL, NBA, MLB and the Premier League, which all are valued between £5bn and £11bn (AP Sports Editor, 2020). Without the human nature of greed that causes hyper-consumerism would we instead see these leagues having significantly lower revenue. This is just one factor that could suggest in my opinion that hyper-consumerism fosters sports and the growth of sports. It can also be considered that hyper-consumerism and sports are actually symbiotic, in which they work in a close relationship as one grows the other grows and vice-versa. <nl> <nl>Another factor that supports the idea of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism is that of the growing expenditure of households on sports. According to a study by Sheffield Hallam University, the average household expenditure on sports in 2002 was £11.38, however, as of 2018 the average household expenditure on sports was £76.80 (Gov.uk, 2019).  This is a 674% increase in expenditure over 16 years or 42% per year. This tremendous growth in expenditure is similar to the growth in revenue of the most popular UK sporting league, the Premier League, which over 16 years saw its revenues grow from £1.25bn (Deloitte, 2003) to £5.4bn, a growth of 432% or 27% . This shows as a professional sport league grows so does the expenditure by a household. Thus showing evidence of how sport can reproduce and foster a hyper-consumerism culture which is clearly evident in the UK. This culture has significantly grown in the UK over the last two decades and I will look at further into this essay. <nl><nl>Although there is evidence of hyper-consumerism having a relationship to sport, there is also evidence of hyper-consumerism being caused by the growth of technology. A prime example of this is the hyper-consumerism of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has seen a growth of hyper-consumerism with the growth of technology within the country’s economy (Kazim, A., 2018). With an abundance of mega malls and the growth of internet shopping the culture in UAE over the last 50 years has transferred from traditional markets to a hyper-consumer culture of luxury global brands. The growth in this culture in the UAE is seen further with the growth of the country’s GDP per capita which, as of 2019, totaled $69,900 (Societe Generale, 2019). This is a stark contrast to 1975 when the GDP per capita was at $26,847 (World Bank, 2019). These statistics suggest a substantial growth in the economy which has come with a growth in consumerism. This suggests the theory that the main cause of hyper-consumerism is the growth of an economy. Further evidence of this is the lack of sport participation in the UAE this hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. Reinforcing that instead of the sports being played fostering hyper-consumerism instead its the growth of globalisation and technology fostering hyper-consumerism. Ultimately, this shows that hyper-consumerism can exist without a large presence of sport within the economy. <nl><nl>This hyper-consumerist culture that has been seen in the United Arab Emirates is prominently the whole world over. However, there is clear and specific sport  that can be given as evidence for fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. One such sport is basketball and specifically the NBA (National Basketball Association). A prime example within the sport is the Air Jordan brand, owned by Nike and named after the critically acclaimed greatest player of all time, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan brand, launched in 1984, in 2019, had revenues totalling $3.1 billion which made up 8% of Nike’s revenues in the same year (Forbes, 2020). This along with the revenue of the NBA itself of $8.4 billion shows the massively consumer nature of the NBA in the US (ESPN, 2020). Within the NBA the most popular consumer good is team jerseys, the average price of these is $110, approx. £81 (The Street, 2020). This high priced consumer good along with the cost of attending an NBA game of roughly $89. This fits perfectly the nature of goods that are typical of a hyper-consumerist culture described in the introduction. These goods are not something that is functional but people want and purchase for their lives to fit in with the culture. <nl><nl>Hyper-consumerism is caused by a number of economic factors and the sports economic growth is instead down to the existence of hyper-consumerism. An economic factor is globalisation, with the growing number of accessible non-functional goods hyper-consumerism has become a causal byproduct. This can be seen in sports as seen above with the English Premier League growing to revenues of £5.4bn in 2020. With the league being watched globally in 188 of 193 countries (Premier League, 2019). Without globalisation there would not be abundant accessibility of sports to consumers. With the growth of commercial sports media on the internet in places such as Youtube, with 79% of users watching sports on the platform (Youtube, 2020). Globalisation of markets has caused  hyper-consumerism and greater accessibility to sports that would not be possible without globalisation. . <nl><nl>Previously I have discussed the growing sporting culture and spectator sports in the UK and its role in fostering hyperconsumerism. This is an area that has seen significant growth and can be used as evidence. On the subject of spectator sports, on average in the UK expenditure by spectators is £54 per person (not including ticket price) (Sports England, 2019). This shows sports fostering hyper-consumerism as when attending these events spectators are spending money for non-functional purposes. Furthermore, the UK sporting goods market is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Ibis World, 2020) . Largely caused by the increase of people exercising during the national lockdowns ordered by the UK Government. This being reinforced by the statistics, from Sport England, that 63% of people saying that they exercise over 3 days a week in the first National Lockdown. This shows that even in a time of economic negativity with the UK economy shrinking by 3.4% (PWC, 2020) there was still significant consumer spending on sport showing the level of consumers wants and needs to spend on the non-functional goods or services. This growth in the market even in the pandemic is far greater than other non-functional goods in this time and show the nature of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>Throughout this essay I have compared aspects in which that sport both does foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism but also doesn’t. The aspects that sport shows to foster and reproduce is through the growth of popular leagues such as the English Premier League and these top leagues promoting a lifestyle, the growing of UK household expenditure on watching professional sports, sporting good brands promoted through professional sports such as the NBA and the Air Jordan brand, expenditure on attending spectator sports and purchases at these events. All these aspects promote a clear message that sports play a role in hyper-consumerism at the bare minimum. Whether sport ‘fosters and reproduces’ hyper-consumerism is highly contestable. Shown by the evidence presented hyper-consumerism can exist and grow without an overarching presence of sport, as seen with the UAE in which the average GDP per capita has grown from $26,847 in 1975 to $69,900 in 2019. This staggering growth in GDP per capita has caused a growth in the consumerist culture which is highly focused on luxury consumer brands. This hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. In conclusion, I think that, firstly, sport can foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism. However, I believe that hyper-consumerism does not need sports to grow as shown with the case of the United Arab Emirates, although this is a rarity and to fully determine how common of an occurrence this can be further research needs to be done. Finally, although sport does foster hyper-consumerism it is only possible with globalisation and instead globalisation is the major foster and reproducer of hyper-consumerism and sports is an area that is consumed by the hyper-consumerist culture we have.

      "raw_text": "Assess the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office.<nl>Unlike many American presidents, the significance of his time in office; his character, values, convictions, and affinities combined with the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the period of his presidency, made his term of significant importance to historians and not his personality and they all agree he had a huge input in the tensions leading up to the Civil War, but historians continue to debate whether the Civil War that occurred right after his administration was inevitable or not (Smith, 2002). This essay is divided into several parts: The first part will explain Buchanan early life, the second part was his congressional and diplomatic career, the third part covers the ‘Bleeding Kansas’ and Dred case, the fourth part will assess the North and South slavery divide and then the last part will conclude assessing the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office.<nl>Early life:<nl>James Buchanan was born to James and Elizabeth Speer Buchanan Sr., immigrants from Ireland. Buchanan was born two years into George Washington’s presidency in 1791 and born in a log cabin, unlike many log cabins births, Buchannan’s father was a successful merchant and could provide for 11 children. As the first-born eldest son, he was especially favoured and had the privilege of attending Dickenson college, in a time when very few American men went to college, putting him in a favourable platform for success and was able to then apprentice at a law office (Baker, 2004).<nl>He studied law at a time where there were only three law schools in the U.S and after being admitted to the bar in 1812, opened his law practice. Soon afterward he enlisted in the military due to a War occurring in 1812 between the U.S and the UK, Ireland, and its dependent colonies and allies in North America (Baker, 2004).<nl><nl>Congressional and diplomatic career:<nl>Buchanan used to be a lawyer until he switched to politics and was successful due to his oratory skills. Buchanan successfully ran for the U.S. Place of Representatives in 1820 and turned into an ardent ally for Andrew Jackson the seventh leader of America and even coordinated volunteer supporters for Andrew Jackson who founded the new Democratic party (Smith, 1975).<nl>Moreover, in Washington, he was close with numerous Southern Congressmen and saw some New England Congressmen as concerning revolutionaries (Baker, 2004). He was delegated to the Committee of Agriculture in his first year, and he in the end became Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary and declined nomination again to a 6th term, and momentarily got back to private life (Baker, 2004). After Jackson was reappointed in 1832, he offered Buchanan the situation of United States Ambassador to Russia. Buchanan was hesitant to leave the nation at the end of the day originally agreed. He filled in as ambassador for a year and a half, during which time he learned French, which is the lingua franca of trade during the 19th century and later went on to arrange business and oceanic settlements with the Russian Empire (Baker, 2004).<nl>Kansas bleeding:<nl>‘The Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 reopened the stipulated query over state-wide slavery (Mometrix, 2021). ‘The Act drafted these new territories to expedite transcontinental railroad, the connection would bring up tension over the legality of transcontinental slavery and tension between pro-and anti-slavery activists both seeking to pass a constitution’ (Khan Academy, 2020). The faith of Kansas located in the mid-west becoming either a freed state or a slave state has reached boiling point (Mometrix, 2021). Border ruffians helped to secure a proslavery legislature in Kansas, which drafted a proslavery constitution known as the Lecompton Constitution. <nl>Meanwhile, anti-slavery activists established an extra-legal regime of their own based in Topeka. The political and ideological disputes over the Kansas- Nebraska Act opened bloodshed for 5 year and polluted the endorsers' Pierce and Douglas Democratic candidate campaign, allowing a perfect campaign run for Buchanan’ (Khan Academy, 2020). ‘Buchanan took a conventional presidential campaigning approach: making no public appearances and very few press statements, choosing to leave his campaign to his supporters named ‘Buchaneers’; Fremont did the same whereas budding Republican Lincoln campaigned heavily’ (Cooper, 2020). Nevertheless, after coming into office, Buchanan directed Kansas to be a slave state to try put an end to bleeding Kansas’ infighting (Khan Academy, 2020).<nl>Subsequently, Buchanan was given the nickname \"doughface\" by critics because he was a staunch conservative similar to Southern politicians; whilst himself being from the North. Buchanan saw that the Democratic Party's survival depended on the continuation of the slave-driven economy of the South and learned from William R. King the political importance of enabling the' peculiar institution' to continue unchecked and both were against abolitionists’ (Balcerski, 2019). After being reluctant to overrule the Southern secession in 1860 – 1861, this nickname was popularised in the country especially in the North’ (Balcerski, 2019). Unlike Fremont who wanted to outlaw slavery, Buchanan assured Americans slavery laws now and, in the future, will be determined by states independently; this catering allowed him to gain support from both South and passive North supporters (Cooper, 2020).<nl>Moreover, Buchanan became more and more dogmatic and failed to interpret the nation’, in all of his actions, Buchanan was Pro Southern and supported the Southern side, doing the same in Kansas by supporting Kansas constitute written by Southern pro settlers and not the constitution Northern pro settlers government; shocking the Northern states and politicians and constantly called Northerner's extremists and made outlandish remarks that Northerners were supporting black rapists (Cooper, 2020). <nl><nl>Dred case:<nl>Another event we could use to assess Buchanan's performance as a president was the Dred Scott Case. Buchanan supported the supreme court ruling for the ‘1857 Dred Scott case’, where an African American man tried to sue his owners on behalf of himself, his wife, and two daughters freedom; arguing that after their owners took them to \"free\" U.S territory where slavery was illegal, that they were no longer slaves, even when they went back to states where slavery was legal (Baker, 2004). Buchanan encouraged a Northerner in the supreme court to side with the South in the ‘Dred Scott case’, which essentially nationalised slavery across states where slavery was legal or illegal (Baker, 2004).  The Supreme Court ruled that the US constitution is not a constitution made to rule over African Americans and they are not citizens with rights and dismissed the case; the decision for this comes out just days after Buchanan is inaugurated (Baker, 2004). This ruling was celebrated in the South, but infuriated the North, further marginalising and alienating the North from Buchanan and Southern leaning government institutions (WH GOV, 2006). A few days later the ‘Dred case ‘ Chief clarified his ruling stating, \"Congress had no constitutional power to deprive persons of their property rights in slaves in the territories\" (Russel, 1966).<nl><nl>Buchanan Campaign:<nl>Finally, after 40 years of public service, the democratic party agrees to throw its full weight behind the 65-year-old Buchanan. Buchanan took advantage of the fact that he had been out of the country, as an ambassador in London, and so had not been involved politically in the slavery debate, meaning he did not have any strong opposition or negative public sentiment (WH GOV, 2006). Alas after 4 centuries, James Buchanan was elected to the American presidential office as the 15th president during the years 1857 – 1861, with much significance as the first native-born Pennsylvanian to serve as president and would remain the only native-born Pennsylvanian to be elected president until Joe Biden (WH GOV, 2006).<nl>Howbeit to assumptions, the Electoral College seems to show Buchanan seemingly having won with comfort; however, the truth was far from this, although Buchanan is a North native, he won in only four of fourteen Northern states and narrowly avoided loss in his native Pennsylvania. Moreover, his election run was littered with widespread suspicions, one of the most popular rumours being that the Democratic party was able to pass the narrow winning margin with fraudulent payoffs however, this is all allegations and contented (Cooper, 2020).<nl>Furthermore, as it was a three-way race, Buchanan was able to win with less than half the popular vote mandate (Cooper, 2020). In a nation sharply divided over slavery and rising sectionalism, his base support was from the South, though Buchanan could not claim anything close to a popular mandate (Cooper, 2020). Although Buchanan sought presidential office for years, he had profound concerns over this potential responsibility, stating: \"I had hoped for the nomination in 1844, again in 1848, and even in 1852, but now I would hesitate to take it. Before many years, the abolitionists will bring war upon this land. It may come during the next presidential term\" (Cooper, 2020).<nl><nl>Foreign affairs:<nl>To extend on assessing Buchanan's presidential office term, this time on his foreign relations. Buchanan was reluctant to pursue an active foreign policy because of the sectional crisis and danger of civil war in the United States (Cooper, 2020). Virtually all of his foreign policy was focused on strengthening the U.S. presence in countries to the South. \"In 1858, he told Congress, \"It is, without doubt, our race's fate to extend across the continent of North America\" (Cooper, 2020). His foreign policy remained focused on the Caribbean, an area he had dealt with while serving under Franklin Pierce as ambassador to England; as president, he did not give up on his dreams of annexing Cuba, but these ambitions were doomed by continuing Republican resistance (Cooper, 2020).  Buchanan deployed naval forces on many occasions to intimidate Britain and to curb their presence and authority in Central America and to impose American sovereignty over Central America; after a few passive threats, the British succumbed to the pressure put on them by Buchannan (Cooper, 2020). I believe as Birkner stated that Buchanan should be credited with strengthening relations with the UK, this feat was significant as Buchanan pulled this off during a period of frosty relations after the War of 1812 (National Constitution Center, 2017).<nl>Furthermore, Buchanan was seeking to create a military protectorate in Mexico to threaten and bully Latin America however, a further potential confrontation was avoided by congressional outrage and preoccupation over mainland conflict and Congressman did not approve any funding or support for any of Buchannan’s central American military wishes (Cooper, 2020). He did however get reparations from several Central and South American states over the damage they caused to American property and though the requested Mexican transit rights were denied, he did win Nicaraguans (Cooper, 2020).<nl>North and South economic slave divide:<nl>Most in the North were willing to accept slavery where it already existed, typically occurring in states that practiced extreme forms of racial oppression but would not accept the risk that slavery would expand into new areas where slavery was illegal or not present; the normalisation of slavery would gain moral public approval and might led to legal recognition into these new areas (Seidule, 2020). A lot of Southern politicians, whether or not any practical gain was involved, would not settle to give into Northern demands and indeed craved to have their demands over slavery heard; the denial of equal rights was, on the other hand, a moral rejection and a challenge to the self-esteem of a proud and sensitive person to Northerners (Seidule, 2020).<nl>Following this, many Northerners feared that the South was seeking not only to extend slavery to the west, but also to the Northern states and many Southerners feared that the first step towards complete abolition was the restriction of slavery in such remote places as Oregon and New Mexico; but both views were wrong, and an quick thinking president capable of recognising the situation and the emotions of each parties could have significantly contributed to sectional peace, instead of leaving this different in morals to brew (Smith, 2002). Buchanan's main objective was peace, but his predilections to Southern politicians whilst neglecting fellow Northerners make his dream unlikely (Seidule, 2020).<nl>The North and South had very different moral and economic model systems adopted, the South kept an agrarian economy which was strictly ‘traditional American’, 23rds of the South livelihood was on farms and plantation sites, thought the vast majority did not own slaves, whereas the North emulated Europe’s industrial revolution and was driven by employing cheap immigrant workers (Baker, 2004). Consequently, the North's main business interest was to increase tax % on European products imports, so that the other states, including the South, would buy more of their domestic products and grow the new economic system (Baker, 2004).<nl>This a huge faultline point of tension, the North thus had much more ‘Capital’ than the South, in terms of factories and infrastructure, however, the South believed their slaves to be property as a form of ‘Capital’ and not ‘Labour’; they wanted their capital to be mobile and wanted to take their slaves (wealth) across the Americas to be able to: carry their wealth across states, expand their market to trade or sell their slaves to slaveholding states and most importantly they would have more of a political constituency for the types of economic policies that would be Pro-Southern (Quist and Birkner, 2013: (American Battlefield Trust, 2020). The Southern economy was starting to stagnant and some areas were going through recessions despite this, the Northern economy was booming (American Battlefield Trust, 2020).<nl>Furthermore, in the first year of Buchannan’s presidency, there is an economic recession due to a monopoly insurance company failing, masses of business’ file for bankrupt, the economy was left volatile and would take U.S. several years to recover (Quist and Birkner, 2013). The economy was left volatile during the 1800s, as unlike today there was no federal reserve to help stabilise the economy back then and it was unrealistic to expect the federal government in the 1800s to buy its way out of a demand shortfall (Quist and Birkner, 2013).  By the time Buchannan leaves office, the population in America was just over 30 million, growing 25% during the period between 1850-1860 because of German and Irish immigrants going to work in the industrial and economic booming North (Khan Academy, 2016).<nl>Initially, due to differing political and business model interests, the North invested in railroad and roads connecting states that are at all navigable, whilst the South did not (Quist and Birkner, 2013). There were more men per capita in the South signing up to fight, but due to the huge wave of immigration in the North, they had more men who could fight, more wealth, and more resources available by the end of Buchannan’s term, which left the North with a huge advantage to win the Civil war (Smith, 1975). It is clear to see how Buchannan’s Southern close relationship escalated the sectional rivalry between the North and South after analysing the significant events in the presidency of Buchanan and the North was always expected to yield to South requests (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Presiding the Civil war, I believe Buchanan gaslighting and giving platform and legitimacy to these Southern requests to rule over the whole country, whilst blaming regional tensions solely on Northern abolitionists (Quist and Birkner, 2013). <nl>Evidently, Buchanan was given to lead over an increasingly fractured country and could not adequately grapple with the contemporised political reality of the United States; Buchanan continuance to yield to Southern demands and pleasing his Southern citizens, but Buchanan failed to contemplate that the North would not yield to these same demands and constitutions favouring Southern interests (WH GOV, 2006). He inadequately failed to also identify the rise of sectionalism and divide in American political parties, alas leading to Republicans winning every free state in the North by 1860, shunning abolitionists in society, the Whigs party collapsed, and also fragmented Democrats in the North into two parties (Smith, 1975). This lack of interest was proven during Buchannan’s inauguration where he was asked about the rising regional tensions, he said it was \"happily, a matter of but little practical importance\" since the Supreme Court could \"speedily and finally\" settle it (Histclo, 2016).<nl>Contrastingly to assumptions, Buchanan was not for any state succession and wrote a message to Congress in 1860, stating that he believes that succession is illegal, but that the federal government should not be legally allowed to stop succession if it occurs (McNamara, 2019). This ambiguous message by an influential figure was noticeably unpopular with both sides, Southerners were displeased to find out Buchanan believed secession to be illegal and Northerners were bewildered by his belief the federal government should not stop illegal succession and for the rest of his term, Buchanan retreated to his silence on any policy (McNamara, 2019).<nl>Following this, when the states, later on, made succession documents where every state voted overwhelmingly to succeed in every Southern state (Seidule, 2020); right before Buchanan officially leaves the presidency, he said to Lincoln, ‘If you are as happy my dear Sir as entering this house as I am leaving it and returning home, you are the happiest man in the country\" (Balcerski, 2019) For this case, the single most crucial reason for the War by both parties, all classes and both North and South by a long mile was slavery, a South Carolina newspaper cautioned well before the 1860 presidential election that, \"the potential abolition of slavery was a most important issue and individuals who didn’t want to \"surrender the slavery institution\" needed to take measure to defend it (Seidule, 2020).<nl>Due to ‘Bleeding Kansas’, ‘Dred Scott’, ‘Economic Recession’ and political party sectionalism by the end of his first term in 1860, it becomes increasingly evident Buchanan was not going to be a candidate for re-election (National Constitution Center, 2020). A poll in 1948 garnered interest after polling 55 reputable historians on their subjective opinion to rank the presidential performance, in addition to several newer polls such as Siena Poll 2010 and Buchanan was consistently ranked in the bottom three; historians referred to him as weak and Finkelman suggested that his lack of interest to draft policies to unite the country, showed his lack of preparedness to tackle the forecasted war (National Constitution Center, 2020).<nl><nl>Conclusion:<nl>To conclude, I believe Buchanan did try to as a president seek to preserve harmony within the government by trying to keep the country in the past, but tensions only increased after his plan to solve sectionalism and balance sides was to keep society the same (WH GOV, 2006). This however would not be interpreted as a balance and Buchannan had already been rendered irrepressible and unresponsive to resolution by his pro-Southern behaviours (Smith, 1975).<nl>Furthermore, South Carolina seceded in 1860 after Lincoln was elected to replace Buchanan, and the Confederacy was soon formed. The American Civil War (1861-1865) began a month after Buchanan left office (Cooper, 2020). Despite ‘historians and commentators of the 21st century criticising Buchanan for not addressing slavery disputes head on or critiquing him for the several states that succeed during his presidential reign and considering him as the worst American president’ (House et al., 1990). Many scholars such as Ken Stampp and Robert Johannsen say the Buchannan’s North and South segregation calamity is Buchannan’s best moment and suggested that he approached the situation in the same way that Lincoln did, but due to environmental difficulties, there was a limit to his influence (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Buchanan seems to have been a president thrown into an already fractured country, where existing issues between the free North and the slave South escalated into non-manageable levels; there were two uncompromising regions acting as two countries with two distinct cultures leaving modern-day cultural remnants.",
      "fixed_text": "Assess the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office. Unlike many American presidents, the significance of his time in office; his character, values, convictions, and affinities combined with the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the period of his presidency, made his term of significant importance to historians and not his personality and they all agree he had a huge input in the tensions leading up to the Civil War, but historians continue to debate whether the Civil War that occurred right after his administration was inevitable or not (Smith, 2002). This essay is divided into several parts: The first part will explain Buchanan early life, the second part was his congressional and diplomatic career, the third part covers the ‘Bleeding Kansas’ and Dred case, the fourth part will assess the North and South slavery divide and then the last part will conclude assessing the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office. Early life: James Buchanan was born to James and Elizabeth Speer Buchanan Sr., immigrants from Ireland. Buchanan was born two years into George Washington’s presidency in 1791 and born in a log cabin, unlike many log cabins births, Buchannan’s father was a successful merchant and could provide for 11 children. As the first-born eldest son, he was especially favoured and had the privilege of attending Dickenson college, in a time when very few American men went to college, putting him in a favourable platform for success and was able to then apprentice at a law office (Baker, 2004). He studied law at a time where there were only three law schools in the U.S and after being admitted to the bar in 1812, opened his law practice. Soon afterward he enlisted in the military due to a War occurring in 1812 between the U.S and the UK, Ireland, and its dependent colonies and allies in North America (Baker, 2004). Congressional and diplomatic career: Buchanan used to be a lawyer until he switched to politics and was successful due to his oratory skills. Buchanan successfully ran for the U.S. Place of Representatives in 1820 and turned into an ardent ally for Andrew Jackson the seventh leader of America and even coordinated volunteer supporters for Andrew Jackson who founded the new Democratic party (Smith, 1975). Moreover, in Washington, he was close with numerous Southern Congressmen and saw some New England Congressmen as concerning revolutionaries (Baker, 2004). He was delegated to the Committee of Agriculture in his first year, and he in the end became Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary and declined nomination again to a 6th term, and momentarily got back to private life (Baker, 2004). After Jackson was reappointed in 1832, he offered Buchanan the situation of United States Ambassador to Russia. Buchanan was hesitant to leave the nation at the end of the day originally agreed. He filled in as ambassador for a year and a half, during which time he learned French, which is the lingua franca of trade during the 19th century and later went on to arrange business and oceanic settlements with the Russian Empire (Baker, 2004). Kansas bleeding: ‘The Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 reopened the stipulated query over state-wide slavery (Mometrix, 2021). ‘The Act drafted these new territories to expedite transcontinental railroad, the connection would bring up tension over the legality of transcontinental slavery and tension between pro-and anti-slavery activists both seeking to pass a constitution’ (Khan Academy, 2020). The faith of Kansas located in the mid-west becoming either a freed state or a slave state has reached boiling point (Mometrix, 2021). Border ruffians helped to secure a proslavery legislature in Kansas, which drafted a proslavery constitution known as the Lecompton Constitution. Meanwhile, anti-slavery activists established an extra-legal regime of their own based in Topeka. The political and ideological disputes over the Kansas- Nebraska Act opened bloodshed for 5 year and polluted the endorsers' Pierce and Douglas Democratic candidate campaign, allowing a perfect campaign run for Buchanan’ (Khan Academy, 2020). ‘Buchanan took a conventional presidential campaigning approach: making no public appearances and very few press statements, choosing to leave his campaign to his supporters named ‘Buchaneers’; Fremont did the same whereas budding Republican Lincoln campaigned heavily’ (Cooper, 2020). Nevertheless, after coming into office, Buchanan directed Kansas to be a slave state to try put an end to bleeding Kansas’ infighting (Khan Academy, 2020). Subsequently, Buchanan was given the nickname \"doughface\" by critics because he was a staunch conservative similar to Southern politicians; whilst himself being from the North. Buchanan saw that the Democratic Party's survival depended on the continuation of the slave-driven economy of the South and learned from William R. King the political importance of enabling the' peculiar institution' to continue unchecked and both were against abolitionists’ (Balcerski, 2019). After being reluctant to overrule the Southern secession in 1860 – 1861, this nickname was popularised in the country especially in the North’ (Balcerski, 2019). Unlike Fremont who wanted to outlaw slavery, Buchanan assured Americans slavery laws now and, in the future, will be determined by states independently; this catering allowed him to gain support from both South and passive North supporters (Cooper, 2020). Moreover, Buchanan became more and more dogmatic and failed to interpret the nation’, in all of his actions, Buchanan was Pro Southern and supported the Southern side, doing the same in Kansas by supporting Kansas constitute written by Southern pro settlers and not the constitution Northern pro settlers government; shocking the Northern states and politicians and constantly called Northerner's extremists and made outlandish remarks that Northerners were supporting black rapists (Cooper, 2020). Dred case: Another event we could use to assess Buchanan's performance as a president was the Dred Scott Case. Buchanan supported the supreme court ruling for the ‘1857 Dred Scott case’, where an African American man tried to sue his owners on behalf of himself, his wife, and two daughters freedom; arguing that after their owners took them to \"free\" U.S territory where slavery was illegal, that they were no longer slaves, even when they went back to states where slavery was legal (Baker, 2004). Buchanan encouraged a Northerner in the supreme court to side with the South in the ‘Dred Scott case’, which essentially nationalised slavery across states where slavery was legal or illegal (Baker, 2004). The Supreme Court ruled that the US constitution is not a constitution made to rule over African Americans and they are not citizens with rights and dismissed the case; the decision for this comes out just days after Buchanan is inaugurated (Baker, 2004). This ruling was celebrated in the South, but infuriated the North, further marginalising and alienating the North from Buchanan and Southern leaning government institutions (WH GOV, 2006). A few days later the ‘Dred case ‘ Chief clarified his ruling stating, \"Congress had no constitutional power to deprive persons of their property rights in slaves in the territories\" (Russel, 1966). Buchanan Campaign: Finally, after 40 years of public service, the democratic party agrees to throw its full weight behind the 65-year-old Buchanan. Buchanan took advantage of the fact that he had been out of the country, as an ambassador in London, and so had not been involved politically in the slavery debate, meaning he did not have any strong opposition or negative public sentiment (WH GOV, 2006). Alas after 4 centuries, James Buchanan was elected to the American presidential office as the 15th president during the years 1857 – 1861, with much significance as the first native-born Pennsylvanian to serve as president and would remain the only native-born Pennsylvanian to be elected president until Joe Biden (WH GOV, 2006). Howbeit to assumptions, the Electoral College seems to show Buchanan seemingly having won with comfort; however, the truth was far from this, although Buchanan is a North native, he won in only four of fourteen Northern states and narrowly avoided loss in his native Pennsylvania. Moreover, his election run was littered with widespread suspicions, one of the most popular rumours being that the Democratic party was able to pass the narrow winning margin with fraudulent payoffs however, this is all allegations and contented (Cooper, 2020). Furthermore, as it was a three-way race, Buchanan was able to win with less than half the popular vote mandate (Cooper, 2020). In a nation sharply divided over slavery and rising sectionalism, his base support was from the South, though Buchanan could not claim anything close to a popular mandate (Cooper, 2020). Although Buchanan sought presidential office for years, he had profound concerns over this potential responsibility, stating: \"I had hoped for the nomination in 1844, again in 1848, and even in 1852, but now I would hesitate to take it. Before many years, the abolitionists will bring war upon this land. It may come during the next presidential term\" (Cooper, 2020). Foreign affairs: To extend on assessing Buchanan's presidential office term, this time on his foreign relations. Buchanan was reluctant to pursue an active foreign policy because of the sectional crisis and danger of civil war in the United States (Cooper, 2020). Virtually all of his foreign policy was focused on strengthening the U.S. presence in countries to the South. \"In 1858, he told Congress, \"It is, without doubt, our race's fate to extend across the continent of North America\" (Cooper, 2020). His foreign policy remained focused on the Caribbean, an area he had dealt with while serving under Franklin Pierce as ambassador to England; as president, he did not give up on his dreams of annexing Cuba, but these ambitions were doomed by continuing Republican resistance (Cooper, 2020). Buchanan deployed naval forces on many occasions to intimidate Britain and to curb their presence and authority in Central America and to impose American sovereignty over Central America; after a few passive threats, the British succumbed to the pressure put on them by Buchannan (Cooper, 2020). I believe as Birkner stated that Buchanan should be credited with strengthening relations with the UK, this feat was significant as Buchanan pulled this off during a period of frosty relations after the War of 1812 (National Constitution Center, 2017). Furthermore, Buchanan was seeking to create a military protectorate in Mexico to threaten and bully Latin America however, a further potential confrontation was avoided by congressional outrage and preoccupation over mainland conflict and Congressman did not approve any funding or support for any of Buchannan’s central American military wishes (Cooper, 2020). He did however get reparations from several Central and South American states over the damage they caused to American property and though the requested Mexican transit rights were denied, he did win Nicaraguans (Cooper, 2020). North and South economic slave divide: Most in the North were willing to accept slavery where it already existed, typically occurring in states that practiced extreme forms of racial oppression but would not accept the risk that slavery would expand into new areas where slavery was illegal or not present; the normalisation of slavery would gain moral public approval and might led to legal recognition into these new areas (Seidule, 2020). A lot of Southern politicians, whether or not any practical gain was involved, would not settle to give into Northern demands and indeed craved to have their demands over slavery heard; the denial of equal rights was, on the other hand, a moral rejection and a challenge to the self-esteem of a proud and sensitive person to Northerners (Seidule, 2020). Following this, many Northerners feared that the South was seeking not only to extend slavery to the west, but also to the Northern states and many Southerners feared that the first step towards complete abolition was the restriction of slavery in such remote places as Oregon and New Mexico; but both views were wrong, and an quick thinking president capable of recognising the situation and the emotions of each parties could have significantly contributed to sectional peace, instead of leaving this different in morals to brew (Smith, 2002). Buchanan's main objective was peace, but his predilections to Southern politicians whilst neglecting fellow Northerners make his dream unlikely (Seidule, 2020). The North and South had very different moral and economic model systems adopted, the South kept an agrarian economy which was strictly ‘traditional American’, 23rds of the South livelihood was on farms and plantation sites, thought the vast majority did not own slaves, whereas the North emulated Europe’s industrial revolution and was driven by employing cheap immigrant workers (Baker, 2004). Consequently, the North's main business interest was to increase tax % on European products imports, so that the other states, including the South, would buy more of their domestic products and grow the new economic system (Baker, 2004). This a huge faultline point of tension, the North thus had much more ‘Capital’ than the South, in terms of factories and infrastructure, however, the South believed their slaves to be property as a form of ‘Capital’ and not ‘Labour’; they wanted their capital to be mobile and wanted to take their slaves (wealth) across the Americas to be able to: carry their wealth across states, expand their market to trade or sell their slaves to slaveholding states and most importantly they would have more of a political constituency for the types of economic policies that would be Pro-Southern (Quist and Birkner, 2013: (American Battlefield Trust, 2020). The Southern economy was starting to stagnant and some areas were going through recessions despite this, the Northern economy was booming (American Battlefield Trust, 2020). Furthermore, in the first year of Buchannan’s presidency, there is an economic recession due to a monopoly insurance company failing, masses of business’ file for bankrupt, the economy was left volatile and would take U.S. several years to recover (Quist and Birkner, 2013). The economy was left volatile during the 1800s, as unlike today there was no federal reserve to help stabilise the economy back then and it was unrealistic to expect the federal government in the 1800s to buy its way out of a demand shortfall (Quist and Birkner, 2013). By the time Buchannan leaves office, the population in America was just over 30 million, growing 25% during the period between 1850-1860 because of German and Irish immigrants going to work in the industrial and economic booming North (Khan Academy, 2016). Initially, due to differing political and business model interests, the North invested in railroad and roads connecting states that are at all navigable, whilst the South did not (Quist and Birkner, 2013). There were more men per capita in the South signing up to fight, but due to the huge wave of immigration in the North, they had more men who could fight, more wealth, and more resources available by the end of Buchannan’s term, which left the North with a huge advantage to win the Civil war (Smith, 1975). It is clear to see how Buchannan’s Southern close relationship escalated the sectional rivalry between the North and South after analysing the significant events in the presidency of Buchanan and the North was always expected to yield to South requests (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Presiding the Civil war, I believe Buchanan gaslighting and giving platform and legitimacy to these Southern requests to rule over the whole country, whilst blaming regional tensions solely on Northern abolitionists (Quist and Birkner, 2013).

Also, it would be great if the date and time of the two sessions can be negotiated, so they do not occur during my live seminars. Thank You. Hello Pollyanna, I do your ‘module’ module, and our group want to know if it is possible for you to provide us with some more past research question examples. Although, we have considered the ones included in the first week’s lecture slides, we are struggling to find inspiration for a solid research topicquestion. Please let me know if you can help. Thank You."

So I hope you can help me, please. I have also sent the same email to the subject and subject director. I hope you are doing well and hope the Covid-19 situation has not affected you too much. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well-being, I have had to move to Philadelphia from my family home in Seattle. I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. I just wanted to confirm whether my decision is okay. So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university YYYY-YYYY) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in Dallas. In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. And if I had to come onto campus to present or any other important reasons I could travel to San Fransisco for a week. There are options for me transferring universities or taking a year out however for my own self I do love going to university because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. Hopefully, for only a short period things at home in Chicago are not good and I thought I would stay in Dallas with my relatives that live here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted. At least till August and I may as well use the Covid-19 online teaching to its advantage. In terms of adapting to the changes being made at university because of Covid-19.

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>The topic of research I decided to study is why it’s mostly students who take Humanities and social sciences degrees; specifically, Psychology students, who are interested in East Asian cultures such as Korean culture. This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity.<nl><nl>My main research question is ‘What Psychology students’ experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?’ I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student’s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you’re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. &amp; Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific.<nl><nl>I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes.<nl><nl>Relatability <nl>I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren’t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they’ve been though a lot]\".

      "fixed_text": "Introduction The topic of research I decided to study is why it’s mostly students who take Humanities and social sciences degrees; specifically, Psychology students, who are interested in East Asian cultures such as Korean culture. This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity. My main research question is ‘What Psychology students’ experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?’ I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student’s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you’re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. and Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific. I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further. Analysis The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes. Relatability I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren’t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they’ve been though a lot]\". This further supports the claim that sex workers are not treated fairly and due to their nature of work and even based on just their gender, are not protected but even blamed. Faith feels that Korean culture is respectful, and group orientated, she states that \"with the whole South Korean culture like they are all like respectful to each other it’s a culturist culturistic culture so like I really enjoy that\". From this we can infer that Faith is drawn to the group orientated mindset, however, I am assuming that when she means ‘culturistic’ she meant collectivist, I did check it by her to be sure. She feels like South Korean social culture is like South African culture in terms of mutual respect for the people around you and the collectivism shown amongst people, she mentions that \"I love working together\" and \"in South Africa you know your neighbours, you know everyone, here you don’t [know your neighbours] you don’t know your flatmates\" this suggests that she can relate to Korean culture more than Western culture as they share similar cross-cultural values that she understands, thus supporting the effect of relatability on her interest in South Korean culture. Self-discovery I chose self-discovery as another theme because whilst talking to Faith, I was able to find out that she felt personal connections to some experiences she discussed and felt that they brought out or revitalised parts of her interests or personalities that were previously doormat or overshadowed. Faith stated that Psychology was her favourite subject during sixth form, and it was the only one she found interesting during A levels \"A levels was like the worst two years of my life\" this suggests that A levels was not an enjoyable time for Faith and further shows how Psychology could have been her favourite subject. She also highlights how her Psychology teacher during that time was really kind and helpful to her \"he helped me like prepare everything to do for uni\" she says now, she does not regret her decision to study Psychology at University all these things combined may have influenced the positive feelings she started to have when first learning Psychology which has led her to pursue it at a higher level. Faith finds that she is learning more about herself through Psychology even though she believes that \"Psychology involves learning about others\" this suggests that Psychology allows for the personal development of students who study it and gives a chance for them to open their minds and find out about other things that may interest them. Within the theme of self-discovery, as Faith became more interested in Korean culture, she also became interested in Korean skin care \"South Korea has the best skin care\" this just coincides with the common sentiment of Korean skincare. The country is known worldwide as the plastic surgery capital and for its dermatological research and highly popularised cosmetic culture which includes skin-care routines, this has led to the sale of high quality, mostly affordable products targeted for the skin on the global market (find research stats and qoute). Due to the increased interest in Korean culture, this has also increased accessibility to these things and many media outlets such as Korean music and media, this as a whole, is known as the ‘Hallyu wave’. Faith also expresses her interests in music and media, specifically K-pop, she expressed that she really enjoyed dancing to K-pop groups songs as she was not able to during secondary school, Korean culture \"has brought back like dancing part of me back\" this suggests that exploring the culture further has allowed her to pursue her interests again. Faith has also taken an interest in Korean food and feels like the country’s cooking practices have entered her cooking style \"like now I’m starting to cook with like Soy sauce [and all these things]\" this shows how influenced Faith has become by Korean culture and how its seamlessly interwoven into her life. She states that \"everything I do now just leads me to them\", the ‘them’ being the main interest points of Korean culture for her e.g., dance and cooking. Faith also found interest in Korean dramas and movies due to recommendations from friends but was already interested in other foreign shows \"(.) I just got bored of watching Western stuff\" this suggests Faith’s willingness to consume media and entertainment different to watch she usually consumes, indicating an open, which was one of the reasons I expressed for the connection of Psychology students and their interest in Korean culture as Psychology students usually cultivate an open mind during their degrees. Through this analysis of the themes, I have been able to conclude that there is a link between Psychology students’ experiences with interests in Korean culture whilst focusing on Faith and what her experiences are. The link is related to the benefits of open mindedness which allows you to find new interests pr develop old ones that you previously had, especially open mindedness to cultures different or similar to your own but in another societal setting."

Dear Lily, Thank you, I have done this today! When is the next payment run? Cheers, . Hey Hannah, Thanks for gets back to me, I have now received it! Cheers, . Dear Shay, I must admit I have completely put my research poster on the backburner for the past couple of months, as I finished my draft poster but had to wait for my actual draft proposal to be accepted and fed-back on before finalising my poster and editing it. I found your last email so unbelievably helpful in sparking ideas for my poster, and in turn my final year research idea, and I thought I’d send over my draft poster as it was before the feedback was given. Any thoughts are always extremely appreciated, but of course no direct feedback on the content of the research poster draft as I imagine that would break some rules! I imagine I will be in touch more in August when I come to actually conduct a study in this area. In regard to my plans for scaling the research down to something that could be achieved in an undergraduate dissertation, at the moment I fully intend to \"go bold\" and find some way of administering CBD to subjects on some scale but will definitely make some back-up plans in case this proves impossible. Thank you for sending through those risk assessment and application documents, now I am back in the Uni-work headspace I will have a crack at them! Again, thank you so much for all your support, it feels brilliant to have someone to discuss this sort of thing with! Cheers, . Ps. Good luck with maternity leave!!!"

Google maps it, looks hard to miss, it's huge. There seems to be a great restaraunt a short walk from the city centre, 'Ravintola Nokka', again, great reviews, by the water, and the food looks incredible (think traditional Helsinki but with a modern feel to it?). - Kanavaranta 7 F, 00160, Helsinki, Finland. If you're looking for a souvenier for Esmerelda, there's a traditional-type souvenier shop 'Liopro' just off Helsinki's central market square, plus it gives you a chance to give the market a look. There's also a massive 'Flying Tiger' in the city centre, it's not traditional Finland but it's brightly-coloured Copenhagen-themed stuff, probably a better bet for a young kid if I'm honest. For that night out, there's a brilliant looking rock club called 'Tavastia' nearby, live music and apparently one of Europe's oldest rock clubs? Worth a shot, if you're not a fan there's always a bar by the sea! Anyway those are the ones I found, have a look on tripadvisor and see if there's anything else you'd be up for while you're there? Have fun! Cheers, Mike",

      "raw_text": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.",

The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists. Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success. It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean. WADA cannot enforce consequences 'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country. The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’ For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to. Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. Legalising doping is flawed It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations. While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious. It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change. Conclusion It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport."

      "raw_text": "Employee relations is a socio-economic exchange between employer and employee with an agreement set regarding the latter’s labour power and capacity to work. (Blyton, Turnbull 2004) Employment relations examines and analyses the various dimensions of this employee-employer relationship. The impact of employee relations has a huge impact on the UK as there are approximately 32.6 million people (ONS, November 2020) employed in the country. <nl>Government as a body plays a central role in employment relations to meet the economic and social goals of the country. The Government, who help to shape and intervene with employment relations have continually formulated new regulations and laws which affect all parties of the employment relations. One of the roles Government has always held is economic manager, they are assigned to plan and manage national economic activities (Kaul, 1997) and deal with policies at both the macro and micro level, ensuring that the labour markets operates well. (Cowling, Mitchell 1997) The Government itself is an employer, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported in June 2019, there were 5.42 million people employed in the UK’s public sector, accounting for 16.5% of all those in paid work. <nl><nl>Gender equality is a worldwide issue, statistics show there have always been more men than women in the labor market. In 1971, 52.8% was the female employment rate in comparison to 92.1% of their counterpart. The gap has reduced drastically with figures from 2020 showing a female employment rate of 72.1% and a male employment rate of 78.4% (ONS), a reduction in difference of over 30%. Though the UK’s statistics have improved massively, the council of foreign relations ranked the country 7th on women’s economic participation around the world, ranking behind other western countries such as Australia and Canada. Though in the time since 1971, there has been massive developments in gender equality in the workplace, when comparing to the rest of the world we can see the UK has a lot of catching up to do to provide women the same economic opportunities as their male counterparts. This report will emphasize the UK Governments intervention on gender equality and the overall impact of this on the economy and employee relations. <nl>Introduction of new legislation by the UK in employment relations has been one of the interventions which has helped to improve the gender gap in the UK. The Equal Pay Act (1970) and the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) were revolutionary legislations which opened a door for women in the workplace; the two legislations helped the minority gender and stated that employers must ensure that there is no sex discrimination, direct or indirect. In 2002, Blair’s Labour party introduced the right to request flexible working which would facilitate both work and caring responsibilities for women. The change continued with different Governments and in 2010 the Labour Government introduced the Equality act which focused on ‘building a fairer Britain’ and brought together previous anti-discrimination laws, into one single legislation. When addressing gender quality on International women’s day, Boris Johnson stated that there is ‘so much more to do to ensure gender equality’ making us aware that the Government has and will continue to authorize different legislations to ensure that inequality is reduced from the workplace and instead, equality is made apparent. <nl><nl>Participation of women in the UK labour market is increasing year on year; though the labour market remains dominated by men, the difference in the gap between men and women has reduced. In the first quartile of 2010, there was a female employment rate of women aged 16-64 of 65.6%, whilst the male employment rate for the same quartile was 74.9%, a difference of 9.3%. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2020, ONS reported 72.6% of women were in work whilst 79.8% of males were employed, a difference of 7.2%. The difference in the gap in between employment rates has seen over a 2% decrease in the past decade, with 2020 reporting the lowest data recorded.  Women employment rate is at the highest it has ever been, despite the job loss consequences of the covid-19 pandemic which has seen many lose their job. A national survey named the Women and Employment survey, which interviewed 5588 women between the ages of 16-59 in the 1980’s produced key findings including evidence that though women returned to work after having children, it modified their lifetime earnings drastically with data showing that if a women was to have two children, it would reduce her lifetime earnings by roughly half than if she had remained childless. (Martin, Roberts 2006) In the past few decades, we have seen that working mothers are able to balance both their work and home life, and having a job provides them with stimulation, and better feelings of themselves (Poduval and Poduval 2009). Few reasons why there has been an increase of mothers in the workforce is due to the forming of new legislations and regulations by the Government including but not limited to the Shared Parental Leave 2014 and the lone parent income and support and Equality act 2010. These have helped women to feel better represented and led to positive effects on women employment and bringing in women into the workplace, allowing them to juggle their career and their families. Change in state pension age has also had an impact on the rise of women in employment; older women will stay in work for longer than previous years; for them it will provide ‘financial independence’ and an ‘opportunity to save for retirement’ (Thompson, 2020) <nl>The recession in 2008 saw both men and women being made redundant leading to an overall decrease in employment; women faired better in this decrease though due to their form of employment. Although numbers of full-time women in employment decreased, there was an incline of workers in part-time positions with employment rates in the public sector areas of education and health, where women are more heavily represented seeing a growth of 300,000 jobs between 2008 and 2009 (Rubery and Raggerty, 2013) During the recession, organisations used the method of labour market flexibility; markets responded to the changing economic conditions by making their full-time employees redundant whilst recruiting additional part-time workers to decrease working costs whilst having employees still produce the same levels of work; many women took advantage of the opportunity and so we didn’t see numbers of part-time female employment reduce. The Government permitted this labour market flexibility to continue to take the country’s market back to steadiness (Bell and Blenchflower, 2010). To help support people get back into work; the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) introduced the Future Jobs Fund (FJF) in 2009 hoping to create jobs for those disadvantaged. By 2012, we saw the economy start to improve again but in the four years before this, in such challenging times, the Government should have looked to create interventions and ways to support all those who had been affected by the recession.<nl>Though there is the issue of more men in work then women, gender pay gap is another key problem in gender inequality. In April 2019, the Office of National Statistics reported a gender pay gap of 17.4%, stating that in higher positions, there was a much larger difference in pay between the two genders compared to lower paid positions. When women enter the Labour market in low paid jobs, they are seen to rarely progress up, instead in a ‘sticky floor’ position, for men though, these jobs are seen as ‘springboards’ for them into higher paid positions. Government intervention in the form of legislations and policies help to reduce this dichotomy; the introduction of the flexible working act in 2014 and the Children and Family act (2014) meant that women could balance their families and responsibilities they have out of work. The flexible working act however stated that employees only have the right to request a change in working times after completing 26 weeks of employment. The Hampden Alexander review, supported by the Government set a minimum 33% target for women on the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 boards and the two divisions of leadership below this who would publish annual reports on gender pay gap too. Olsen et al (2018) found that women who do part time work tend to have higher quality jobs then men who work part time but that in the Labour market history, a driver for the pay gap, there was a 56% difference in the way men and women participate, 43.6% of this accounted for by the fact that men usually have a lot more experience in working full-time than women. According to equal pay act 2010, organisations had to publish six calculations including the mean and median gender pay gap in hourly pay every year (EHRC, 2020). In 2015, this voluntary reporting was made mandatory, however till today, this report publishing is not completely affective, in 2019, the equality human rights commission wrote to 47 organisations to make them aware formal investigations will begin due to their failure of reporting. Though the Law requires all organisations to report the gender pay gap, there is no requirement to reduce the pay gap, and though through the years we’ve seen gender pay gap slowly start to decrease, it is still very much apparent. The Civil Service itself, reported a gender pay gap of 11.1% in 2019, showing us that the issue is apparent, even in the public sector. The Government should have ensured that the policies they passed effected the sectors that they control and reduced completely the gender pay gap for those in such roles, this way other companies would have followed from a long time ago. <nl><nl>The Government has established a few interventions to help control gender inequality. The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1998 meant all workers would be paid a certain amount for the work they performed. The 2016 National Living Wage (NLW) added to this but specifically for those over 25; the introduction of both meant that women, who were traditionally always paid lower than men would be entitled to the same minimum wage. Personnel today predicted in 2015 that the introduction of the NLW would mean that 13 of female workers would receive a pay rise by the end of the decade due to the policy. Another intervention introduced was the establishment of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2007 (EHRC) which saw to protect people’s rights and ensure fairness and equality; the Government provides funding for the company and works with it when progressing human rights. EHRC has helped millions of people since it was started up but in 2016 saw devastating cuts to its funding, its 2007 budget of £70million was to be cut down to an estimated £18million in 2020. This lack of funding and decreased budget would have very negative consequences on gender inequality; EHRC would not be able to function as broadly as it did before, equality would not be monitored and maintained as efficiently as previous years.<nl>In the UK, the State has passed legislations and regulations in the hope to bring about gender equality. They have also established different bodies to help combat this. The equality act 2010, though one of the most important legislations to help bring about diversity and equality in the workplace, 10 years on, still sees significant gaps in employment of men and women. The gender pay gap which has been slowly decreasing, sees a higher pay gap between the two genders in more senior roles; discouraging women to try and climb up company ladders. Government should have stricter rules on closing the gender pay gap not only in lower paid roles but higher ones too, encouraging women to be ambitious in themselves. An introduction for a NLW for more vulnerable women such as single mothers should be introduced as they may struggle than most with the set NLW, better flexible working arrangements should also be made possible in all types of organisations, not just after a 26 weeks’ tenure. There should also be stricter repercussions on business’ which fail to report their gender pay gaps as a few not following guidelines could see knock-on effects on other organisations doing the same. Though the Government is doing much to fight gender inequality, as a lawmaker, manager of economy and an employer, it has a long way to go to completely diminish the issue.",

Use examples to explain. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning involves logical thinking, providing us with the means to determine valid arguments in one’s train of thought. Similarly, inductive reasoning is a way of increasing semantic information through generalisation, allowing us to come to conclusions about whether a statement is true or false. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that concrete or previously known knowledge affects performance on experimental tasks measuring components of ordinary language. For example, in deductive reasoning, our own beliefs effect the validity of conclusions we make because our world knowledge clouds our judgement. Wilkins, (1928) found participants’ beliefs caused conflict with the validity of syllogisms and as a result, their judgement was poorer. Beliefs effect the interpretation of premises, influencing reasoning and bringing about response bias, therefore affecting the validity of the conclusion made. Similarly, experiments on inductive reasoning show familiar content can remind a person of similar problems they solved in the past. Griggs &amp; Cox, (1982) called this the ‘Memory Cueing Hypothesis’ – individuals retrieve similar contexts or situations involving solving a similar problem from their long-term memory, reducing facilitation effects involved in reasoning. <nl><nl>Another distinction between these types of reasoning is the certainty involved in making conclusions. In inductive reasoning, there is no certainty that the conclusion made from premises are valid all the time, as validity of conclusions depends on factors such as premises given, intention of the argument or statement, as well as the amount of information available at the time. Contrastingly, deductive reasoning is not dependent on as many variables, and is much more clear-cut and direct. Deductive reasoning allows us to form completely valid conclusions all the time, due to logical systems this type of reasoning follows, such as formulisation. Therefore, the conclusion will follow from the premises with absolute certainty, unlike inductive reasoning.<nl><nl>2. Why do we find Wason’s selection task so difficult? <nl>Peter Wason’s selection task is a logic puzzle involving deductive reasoning, heavily influenced by Popper’s hypotheticodeductive method. Participants are presented with four cards and a simple rule, and are asked which cards they need to turn over to see if the rule has been broken. Performance in this task is only 15%, even if participants are asked to falsify the rule, not prove it right. Research suggests concrete content facilitates performance. Cheng &amp; Holyoak (1985) state that humans reason with context-dependent ‘pragmatic reasoning schemas’, involving knowledge about permissions, obligations and causations. These schemas function to predict and reason in unfamiliar situations. During the selection task, permission schemas are evoked along with a set of rules with familiar information in a given scenario. The corresponding schema matches information required to solve the task, and so permission schema facilitate performance, especially when concrete rather than abstract content is used. <nl><nl>Additionally, Wason’s selection task is found difficult when rules cannot be interpreted as a social contract. Cosmides, (1989) found the selection task is facilitated when involving social exchanges derived from his computational theory, specifically tasks requiring the participant to detect a ‘cheater’ trying to take the benefit without paying the cost of a contract. In the context of the selection task, the participant is detecting a ‘if P not Q’ card is exposing the cheat. Cheat detection is parallel with familiar realistic situations involving social interaction rather than ambiguous and context-free content. When a selection task uses abstract terms not involving social exchanges, participants find it harder to reason as the situation is unfamiliar and doesn’t entail benefits or losses. This highlights the importance of context in Wason’s selection task – when context is not given, performance decreases considerably.<nl><nl>3. What are the predictions of \"Subjective Expected Utility\" theory for human decision making. How have deviations been explained? <nl><nl>Subjective expected utility theory (SEU), (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 &amp; Savage, 1954) describes decision making, stating when individuals make decisions, they will act rationally by trying to maximise their expected utility. SEU aims to simplify decision making via 5 axioms (completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence and ranking), which when considered, will maximise expected utility. <nl><nl>The transitivity axiom assumes people make choices transitively – if they prefer A to B and B to C, they should prefer A to C. Tversky, (1969) identified a deviation in this axiom, called ‘intransitivity of preferences’, stating that humans are, in reality, inconsistent in their preferences of choices due to individual differences in evaluative processes and because preferences vary temporally. Tversky conducted experiments using classic transitive preference scenarios and found participants’ preference ordering was inconsistent to the transitivity axiom. Classic scenarios are not logically compatible with the rationality of human decision making, because variability and individuality of decision making in realistic situations aren’t taken into consideration.<nl><nl>The independence axiom states preference of order between two choices with equal outcomes should not be affected by one another, even when a third gamble is involved. In other words, equal outcomes should cancel each-other out. A deviation in this axiom called the ‘Allais paradox’ (Allais, 1953), states the independence axiom fails to consider feelings like disappointment, as well as the rationality involved in choosing a gamble and potentially getting nothing from it. The Allais paradox states evaluations of gambles cannot be done independently of other gambles, as the independence axiom assumes. <nl><nl>These deviations highlight the importance for a newer theory to recognise the influence of rationality, and which involves a psychologically descriptive approach, for example the ‘multi-attribute utility theory’ which is more able to explain decision making in realistic scenarios where decisions are dependent on many independent variables.<nl><nl>4. Using a specific puzzle or problem of your own choice, write out a plan (including diagram) of how to solve it using a state-action tree. <nl><nl>This problem is the ‘Chicken River Crossing Puzzle’: A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. The task is to find out how the man gets all 3 things to the other side of the river in one piece. <nl><nl>The solution to this puzzle is as follows: first, the chicken crosses the river in the boat, and the fox and corn are safe together on the other side. He goes back across, and then takes the fox across the river replacing it with the chicken, which is now on the other side. Since the chicken and corn cannot be left together, he takes the corn in his boat and switches the chicken for the corn, which he takes across and leaves it with the fox.

What is \"creativity\" and how can it be assessed?  <nl><nl>Creativity is defined as one’s ability to generate innovative ideas and solutions, and is seen as a form of intelligence.

Creativity has been conceptualised as a form of divergent thinking by Guilford, (1956), which is a style of thinking that can lead to many possible solutions to the same problem. It requires both originality and flexibility. Psychometric tests of creativity include the ‘Unusual Uses Task’ by Guilford, (1967): the participant’s task is to create alternative uses for a common object. Four dimensions are used to score answers: flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration. Participant’s demonstrate divergent thinking if they generate unusual yet valuable uses for the object. The ‘Remote Associates Test’ (RAT) was created by Mednick, (1962), who theorised that creativity involves associating nonidentical concepts which are considered dissimilar. In RATs, respondents are shown stimuli in the form of three words and are asked to identify a word to link them together, for example \"worm  shelf  end\". Here, the answer is book (book worm, book shelf, book end). Psychometric tests in assessing creativity have produced interesting results, especially the observed link between creativity and intelligence, however these methods often mix creativity and intelligence, or originality and creativity. That is, creative individuals tend to have high IQ, but not all high IQ individuals are creative, consequently decreasing the validity of psychometric tests claiming to assess creativity.",

      "raw_text": "Abstract:<nl>A prevalent association has been found between conscientiousness and favourable eating behaviour. Costa &amp; McRae (1992) define individuals high in conscientiousness as careful and self-disciplined. These characteristics are advantageous towards diet control and avoiding unhealthy eating. Another association exists between neuroticism and unfavourable eating behaviour (UEB): individuals high in neuroticism lack self-control and are vulnerable to unhealthy eating and disordered eating. This study used a questionnaire to measure the relationship between eating behaviour and personality type. Using correlational analysis, associations were found between unhealthy eating and personality traits, specifically conscientiousness being significantly negatively correlated with UEB and a predictor for UEB.<nl>Introduction:<nl>The World Health Organisation (2020) found that worldwide prevalence of obesity almost tripled between 1975 – 2016. Amongst others, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases have been linked to psychological mechanisms. Namely, personality, acting as a risk factor for unfavourable eating behaviour (UEB), such as consumption of convenience junk food and sugary foods, all playing a role in increasing likelihood of illness. Costa &amp; McRae, (1992) aimed to represent human personality via the Big-Five Model comprising neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness (OCEAN). Typically, an individual high in neuroticism exhibits emotional instability, moodiness and anxiety, placing them at high vulnerability for UEB including emotional eating and binge-eating. By contrast, an individual high in conscientiousness has good impulse control, goal-directed behaviours, restrained eating behaviours and dietary moderation. Keller &amp; Siegrist, (2015) assessed the connection between personality and UEB using the Big-Five Model and found conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on consumption of food categories indicative of an unbalanced diet, such as fatty and sugary foods, whereas high neuroticism had a significant positive indirect effect on consumption of unhealthy food groups, making conscientiousness and neuroticism likely predictors of the food choices an individual makes. Personality type may predispose individuals to developing obesity and disease; investigating this association between personality and UEB is important, and is useful in indicating vulnerable individuals to introduce preventative methods in order to reduce disease and obesity in the population.<nl><nl>The following study used items from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Hartmann et al., 2012) and the Big-Five Inventory scale (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) to create a questionnaire which measured participants’ eating behaviours and personality types. It was hypothesized personality would be associated with FFQ score, specifically neuroticism would be positively correlated with FFQ score, and conscientiousness would be negatively correlated with FFQ score and act as a predictor of UEB.<nl><nl>Methods:<nl>Participants:<nl>195 participants, male (n= 135) and female (n= 60), aged 15 – 73 years old. A chain-referral sampling technique was used: participants completed the questionnaire, then recruited further participants to complete the questionnaire. <nl><nl>Design: <nl>Correlational design measuring the relationship between FFQ score and personality, the predictor variables being OCEAN traits.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>Big Five Inventory (BFI):<nl>Measured personality traits: included 44 items grouped onto 5 subscales (OCEAN traits). Items were measured on a Likert scale 1-5 (see Appendix A for item scales). Negatively worded items were reverse coded: where participants marked their answer as 1, this was reverse coded to 5, 2 to 4, and so on. This was done to ensure reliability and validity by producing accurate responses. <nl><nl>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ):<nl>Estimated habitual consumption frequency of various food products and snacks: included 17 items and 6 subscales (4 were included in analysis: sweets and savouries, sugar sweetened-beverages, convenience food and meat). Items regarding sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption frequency were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale 0-14: 14 = ‘several times a day’, 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 =, ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’. Convenience food consumption was assessed on a 5- point Likert scale 0-7: 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 = ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’ (see Appendix B for food groups and items). <nl><nl>Procedure: <nl>A questionnaire was created using items from the BFI the FFQ, and sent to participants via an online website. Participants were reminded their data was anonymous and informed consent was obtained. Once questionnaire responses were gathered, participants were debriefed and a raw data set was retrieved. Scores were calculated from the BFI as mean score by reverse coding, totalling scores from each trait and dividing them by number of items for a given trait, giving five mean scores. FFQ scores were calculated as total score by summing values of the 4 relevant subscales, giving a total of 0-182. Scores from the questionnaire as well as demographic data were exported to jamovi (The jamovi project, 2021) for analysis. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows agreeableness had the highest mean of the OCEAN traits (M = 3.68), and neuroticism had the lowest mean (M = 3.21). Table 2 shows results of the Pearson correlation, indicating there was a significant negative association between conscientiousness and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.168, p = .019), and a significant negative association between age and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.243, p = &lt;.001). There was a positive significant association between conscientiousness and agreeableness, (r (195) = .275, p = .004), and a positive association between conscientiousness and extraversion, (r (195) = .147, p = .041). Table 3 shows results of the multiple linear regression, indicating there was an overall significant effect between FFQ score and OCEAN traits, (F (7, 187) = 2.68, p &lt; .011, R2 = .091). Examining individual personality covariates indicated that conscientiousness (t = -2.029, p = .044) was a significant predictor in the model.  <nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Conscientiousness was significantly negatively correlated with FFQ score, meaning as participants scored high on conscientiousness, they scored lower for UEB. Conscientiousness was found to be a significant predictor of FFQ score; these findings support the hypothesis and align with Costa &amp; McRae’s, (1992) findings that conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on UEB. A well-established characteristic of conscientiousness is self-control, or in a psychological context, inhibitory control, described by Dyer, (2017) as the \"ability to supress one response in favour of a goal- directed response\" and that it \"plays an important role in emotional regulation\", particularly in prefrontal and cingulate cortex brain regions. Conscientious individuals are careful with their food behaviours and less likely to make poor food choices impulsively because they have better inhibitory control than say, individuals high in neuroticism. Being goal-driven and good at adhering to diets or weight-loss goals may explain why conscientiousness was negatively associated with favourable eating behaviours, like restriction of savoury foods and snacks; perhaps conscientiousness serves as a prevention of obesity and disease. <nl><nl>Agreeableness and extraversion were significantly positively correlated with conscientiousness. Individuals high in these traits are sociable, creative and emotionally stable. It is logical characteristics of conscientiousness correlate with those of agreeableness and openness, explaining why these traits were significantly correlated with one-another. Keller and Seigrist, (2015) found agreeableness was significantly negatively associated with sweetened drinks and meat consumption, and openness was significantly positively correlated with intake of fruits and vegetables. Thus, like conscientiousness, individuals high in agreeableness and extraversion are more likely to partake in healthy eating behaviours.<nl><nl>Interestingly, neuroticism was not significant, highlighting potential issues with the questionnaire’s validity, specifically whether items claiming to measure neuroticism were actually doing so. Moreover, the Five-Factor Model is limited – OCEAN traits are broad descriptions, rather than explanations of the ‘why’ or ‘how’s’ of personality. Categorisation of OCEAN traits ignore individual differences and the complexity of human personality. Consequently, can OCEAN traits be satisfactorily used to derive causalities between personality type and eating behaviour? Bogg &amp; Roberts, (2004) defend the need for a meta-analytic approach when examining personality and eating behaviour; by collating studies from diverse areas of research, causalities found between personality type and eating behaviour are considerably more valid, increasing generalisability of relationships established.",

Personality type may predispose individuals to developing obesity and disease; investigating this association between personality and UEB is important, and is useful in indicating vulnerable individuals to introduce preventative methods in order to reduce disease and obesity in the population. The following study used items from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Hartmann et al., 2012) and the Big-Five Inventory scale (John and Srivastava, 1999) to create a questionnaire which measured participants’ eating behaviours and personality types. It was hypothesized personality would be associated with FFQ score, specifically neuroticism would be positively correlated with FFQ score, and conscientiousness would be negatively correlated with FFQ score and act as a predictor of UEB. Methods: Participants: 195 participants, male (n= 135) and female (n= 60), aged 15 – 73 years old. A chain-referral sampling technique was used: participants completed the questionnaire, then recruited further participants to complete the questionnaire. Design: Correlational design measuring the relationship between FFQ score and personality, the predictor variables being OCEAN traits. Materials: Big Five Inventory (BFI): Measured personality traits: included 44 items grouped onto 5 subscales (OCEAN traits). Items were measured on a Likert scale 1-5 (see Appendix A for item scales). Negatively worded items were reverse coded: where participants marked their answer as 1, this was reverse coded to 5, 2 to 4, and so on. This was done to ensure reliability and validity by producing accurate responses. Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ): Estimated habitual consumption frequency of various food products and snacks: included 17 items and 6 subscales (4 were included in analysis: sweets and savouries, sugar sweetened-beverages, convenience food and meat). Items regarding sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption frequency were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale 0-14: 14 = ‘several times a day’, 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 =, ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’. Convenience food consumption was assessed on a 5- point Likert scale 0-7: 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 = ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’ (see Appendix B for food groups and items). Procedure: A questionnaire was created using items from the BFI the FFQ, and sent to participants via an online website. Participants were reminded their data was anonymous and informed consent was obtained. Once questionnaire responses were gathered, participants were debriefed and a raw data set was retrieved. Scores were calculated from the BFI as mean score by reverse coding, totalling scores from each trait and dividing them by number of items for a given trait, giving five mean scores. FFQ scores were calculated as total score by summing values of the 4 relevant subscales, giving a total of 0-182. Scores from the questionnaire as well as demographic data were exported to jamovi (The jamovi project, 2021) for analysis. Results: Table 1 shows agreeableness had the highest mean of the OCEAN traits (M = 3.68), and neuroticism had the lowest mean (M = 3.21). Table 2 shows results of the Pearson correlation, indicating there was a significant negative association between conscientiousness and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.168, p = .019), and a significant negative association between age and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.243, p = <.001). There was a positive significant association between conscientiousness and agreeableness, (r (195) = .275, p = .004), and a positive association between conscientiousness and extraversion, (r (195) = .147, p = .041). Table 3 shows results of the multiple linear regression, indicating there was an overall significant effect between FFQ score and OCEAN traits, (F (7, 187) = 2.68, p < .011, R2 = .091). Examining individual personality covariates indicated that conscientiousness (t = -2.029, p = .044) was a significant predictor in the model. Discussion: Conscientiousness was significantly negatively correlated with FFQ score, meaning as participants scored high on conscientiousness, they scored lower for UEB. Conscientiousness was found to be a significant predictor of FFQ score; these findings support the hypothesis and align with Costa and McRae’s, (1992) findings that conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on UEB. A well-established characteristic of conscientiousness is self-control, or in a psychological context, inhibitory control, described by Dyer, (2017) as the \"ability to supress one response in favour of a goal- directed response\" and that it \"plays an important role in emotional regulation\", particularly in prefrontal and cingulate cortex brain regions. Conscientious individuals are careful with their food behaviours and less likely to make poor food choices impulsively because they have better inhibitory control than say, individuals high in neuroticism. Being goal-driven and good at adhering to diets or weight-loss goals may explain why conscientiousness was negatively associated with favourable eating behaviours, like restriction of savoury foods and snacks; perhaps conscientiousness serves as a prevention of obesity and disease. Agreeableness and extraversion were significantly positively correlated with conscientiousness. Individuals high in these traits are sociable, creative and emotionally stable. It is logical characteristics of conscientiousness correlate with those of agreeableness and openness, explaining why these traits were significantly correlated with one-another. Keller and Seigrist, (2015) found agreeableness was significantly negatively associated with sweetened drinks and meat consumption, and openness was significantly positively correlated with intake of fruits and vegetables. Thus, like conscientiousness, individuals high in agreeableness and extraversion are more likely to partake in healthy eating behaviours. <nl>Interestingly, neuroticism was not significant, highlighting potential issues with the questionnaire’s validity, specifically whether items claiming to measure neuroticism were actually doing so. Moreover, the Five-Factor Model is limited – OCEAN traits are broad descriptions, rather than explanations of the ‘why’ or ‘how’s’ of personality. Categorisation of OCEAN traits ignore individual differences and the complexity of human personality. Consequently, can OCEAN traits be satisfactorily used to derive causalities between personality type and eating behaviour? Bogg and Roberts, (2004) defend the need for a meta-analytic approach when examining personality and eating behaviour; by collating studies from diverse areas of research, causalities found between personality type and eating behaviour are considerably more valid, increasing generalisability of relationships established."

      "raw_text": "Alpha oscillatory activity (8-13 Hz) is the dominant EEG rhythm in the awake brain. Initially thought to reflect cortical idling (Pfurtscheller, Stancák, &amp; Neuper, 1996), the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) suggests that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task-irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch, Sauseng, &amp; Hanslmayr, 2007). Supporting this, visual spatial attention tasks found a robust cortical response: when attention was directed to one hemifield via a directional cue, alpha decreased in the contralateral hemisphere (Sauseng, et al., 2005; Thut, Nietzel, Brandt., &amp; Pascual-Leone, 2006) and increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Worden, Foxe, Wang, &amp; Simpson, 2000; Kelly, Lalor, Reilly, &amp; Foxe, 2006), suggesting alpha oscillations were supressed in brain areas involved in active processing. Thus, alpha oscillations have emerged as an indicator of sensory supression and are proposed to play a pivatol, mechanistic role in attention by gating information flow to relevant sensory regions (Mazaheri, et al., 2014).<nl>The present study specifically analysed the effect of arrow cues proceeding stimulus onset on alpha oscillations. It is a partial replication of Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, in which they found that alpha range amplitudes were lower in parietal areas involved in active processing 200ms before stimulus onset. In line with this, the hypothesis for this study predicts that when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe, there will be higher alpha range amplitudes for the cue left than the cue right condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>Thirty-nine undergraduate students volunteered to participate in the study after providing informed consent. One participant was not included in the analysis due to incomplete data.<nl>Design<nl>A within-subjects design was used. The independent variable was cue direction (with two levels: left and right). The dependent variable was alpha range amplitudes within the left parietal lobe in microvolts (𝜇V).<nl>Materials<nl>The EEG alpha range activity was measured using BIOPAC MP36 and 3 electrodes. AC and Everi cream were used to apply electrodes. PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker. The cues included left and right arrows (as shown in figures 1a and 1b), which informed participants which hemifield to expect the stimulus. The stimuli included small and large white bars (as shown in figures 1c and 1d). <nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>EEG alpha range activity was recorded from 3 electrodes located at the sites of the standard 10-20 system (Trans Cranial Technologies, 2012). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz and a notch filter at 50 Hz was applied. The active electrode was attached to P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz and the earth was attached to the forehead near the hairline. These were measured relative to Cz. Electrode impedance was kept at &lt;10 kΩ.<nl>Participants were asked to perform a cued visual attention task. Figure 2 illustrates a typical trial sequence and time course of events. Each participant sat on a chair in front of a computer screen and completed a consent form. Then, the experimenter applied electrodes on the participant’s scalp and gave them task instructions. Participants were told that a cue would appear to indicate which side of the screen to expect a stimulus, followed by a brief pause where they would attend to a central fixation cross. Then, a small or large bar stimulus would appear, and they would respond accordingly using the keyboard. Each participant performed 12 practice trials with feedback (3 blocks of 4 trials) to familiarise themselves with the task, followed by 80 experimental trials without feedback (20 blocks of 4 trials). Trial types (cue right small bar, cue right large bar, cue left small bar, cue left large bar) were randomised within each block. Each trial began with a central fixation cross presented on the screen for 800ms. An arrow cue, which pointed either left or right, was briefly presented for 35ms. The direction of the arrow indicates which visual hemifield the target stimulus would appear. After a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between 200ms and 1200ms (800ms for practice trials), a target stimulus was presented for 50ms. A random ISI prevented participants from anticipating exactly when each stimulus would appear. Then, an event marker was sent at stimulus onset. Different markers were sent for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli were either small or large white bars, presented on a black background. Participants responded by pressing the ‘L’ key if the bar was large and the ‘S’ key if the bar was small. Finally, the experimenter removed the electrodes and debriefed participants.<nl><figure><nl>Results<nl>Data treatment<nl>Event markers were sent from PsychoPy to Biopac to identify when stimuli were presented. The period 200ms before stimulus onset, after arrow cues had been shown, was analysed for cue left and cue right conditions. The raw alpha data was rectified to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. Rectifying converted all negative values to positive, to get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Then, the data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of outlying values and smooth the data. The transformed data will be known as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl>Data analysis<nl><table><nl>The normality of data was assessed. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the cue left (W = .83, n = 38, p &lt; .001) and cue right (W = .85, n = 38, p &lt; .001) conditions were significant. Therefore, the data was not normally distributed, and non-parametric statistics were used.<nl>Table 1 shows that median RAAA were .02 higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. A Wilcoxon signed-rank rest indicated that this difference was statistically significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .002).<nl>Discussion<nl>The results of the present study support the hypothesis that there is significantly higher alpha amplitudes for cue left than cue right conditions when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe. These results are consistent with the AIH, as alpha activity was higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention (Worden, et al., 2000; Kelly, et al., 2006) which indicates supression and disengagment of the task-irrelevant hemisphere (Klimesch, et al., 2007). Furthmore, these results are consistent with Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) experiment, because from -200ms to stimulus presentation, there was stronger alpha suppression contralateral to the cued hemifield. Hence, the findings highlight the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and their crucial role in gating attention through the inhibition of irrelevant information (Mazaheri, et al., 2014).<nl>Although the results clearly support the hypothesis, it is appropriate to recognise potential limitations. A first limitation concerns the distractive environment the experiment was conducted in. There were multiple groups working simultaneously in a lab on campus. Typical distractions included students chattering, experimenters speaking loudly and ongoing lectures. It is possible that these distracted and averted the visual attention of participants away from the task (Hughes, 2014). Therefore, future researchers must ensure that the study is conducted in a silent, non-distractive environment. <nl>Another limitation is that the present results cannot be generalised to the wider population. Studies found that cue-induced alpha lateralization was observed in younger, but not older adults (Hong, Sun, Bengson, Mangun, &amp; Tong, 2015). This suggests that younger and older adults may engage in different neural mechanisms of attentional orienting, and that the AIH is a phenomenon that diminishes through aging. Thus, further research must be conducted using a large, diverse sample of participants.<nl>Despite these limitations, one application of the present study is that individuals can be trained to enhance the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations. Kerr, et al., (2011) found that mindfulness meditation enhanced cue-induced alpha modulation. By improving people’s ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information, they can be more effectively focus their attention. <nl>To conclude, the present research replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings and contributes to a growing body of evidence to suggest that alpha range activity is supressed in areas of visual cortex involved in active processing. Despite limitations, the data are valid as they are consistent with previous research and theory. Therefore, the study provides clear support for the AIH being a robust cortical response.",

Participants were told that a cue would appear to indicate which side of the screen to expect a stimulus, followed by a brief pause where they would attend to a central fixation cross. Then, a small or large bar stimulus would appear, and they would respond accordingly using the keyboard. Each participant performed 12 practice trials with feedback (3 blocks of 4 trials) to familiarise themselves with the task, followed by 80 experimental trials without feedback (20 blocks of 4 trials). Trial types (cue right small bar, cue right large bar, cue left small bar, cue left large bar) were randomised within each block. Each trial began with a central fixation cross presented on the screen for 800ms. An arrow cue, which pointed either left or right, was briefly presented for 35ms. The direction of the arrow indicates which visual hemifield the target stimulus would appear. After a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between 200ms and 1200ms (800ms for practice trials), a target stimulus was presented for 50ms. A random ISI prevented participants from anticipating exactly when each stimulus would appear. Then, an event marker was sent at stimulus onset. Different markers were sent for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli were either small or large white bars, presented on a black background. Participants responded by pressing the ‘L’ key if the bar was large and the ‘S’ key if the bar was small. Finally, the experimenter removed the electrodes and debriefed participants. Results Data treatment Event markers were sent from PsychoPy to Biopac to identify when stimuli were presented. The period 200ms before stimulus onset, after arrow cues had been shown, was analysed for cue left and cue right conditions. The raw alpha data was rectified to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. Rectifying converted all negative values to positive, to get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Then, the data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of outlying values and smooth the data. The transformed data will be known as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). Data analysis The normality of data was assessed. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the cue left (W = .83, n = 38, p < .001) and cue right (W = .85, n = 38, p < .001) conditions were significant. Therefore, the data was not normally distributed, and non-parametric statistics were used. Table 1 shows that median RAAA were .02 higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. A Wilcoxon signed-rank rest indicated that this difference was statistically significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .002). Discussion The results of the present study support the hypothesis that there is significantly higher alpha amplitudes for cue left than cue right conditions when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe. These results are consistent with the AIH, as alpha activity was higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention (Worden, et al., 2000; Kelly, et al., 2006) which indicates supression and disengagment of the task-irrelevant hemisphere (Klimesch, et al., 2007). Furthmore, these results are consistent with Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) experiment, because from -200ms to stimulus presentation, there was stronger alpha suppression contralateral to the cued hemifield. Hence, the findings highlight the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and their crucial role in gating attention through the inhibition of irrelevant information (Mazaheri, et al., 2014). Although the results clearly support the hypothesis, it is appropriate to recognise potential limitations. A first limitation concerns the distractive environment the experiment was conducted in. There were multiple groups working simultaneously in a lab on campus. Typical distractions included students chattering, experimenters speaking loudly and ongoing lectures. It is possible that these distracted and averted the visual attention of participants away from the task (Hughes, 2014). Therefore, future researchers must ensure that the study is conducted in a silent, non-distractive environment. Another limitation is that the present results cannot be generalised to the wider population. Studies found that cue-induced alpha lateralization was observed in younger, but not older adults (Hong, Sun, Bengson, Mangun, and Tong, 2015). This suggests that younger and older adults may engage in different neural mechanisms of attentional orienting, and that the AIH is a phenomenon that diminishes through aging. Thus, further research must be conducted using a large, diverse sample of participants. Despite these limitations, one application of the present study is that individuals can be trained to enhance the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations. Kerr, et al., (2011) found that mindfulness meditation enhanced cue-induced alpha modulation. By improving people’s ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information, they can be more effectively focus their attention. <nl>To conclude, the present research replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings and contributes to a growing body of evidence to suggest that alpha range activity is supressed in areas of visual cortex involved in active processing. Despite limitations, the data are valid as they are consistent with previous research and theory. Therefore, the study provides clear support for the AIH being a robust cortical response."

      "raw_text": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the £200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for £308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for £250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra £16 per night (totalling £342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking.

      "raw_text": "The topic of research investigated was Perception of Beauty, this topic was chosen as a result of its major current infleunce within today’s society from influencing an individual’s perception of beauty about themselves and beauty as a social construct. Furthermore, the perception surrounding beauty has not just been relevant to within today’s society it also has had major influences throughout history in terms of the ideal body image evidently seen with icons such as Marilyn Monroe and desired hairstyles amongst culture throughout history. A Discourse Analysis inspired by Willig (2001) take on discourse, was used as it allowed for in depth understanding of themes and constructs which arose from the broad topic of beauty. Followed by the practices of these constructs whilst also adopting a subjective approach based on the interviewees experience. <nl>In addition, using a semi-structured interview was useful for this topic of research as it allowed for both freedom and interpretation of beauty whilst maintaining focus on the interviewees’ perception of beauty.  To ensure confidentiality the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Susan. <nl>Discourse 1- ‘Beauty is beyond skin deep’ <nl>When asked to define beauty Susan’s demonstrates immediately categorises beauty into two categories ‘superficial’ and ‘deeper beauty’. Susan’s attitude towards the discourse of superficial beauty has already been perceived as negative, this is evident through the depth of explanation in which both types of beauty are described. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s shallow explanation of the discourse of superficial beauty positions herself throughout interview as having a negative view of beauty being based on the outward appearance. This again is reiterated through her humour on the discourse, as she states ‘it’s like your outward beauty can get you so far coz you know when you grow old… You get a litt’l crusty’. The choice of the word ‘crusty’, suggests that one’s perception of beauty only being based on outward appearance is futile, as it essentially it will no longer be the determining factor of beauty.<nl>Contrastingly, Susan’s’ in-depth explanation on the discourse of inward beauty suggests the value in which she holds inward beauty as better a perception of beauty to have. The discursive list such as ‘character’, ‘personality’ and behaviour demonstrate the longevity of that aspect of beauty and its hierarchy which constructs Susan’s perception of beauty as it surpasses artificial beauty. <nl>Despite Susan positioning of inward beauty, it can be argued that the opposition of both discursive catergories highlights a sense of wanting inclusivity and identity in the way in which beauty is perceived. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s avoidance of wanting to admit that superficial is more prominent than inner beauty, constructs the feeling of otherness surrounding outward appearance as it connotes a sense of isolation and division from what she desires to be beautiful versus society’s ideals of beauty. The themes which arise from the conflict of these discourses run throughout the interview. As Susan repeatedly positions herself against societies ideals of beauty and her own, this is evident through the consistent use of discursive pronouns ‘I feel likeI think’ and her separation from society as she states, ‘but in nowadays’ (lines 39 and 52).<nl>Furthermore, Susan further demonstrates the discourse of inclusivity through the specific type of social influencers she uses in response to the question asked in line 73.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The examples used by Susan reaffirms this discourse, as the role models appear to display characteristics of the average human such as ‘embracing her tummy’. This non-superficial beauty demonstrated by the role models brings forth implications that Susan’s perception of beauty can also be accepted despite society’s perception of beauty. Furthermore, the discursive object of authenticity, can also be drawn from the examples used in regard to have a perception of beauty that everyone can obtain, this is further seen Susan refers to both sexes. <nl>Discourse 2- Outward beauty is not always negative<nl>Despite Susan presenting the negative aspects of outward beauty it can be argued whether outward beauty is completely negative.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The discourse of style from outward beauty illustrates that outward beauty is not entirely negative as it can also be used as a guide to find one’s own beauty through style, as Susan admits that she was ‘terrible at dressing’. This also exemplifies how outward appearance constructs identity as similarly seen with Susan’s’ previous reference to Ashley Graham and Nella Rose as ‘good influences.’<nl>Moreover, within the discourse of style it can also be argued that not all aspects associated with outward beauty is superficial and negative. This is evident with the use of accessorises and ‘activities such as shaving or ear piercing’ (Sinkman, 2013), used to enhance beauty but is not deemed as a damaging percpetion of beauty concerning outward beauty, as it appears to be a construct accepted in society and to majority of individuals’. <nl>By the same token, from a business perspective it can be argued that the discourse of outward beauty is not entirely negative, regarding the profit made by brands such as L’Oréal, Mac and Huda Beauty Cosmetics, as the Business Insider reported that the beauty industry is ‘estimated worth $532 billion’. <nl>From both examples used above opposes, Susan’s initial perception surrounding the discourse of the outward appearance concerning beauty; this demonstrates the complexity surrounding the discourse of perceptions of beauty as it does not appear clear and cut.<nl>Discourse 3- The Medias’ perception of beauty is damaging<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s’ tempered response to the question asked in line 54 presents the discourse of media being the main reason behind the damaging perception of beauty in particular social media. Social media apps such as Instagram appear to be dominant discursive objects, which influence perceptions of beauty as themes such as self-gratification and acceptance. This is apparent within the example used by Susan as she illustrates a mother’s perception of beauty towards their child in comparison to Instagram’s perception of their beauty. Despite a mother voice having a significance of a child’s perception of themselves, it appears that social media drowns this voice as they quickly conclude that ‘I am not’ beautiful. This abrupt conclusion suggests that social media holds a lot weight regards to perceptions of beauty. <nl>Additionally, the repeated discourse of superficial beauty arose again in relation to the discursive object of social media, the conjunction of both discourses reaffirmed Susan negative attitude towards the discourse’s influence on beauty. This is explicitly seen with her paralinguistic such as the sucking of her teeth and laugh in line 64-65 associated with the discourses, as she refers to it as ‘fake’. Susan’s’ attitude towards the medias false perception of beauty aligns with Sinkman (2013) statement that ‘society is becoming increasingly concerned with mechanisms to obtain or improve beauty, such as beauty enhancements, body modiﬁcation.’ This is apparent within todays current concerns concerning surgeries such as Brazilian Butt Lifts to achieve the ‘ideal body type’, as statistics show that it is deadliest type of plastic surgery with 3000 cases of death. Through this statistic it reveals the social pressure as a discursive object to achieve the ideal perception of beauty.<nl>Moreover, it can also be discussed that social media such as Instagram is not the only outlet of media that produces pressure as a discursive object. Media outlets such as magazines can also present a discourse of pressure and damage about perception of beauty, this is explicit within criticism surrounds fashion magazines such as Vogue; as they were criticised for photoshopping their ‘cover to make plus-sized model look thinner’.<nl>Therefore, it can be concluded that Susan’s attitude towards these discourses holds a certain credibility about the rising concerns of beauty standards within today’s society.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan recognises that the perception of beauty discussed for majority of the interview was Westernised perceptions of beauty and recognises the other cultural perceptions of beauty. <nl>This demonstrates beauty as an ethnocentric discursive object as within every culture what is perceived as beautiful to one may be perceived undesirable to another, in addition it also shows the equal weighing of environment playing an equal factor in perceptions of beauty in correspondence to media which is normally the first considered influenced on beauty.  <nl><nl>Discourse 5- Perceptions of beauty is never fixed <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan shows that the discourse of beauty is temporal, as throughout history what was concerned as beautiful changed this is apparent through eras in history such as Egyptian Beauty and Victorian Beauty. As Egyptian beauty included both male and females going to great lengths regarding appearance, consisting of dramatic dark eye makeup and wigs in contrast to the Victorian Era which involved a pale face and rosy cheeks. The vast difference in beauty amongst these two eras demonstrates the discourse of beauty being temporal.<nl>Susan appears to present that the discourse of beauty is not completely objective or subjective but in fact there is middle ground as the discursive objects such as culture, genre, era play a role in the objective aspect of standards of beauty. Alongside with the subjective aspect in relation to having a choice in what type of beauty an individual wants to adopt. <nl>Discussion<nl>Throughout the interview the discourses presented demonstrate the complexity of perceptions of beauty. This can be seen with the two opposing aspects concerning the discourse of outward appearance, as on one spectrum it is perceived as futile as it conveys an unrealistic beauty standard to obtain. whilst on the other spectrum outward beauty in relation to style is not frowned upon as it is perceived as beauty to aspire to, in relation to providing a guide on fashion. Furthermore, this interview also demonstrated the various influences on both an individual’s perception of beauty and societal construct concerning beauty which is contingent on music genre, history era and culture. Therefore, showing a grey area in having a perception of beauty as a ones percpetion of beauty cannot be completely right or wrong.<nl><nl>",

As Susan repeatedly positions herself against societies ideals of beauty and her own, this is evident through the consistent use of discursive pronouns ‘I feel likeI think’ and her separation from society as she states, ‘but in nowadays’ (lines 39 and 52). Furthermore, Susan further demonstrates the discourse of inclusivity through the specific type of social influencers she uses in response to the question asked in line 73. The examples used by Susan reaffirms this discourse, as the role models appear to display characteristics of the average human such as ‘embracing her tummy’. This non-superficial beauty demonstrated by the role models brings forth implications that Susan’s perception of beauty can also be accepted despite society’s perception of beauty. Furthermore, the discursive object of authenticity, can also be drawn from the examples used in regard to have a perception of beauty that everyone can obtain, this is further seen Susan refers to both sexes. Discourse 2- Outward beauty is not always negative Despite Susan presenting the negative aspects of outward beauty it can be argued whether outward beauty is completely negative. The discourse of style from outward beauty illustrates that outward beauty is not entirely negative as it can also be used as a guide to find one’s own beauty through style, as Susan admits that she was ‘terrible at dressing’. This also exemplifies how outward appearance constructs identity as similarly seen with Susan’s’ previous reference to Ashley Graham and Nella Rose as ‘good influences.’ Moreover, within the discourse of style it can also be argued that not all aspects associated with outward beauty is superficial and negative. This is evident with the use of accessorises and ‘activities such as shaving or ear piercing’ (Sinkman, 2013), used to enhance beauty but is not deemed as a damaging percpetion of beauty concerning outward beauty, as it appears to be a construct accepted in society and to majority of individuals’. By the same token, from a business perspective it can be argued that the discourse of outward beauty is not entirely negative, regarding the profit made by brands such as L’Oréal, Mac and Huda Beauty Cosmetics, as the Business Insider reported that the beauty industry is ‘estimated worth $532 billion’. From both examples used above opposes, Susan’s initial perception surrounding the discourse of the outward appearance concerning beauty; this demonstrates the complexity surrounding the discourse of perceptions of beauty as it does not appear clear and cut. Discourse 3- The Medias’ perception of beauty is damaging Susan’s’ tempered response to the question asked in line 54 presents the discourse of media being the main reason behind the damaging perception of beauty in particular social media. Social media apps such as Instagram appear to be dominant discursive objects, which influence perceptions of beauty as themes such as self-gratification and acceptance. This is apparent within the example used by Susan as she illustrates a mother’s perception of beauty towards their child in comparison to Instagram’s perception of their beauty. Despite a mother voice having a significance of a child’s perception of themselves, it appears that social media drowns this voice as they quickly conclude that ‘I am not’ beautiful. This abrupt conclusion suggests that social media holds a lot weight regards to perceptions of beauty. Additionally, the repeated discourse of superficial beauty arose again in relation to the discursive object of social media, the conjunction of both discourses reaffirmed Susan negative attitude towards the discourse’s influence on beauty. This is explicitly seen with her paralinguistic such as the sucking of her teeth and laugh in line 64-65 associated with the discourses, as she refers to it as ‘fake’. Susan’s’ attitude towards the medias false perception of beauty aligns with Sinkman (2013) statement that ‘society is becoming increasingly concerned with mechanisms to obtain or improve beauty, such as beauty enhancements, body modiﬁcation.’ This is apparent within todays current concerns concerning surgeries such as Brazilian Butt Lifts to achieve the ‘ideal body type’, as statistics show that it is deadliest type of plastic surgery with 3000 cases of death. Through this statistic it reveals the social pressure as a discursive object to achieve the ideal perception of beauty. Moreover, it can also be discussed that social media such as Instagram is not the only outlet of media that produces pressure as a discursive object. Media outlets such as magazines can also present a discourse of pressure and damage about perception of beauty, this is explicit within criticism surrounds fashion magazines such as Vogue; as they were criticised for photoshopping their ‘cover to make plus-sized model look thinner’. Therefore, it can be concluded that Susan’s attitude towards these discourses holds a certain credibility about the rising concerns of beauty standards within today’s society. Susan recognises that the perception of beauty discussed for majority of the interview was Westernised perceptions of beauty and recognises the other cultural perceptions of beauty. This demonstrates beauty as an ethnocentric discursive object as within every culture what is perceived as beautiful to one may be perceived undesirable to another, in addition it also shows the equal weighing of environment playing an equal factor in perceptions of beauty in correspondence to media which is normally the first considered influenced on beauty. Discourse 5- Perceptions of beauty is never fixed Susan shows that the discourse of beauty is temporal, as throughout history what was concerned as beautiful changed this is apparent through eras in history such as Egyptian Beauty and Victorian Beauty. As Egyptian beauty included both male and females going to great lengths regarding appearance, consisting of dramatic dark eye makeup and wigs in contrast to the Victorian Era which involved a pale face and rosy cheeks. The vast difference in beauty amongst these two eras demonstrates the discourse of beauty being temporal. Susan appears to present that the discourse of beauty is not completely objective or subjective but in fact there is middle ground as the discursive objects such as culture, genre, era play a role in the objective aspect of standards of beauty. Alongside with the subjective aspect in relation to having a choice in what type of beauty an individual wants to adopt. Discussion Throughout the interview the discourses presented demonstrate the complexity of perceptions of beauty. This can be seen with the two opposing aspects concerning the discourse of outward appearance, as on one spectrum it is perceived as futile as it conveys an unrealistic beauty standard to obtain. whilst on the other spectrum outward beauty in relation to style is not frowned upon as it is perceived as beauty to aspire to, in relation to providing a guide on fashion. Furthermore, this interview also demonstrated the various influences on both an individual’s perception of beauty and societal construct concerning beauty which is contingent on music genre, history era and culture. Therefore, showing a grey area in having a perception of beauty as a ones percpetion of beauty cannot be completely right or wrong."

      "raw_text": "Within the study of Psychology, the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspectives have contributed immensely in relation to its similarities and differences of its core assumptions and features. As the assumptions within the Biological perspective consist on behaviour being solely a result of biology such as neurotransmitter and genetics; in comparison to the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective which consist of behaviour-based experiences within the environment and the unconscious. In the following essay, I will discuss the key features and assumptions of both perspectives revolving around their similarities and differences. <nl>The Biological Perspective adopts the nature approach to behaviour, as its assumptions solely revolve around the concept of behaviour is hard-wired. This is evident within its explanation for disorders such as Schizophrenia as Gottesman (1991) found that Monozygotic twins hold the highest percentage of 48% who are at a ‘Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia\" in comparison to the 1% of the General population. This statistic supports the nature adoption of the biological perspective, as it states that behaviour is a result of Heredity as result of monozygotic twins sharing 100% of their genes. <nl>On the contrary, the Psychoanalytical perspective adopts both nature and nurture approach within its assumptions. As Freud proposed the assumption that our behaviour is controlled by the tripartite construction of the mind consisting of the Id, Superego and Ego.  Freud (1949) states that the Id \"contains everything that is inherited\"; this concept of inheritance similarly aligns with the biological perspective of nature having an influence on behaviour. As the Id is considered as the primitive part of the mind which includes innate instincts \"which are sexual in nature and the death instincts such as aggression\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 118). Alongside the nature aspect of this perspective, this perspective also adopts a nurture approach to behaviour in relation to the environment also having a major influence on behaviour. This is evident within the super-ego component of Freud's theory of the mind which is shaped by societal values and family upbringing.  This is developed during childhood essentially acting as a conscience within behaviour and moral guidance in \"attempting to thwart id desires\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 119). In addition to the super-ego, this perspective emphasis on nurture is also evident within Freud's Psychosexual stages of development. As the process of each stage contributes to the development of one's personality, for example during the ages 4-6 gender identity is formed through Oedipus complex (for males) and Electra complex (for females) during this Phallic stage the child will experience unconscious sexual desires for their opposite-sex parent. This unconscious desire is resolved through the child identifying with the same sex parent, therefore, leading the child to form an appropriate affection for their opposite-sex parent. However, Freud proposed the idea if this conflict was not resolved it would result in complex behaviours such as promiscuity and narcissism.<nl>Despite, both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective varying within the nature or nurture approach to behaviour, both perspectives possess a deterministic view of behaviour. As the core assumptions of the Biological Perspective holds the view that behaviour is solely a result of genetic factors and biological components. Similarly, the Psychoanalytical perspective upholds the same notion of determinism in its explanation of behaviour being controlled by instinct drives alongside with the environment also having control over behaviour.<nl>A further difference within these perspectives is the approach in relation to explaining its core assumptions. The Biological perspective adopts a reductionist approach in its explanation of behaviour as it attempts to explain behaviour through simple components such as genes, brain structure and neurotransmitters. This is evident within findings that serotonin and dopamine have a ‘signalling effect on later-life in relation to somatosensory, anxiety and depression' (Suri et al, 2015, p. 318); therefore, this supports the reductionist view of the biological explanation as it reduces complex disorders such as depression to neurochemical basis. Alternatively, the psychoanalytical perspective adopts both a reductionist and holistic approach to explaining behaviour. The use of reductionism is evident within Freud's' explanation of reducing behaviour to the instinctive drives within the unconscious mind. Despite this, this his approach differs as he also adopts a holistic view of behaviour as he considers the individual. This is apparent within the case of Anna O, who suffered from Hysteria a psychological disorder which involved psychological stress manifesting into physical symptoms such as ‘multiple personalities, speech difficulties, bizarre hallucinations, and inability to drink' (Benjamin, 2007, p. 116); these physical manifestations were a result of her grief from her father's death. This case supports the holistic feature in the Psychoanalytical perspective, as it considers other factors alongside unconscious drives which contribute to behaviour in comparison to the core assumptions of the biological approach which is narrow in its assumption. <nl>Furthermore, alongside the difference in their approach to explaining behaviour both perspectives also vary in investigating their core assumptions. The biological perspective is reliant on quantitative methods which provide objective measurements such as brain scans to measure the brain and behaviour; this is apparent within methods such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) which measures the blood flow of the cerebral cortex; consequently, thus providing support for the key biological features of the perspective.  This is evidently seen within research into disorders such as Depression as fMRI scans showed that depressed patients \"demonstrated more pronounced connection between the right frontal eye field and cerebellar area \"in comparison to healthy patients who demonstrated \"showed stronger connectivity between more than 20 frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions of interest and cerebellum\" (Bezmaternykh, D.D. et al, 2018, p. 734).  <nl>Alternatively, the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective revolve around qualitative methods which are subjective in nature. This is apparent with the case of Anna O as discussed above which is a central feature within the Psychoanalytical Perspective as it paved a way for the use of subjective methods such as talking therapy; therefore, providing a deeper insight on the individual than solely on numerical data as evident above within the biological perspective. <nl>By the same token, both perspectives also differ on carrying a scientific discipline whether its assumptions and features can be falsified. This is evident within the consistent falsification of the biological approach. This is evident within the contribution towards the theory of Neurons through the work of Golgi and Cajal. As Golgi produced the ‘first clear pictures of nerve cells' through a staining technique from this he inferred that the nervous system consisted of many neurones but was physically connected to each other (Goodwin, 2015 pg. 74-75). In opposition to the work of Golgi, Cajal proposed the idea that neurones were not physically connected to each other using Golgi's staining technique to support his claim. As result of the falsification of Golgi's theory, Cajal’s work has had a major contribution to the key features of the biological perspective due to the gap between the neurones to now be known as the synapse, this being a pinnacle feature of the biological perspective to explaining the behaviour through neurotransmitters.  From the consistent vulnerability to falsification within the features of the biological perspective, it is apparent that the perspective holds a scientific discipline. <nl>However, it can be argued that the Psychoanalytical perspective holds a similar scientific discipline in relation falsifiability as Hunt (2009) refers to Freud's work being ‘fiercely attacked on one ground or another' therefore providing the psychoanalytical approach with some scientific discipline as its assumptions can be both ‘strengthened and weakened' (pg. 225). This is evident within the development of Neo-Freudians such as Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who rejected the oversexualised perspective associated with Freud's psychoanalytical perspective but focused on the social aspect regarding primary determinates of behaviour such as environment and uniqueness of individuals. Therefore, introducing a different branch from the Psychoanalytical perspective as Individual Psychology. <nl>Finally, despite possessing a similar element of scientific discipline, the psychoanalytical perspective contrasts the biological perspective regarding its scientific credibility due to the subjective nature present within the core assumptions. This is evident within the feature of the Psychosexual stages regarding the development of gender as Freud argued that female gender identity was formed from possessing penis envy as they believed to have been castrated. This theory of female identity essentially within psychoanalytical perspective essentially lacks the scientific discipline in comparison to biological perspective as this feature within the assumption appears to base on ‘Freud's views of women' than evidence and fact. (Benjamin, 2007, p. 130).<nl>In conclusion, despite both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective holding majority of differences within their assumptions alongside the nature of their key features holding similarities both perspectives have successfully become an integral part of Psychology today.",

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>The non-binary gender movement is seen as a relatively new phenomenon due to increased activism in the years 2015 and 2016 (Richards, Bouman, &amp; Barker, 2017). Campaigning for awareness and inclusion by organisations such as the Non-Binary Inclusion Project has brought the conversation into mainstream society, however there is a longer supressed history. Consequently, there is very limited literature regarding non-binary individuals and the social attitudes towards them. Day and Nicholls’ (2019) produced a paper exploring attitudes of non-transgender students towards transgender people which induced interest in the presented research topic. As history has progressed, society has shown to become more accepting of people and ideas that lay outside the norm. However, statistics by YouGov show that 41% of trans people and 31% of non-binary people have experienced a hate crime in the last 12 months (YouGov, 2017). Therefore, research is needed to establish whether attitudes have truly changed.<nl><nl>The research question I was looking to investigate was \"What attitudes are present towards those who identify as non-binary?\". Key discourses to uncover include; what is considered normal with gender, the challenges non-binary people face and whether society is widely accepting of these individuals. This led to the development of the semi-structured interview schedule included as appendix 1. Looking at attitudes towards non-binary individuals meant a participant who was not non-binary could be selected. This facilitated discourse analysis and Willig’s 6-stage process was followed (Willig, 2008). Due to confidentiality reasons, the interviewee will be referred to as Anna.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Key discourses identified refer to the construction of \"others\", identification as a choice and the fluctuating permanence of societal views.<nl><nl>Construction of Others<nl>Anna used language in a way that constructed non-binary people as being separate others. Individuals were spoken about as if they were distinctly different to the interviewee, who identifies as a cisgender female, and to other members of society. This demonstrates the normalisation of identifying as your assigned sex at birth and the rejection of people who do not fit into the norm.<nl><data_extract><nl>The choice of wording being \"experienced something\" to describe non-binary identification almost has connotations of a religious or spiritual awakening. It seems to suggest that non-binary people have had an association with a higher power which had led them to think that they are more than male or female. As gender governs human lives, perhaps non-binary individuals are likened to being more than human. This comment is significant as it regards non-binary people in a higher respect than people who identify with just one gender. Even though they are considered to be others, this may be in a positive rather than negative light. The use of \"experience\" also assumes that non-binary individuals have not always felt this way and that something has occurred in order for this identification to proceed. This indicates a conscious choice, a discourse that will be explored further on.<nl>Despite the previous positive symbolism, Anna goes on to express the need for another category for non-binary people. She initially used the word \"definitely\", which has strong intentions, when explaining that this should be the case. This was retracted when repeating the end of the sentence suggesting that this was misspoke. This could indicate that this was her true opinion which may have then been altered in order to appear more socially acceptable and to fit in with the general consensus of a progressive society. This signifies that society as a whole may not be as complicit in ‘othering’ behaviour as Anna was herself.<nl><data_extract><nl>Again, Anna has added to the discourse of othering by the use of the phrase \"something else\" to refer to non-binary individuals. The choice of the word \"thing\" rather than person is dehumanising and creates a distance between her and non-binary individuals. Anna is no longer able to relate to the \"thing\" and an outgroup has been created. Social identity theory states that members of an ingroup believe that their ingroup is distinctive from and superior to the outgroup which then leads to discrimination against outgroups (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). <nl>In this situation, non-binary individuals are considered to be inferior which aids prejudicial treatment.<nl><nl>In contrast to this, Anna uses the word \"we\" when saying \"we’re living in a free world\". Using this discursive tool places the interviewer, participant, non-binary and gender conforming individuals into the same societal group. This assumes that the free world is for everyone and the same privileges are received by all. She considers non-binary individuals to have the freedom to express themselves how they desire without persecution, which suggests a wider belief that society is permitting of people acting how they choose to. However, this does not indicate that negative attitudes have ceased, rather that people are just choosing to suppress verbal opinions.<nl><nl>Identification as a Choice<nl>Anna heavily drew upon discourses which presented non-binary identification as a conscious choice. Individuals were considered to have alternative experiences to those who identified with their assigned sex which led them towards their identification. This reveals how identifying with your biological sex is considered to be the default and other identifications are decision based.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna has used the term \"believe\" once again when referring to non-binary people. Belief is an expression commonly used when declaring concepts that are intangible or that do not have a scientific basis, for example religion or mythical beings. Likening non-binary people’s existence to something that is either believed in or not indicates that their presence is not acknowledged by society as being authentic. By describing non-binary individuals in this way, it is extremely damaging to their sense of identity. Findings by Johnson et al. (2019) showed that invalidation in multiple social contexts contributed to negative affective and cognitive processes for non-binary adolescents which included confusion, self-doubt and internalised shame. This demonstrates that unconscious negative biases are held in society and these have detrimental effects for non-binary people.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"that’s become quite popular at the moment\" when talking about how people are identifying as non-binary. This is important as it does not denote permanence and likens this movement to a trend or a song. It suggests that people may decide to identify as non-binary while it is popular this year, but this phenomenon will be seen to disappear again as soon as it arrived. By using language in this way to create the discourse of choice, the experiences of non-binary people are invalidated. Their personal struggles with identity are minimised or even dismissed and struggles with stereotyping and bullying are disregarded.<nl><nl>Additionally, by using the word \"recently\" she does not acknowledge the rich and diverse history of non-binary identification and the consequences that derived from identifying in this way. This is due to a lack of knowledge and reflects the lack of queer education in society. A report from GLAAD found that increased knowledge about LGBT people led to lower levels of discomfort towards this community and reduced LBGT discrimination (GLAAD, 2014). This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change.<nl><nl>Permanence of Societal Views<nl>Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. <nl><data_extract><nl>This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn’t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive. This negative outlook suggests that individuals in society are focused on keeping the superiority of their own ingroup, at the cost of the well-being of the non-binary out group.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"at the moment\" 5 times during the course of the interview. This was used when comparing non-binary activism to various social movements such as feminism, gender equality and Black Lives Matter. By using words such as \"minute\" and \"moment\", social movements are perceived to be current and short natured. This may show that years of activism go unnoticed by society if it does not benefit the majority. By constructing language in this way, Anna demonstrates how society is only able to comprehend one change at a time. Feminism is the sole focus and only when this is achieved, will non-binary issues take the forefront.<nl><nl>Anna also uses the word \"they\" when talking about equality. This choice of word removes responsibility from herself for actioning change. This suggests that only certain people hold this power, potentially only those in authority. This stance would explain why non-binary progression in society is slow as it reflects the belief that not everyone is in the position to make a difference. People either do not recognise that they could be valuable allies in fighting for queer rights, or they do not believe it is their place. By using language like this, Anna is recognising that non-binary individuals are not considered to have achieved equality in society. <nl><nl>To Conclude<nl>In deconstructing the language used by Anna to describe non-binary people, a main negative attitude prevailed which may be due to a lack of understanding. Discourses constructed non-binary individuals as being distinctly different to the interviewee and identifying this way by choice. Social attitudes were also constructed as having varying permanence. The inconsistencies uncovered reflect that there may be diverse social attitudes towards non-binary individuals.",

Likening non-binary people’s existence to something that is either believed in or not indicates that their presence is not acknowledged by society as being authentic. By describing non-binary individuals in this way, it is extremely damaging to their sense of identity. Findings by Johnson et al. (2019) showed that invalidation in multiple social contexts contributed to negative affective and cognitive processes for non-binary adolescents which included confusion, self-doubt and internalised shame. This demonstrates that unconscious negative biases are held in society and these have detrimental effects for non-binary people. Anna used the phrase \"that’s become quite popular at the moment\" when talking about how people are identifying as non-binary. This is important as it does not denote permanence and likens this movement to a trend or a song. It suggests that people may decide to identify as non-binary while it is popular this year, but this phenomenon will be seen to disappear again as soon as it arrived. By using language in this way to create the discourse of choice, the experiences of non-binary people are invalidated. Their personal struggles with identity are minimised or even dismissed and struggles with stereotyping and bullying are disregarded. Additionally, by using the word \"recently\" she does not acknowledge the rich and diverse history of non-binary identification and the consequences that derived from identifying in this way. This is due to a lack of knowledge and reflects the lack of queer education in society. A report from GLAAD found that increased knowledge about LGBT people led to lower levels of discomfort towards this community and reduced LBGT discrimination (GLAAD, 2014). This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change. Permanence of Societal Views Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn’t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive. This negative outlook suggests that individuals in society are focused on keeping the superiority of their own ingroup, at the cost of the well-being of the non-binary out group. Anna used the phrase \"at the moment\" 5 times during the course of the interview. This was used when comparing non-binary activism to various social movements such as feminism, gender equality and Black Lives Matter. By using words such as \"minute\" and \"moment\", social movements are perceived to be current and short natured. This may show that years of activism go unnoticed by society if it does not benefit the majority. By constructing language in this way, Anna demonstrates how society is only able to comprehend one change at a time. Feminism is the sole focus and only when this is achieved, will non-binary issues take the forefront. Anna also uses the word \"they\" when talking about equality. This choice of word removes responsibility from herself for actioning change. This suggests that only certain people hold this power, potentially only those in authority. This stance would explain why non-binary progression in society is slow as it reflects the belief that not everyone is in the position to make a difference. People either do not recognise that they could be valuable allies in fighting for queer rights, or they do not believe it is their place. By using language like this, Anna is recognising that non-binary individuals are not considered to have achieved equality in society. To Conclude In deconstructing the language used by Anna to describe non-binary people, a main negative attitude prevailed which may be due to a lack of understanding. Discourses constructed non-binary individuals as being distinctly different to the interviewee and identifying this way by choice. Social attitudes were also constructed as having varying permanence. The inconsistencies uncovered reflect that there may be diverse social attitudes towards non-binary individuals."

      "fixed_text": "Gershom, I have filled out the form, but I would still like to know if you believe this is the right decision. My main reason for conducting the interviews is because there is limited explicit information on the subject, and I don't want my dissertation to be based on a hunch. Although this will include 8 participants, I understand this can't generalise the native nationality and British nationality on a whole, but it can provide valid evidence for the perceptions. Please let me know your final thoughts, if you believe I should proceed without doing the interviews I will do so. . Hi Lolly, I sent my ethics form over to Sebastiano and I copied you in. When you do see the form, I would like your final opinion on whether I should proceed or not. Also, should I mention interviews in my methodology section for my proposal? Or should I just speak about the sources I’ve used for my literature review? Thank you for your help thus far! . ﻿ Hi Nalani, Apologies for my late reply. Thank you so much for your help I really appreciate it. I can’t seem to find the engagement report, could you please let me know how to access it? Also, I opted for question 1 because the other question seem challenging for me. Being analytical is one of my strong points so I think question 1 tailors to it. Once again, thank you for your help. P.S. I hope your son is getting better. . Hi Loralee, Just an additional thought! I went on the questions again and question 2 also sounds interesting. I will also consider that question. Probably by the end of this week, I will make up my mind. Thanks once again . Hi Davide, I’m happy to hear your son is feeling better! I will definitely take your advice and make sure I select the one that can be done, and also enjoyable. In regards to question 2, when it says developed countries would you say I take generally or speak generally and then use case examples for instance the U.K., Switzerland etc. Hope to hear from you soon ."

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl><nl>The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one’s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted ‘U’ shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galván, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob’s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents’ susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain’s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents’ vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual’s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC’s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).",

      "raw_text": "Regarding the information I have gathered for the CEO's trip to Helsinki, I have managed to find a multitude of things ranging from hotels to souvenir shops for her children. To start of with, the hotel I thought would be the best fit is the Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel, due to the fact it overlooks the scenic Gulf of Finland. The hotel further has access to gyms, saunas and serves traditional and fresh food, only for Â£74 pn. It is only 1.8 miles from the centre. The next place I found for the CEO to have breakfast was Karl Fazer CafÃ©, where they serve cinnamon buns and all sorts of savoury foods. It is local to the Hotel, being a 7 minute walk or a 5 minute car ride. Next, when looking at museums to explore, 2 stood out. One being, Sea Fortress Suomenlina. This stood out as it is near water, which is what Helsinki is known for, the sea, diverse architecture and their word famous designs. This sightseeing should be around 2-3 hours, and has many castles to visit including historical castles. The second was the Island and Open Air museum, this is more outdoor and is populated by many restaurants. This museum has been described as 'breath-taking', which is why it is also one that stood out. In regards to the souvenir shop, Kankufin Tapa was the highest rated one. This was because of the small homemade souvenirs, which can be easily to transport from different countries. For entertainment purposes, G-Livelab is the best place to go for live music, and for jazz. There is an event happening on the 4th September. Lastly, in relation to food, the restaurant that was highly rated was Kanstan Moljo. Though this is a buffet, it was highly rated because you can try a variety of traditional foods without having to commit to a whole meal. Additionally, it one of the few places that didn't serve solely salmon, there was alternatives such as reindeer meat, moose meat as well pork stew. These will allow for the CEO to not feel as though she is only faced with one option and that being seafood.",

The hotel further has access to gyms, saunas and serves traditional and fresh food, only for Â£74 pn. It is only 1.8 miles from the centre. The next place I found for the CEO to have breakfast was Karl Fazer CafÃ©, where they serve cinnamon buns and all sorts of savoury foods. It is local to the Hotel, being a 7 minute walk or a 5 minute car ride. Next, when looking at museums to explore, 2 stood out. One being, Sea Fortress Suomenlina. This stood out as it is near water, which is what Helsinki is known for, the sea, diverse architecture and their word famous designs. This sightseeing should be around 2-3 hours, and has many castles to visit including historical castles. The second was the Island and Open Air museum, this is more outdoor and is populated by many restaurants. This museum has been described as 'breath-taking', which is why it is also one that stood out. In regards to the souvenir shop, Kankufin Tapa was the highest rated one. This was because of the small homemade souvenirs, which can be easily to transport from different countries. For entertainment purposes, G-Livelab is the best place to go for live music, and for jazz. There is an event happening on the 4th September. Lastly, in relation to food, the restaurant that was highly rated was Kanstan Moljo. Though this is a buffet, it was highly rated because you can try a variety of traditional foods without having to commit to a whole meal. Additionally, it one of the few places that didn't serve solely salmon, there was alternatives such as reindeer meat, moose meat as well pork stew. These will allow for the CEO to not feel as though she is only faced with one option and that being seafood."

Though it poses ‘immediate danger to the foundations of the law’  it holds a certain appeal within Equity. Further, it will criticise Birk’s position that this ‘amorphous concept’ simply conceals to private intuition. As this piece progresses, opinions of scholars who propose unique and interesting alternatives will be analysed with the final position being that Birks’ does not wholly present a modern perspective on such a diverse definition. <nl><nl>Outdated approach<nl>Perhaps to consider the role of conscience within legal disputes, one should turn to their private intuition. However, to venture into this ‘uncertain terrain’, by adopting a narrow approach, the courts are reversing the trends of equity. Birk’s reliance upon private intuition directly contradicts legal decision-making and therefore, for judges to rely on their intuitive conscience gives rise to additional subjectivity and seriously harms the rule of law. Nonetheless, it raises the concern as to why this indefinable concept of unconscionability should be accepted. Maxwell states that this terminology conflicts with values of certainty; the law must facilitate prediction rather than accept terms which are heavily subjective and uncertain. <nl><nl>Additionally, though conscience can be criticized for its ‘judicial moral subjectivism’, when judges make these decisions, they are essentially moral and based on ‘normative practices (…) that already exist in society and outside the law’. Therefore, this private intuition is really the perception individuals have when interpreting external standards of morality and Dworkin asserts that judges interpret this morality by presupposing laws of the community. Instead, the flawed doctrine of Equity gives rise to scepticism as opposed to conscience itself. <nl><nl>Conscience, subjectivity &amp; The Rule of Law <nl>To understand conscience, it is vital to consider opinions of scholars when assessing the truth in Birks’ statement. Perhaps looking at the rule of law can provide better clarification. Harding suggests that there must be a ‘counterbalance’ for the continued use of unconscionability because society can lose respect for the law if legal rules are not strictly applied in situations where exploitation of unjust outcomes are used for personal gain. Though conscience is ‘expressive’, it remains impossible to anticipate eventuality, therefore, mechanisms must be established to protect formal rules from being opportunistically exploited. Equity serves as this very mechanism by supplementing common law and the adjustment of rules adhering to extra-legal standards. Here, different observations of equity are presented and Birks’ reliance on intuition seems questionable. <nl><nl>When observing conscience in equity, formal rules have been altered to make perfect moral sense. In common law and equitable liabilities, the courts consider ‘moral clarity’ rather than blindly following law. There is an evaluative aspect here where subjective interpretation is necessary to encourage ‘moral deliberation’. Moreover, it is odd to refute inherent subjectivity within private law reasoning. This encourages a mechanical, undesirable process inhibiting the progression of equity. Nonetheless, when considering these obligations, not all moral duties can be enforceable and there is great debate on whether legal obligations ‘invariably’ gives rise to moral ones. But should it be accepted that equitable obligations enforce moral duties, the individual must consider what they should morally do as opposed to what the law asserts. <nl><nl>Agnew suggests that instead of ‘private intuition’, reflecting morally upon a situation contributes to the authority of private law with ‘moral legitimacy’ being easier accepted. It is easier to conform to this ideal in contrast to Birks’ highly plain and systematic approach. However, Birks critiques remain superior in that invocation of conscience in relation to equitable obligations generate great confusion and legal uncertainty. This does not seem to be a ‘realistic aspiration’ of the law. Confusion arises where it is difficult to assume differences between directly enforceable moral duties, and equitable obligations that have no legal standing. Agnew proposes that to limit conscience to cases where courts underwrite moral duties as legal or equitable obligations seems more appropriate. There is greater transparency but its ‘explanatory limits’ must be properly understood. This would fix the need to rely on personal intuition. Nonetheless, courts must be willing to accept a precautionary approach by addressing the confusion conscience poses in the first place.  <nl><nl>The influence of conscience in the courts <nl>Though conscience prevents the ‘rigidity of rules’, its unspecific nature leaves plenty of debate regarding its judicial discretion and capricious outcomes’. Firstly, equitable remedies must be freely available when the claimant’s sole action is to prove unconsciousable behaviour. Case law supports this position with judges asserting that demonstrating unconscionability would suffice. Lord Denning submits that when combining resulting and constructive trusts, they can be imposed ‘where justice and good conscience require it’. Nonetheless, critique indeed expected. In the case of Lloyd’s Bank Plc v Rossett, concern over this broader approach was quickly reined in by the House of Lords and the shift towards a more selective one was needed. This concept is well represented in Australian case law where there is greater emphasis of conscience within equity. In the case of Tanwar, when assessing \"unconsciousable conduct’, the court determined that it ‘encourages false notions’, and it is an ‘equitable defence’. Therefore, conscience must demonstrate liability; it is a ‘baseline to judge behaviour’. Similarly, in Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row, conscience was referred to as an ‘objective value judgement’. This suggests conscience as an objective criterion to judge behaviour. Though Birks states that conscience is unspecific, conflicting case law argues quite the opposite; it is appropriate to assume conscience as this baseline in which actions of unreasonable nature are assessed correctly.  <nl><nl>Nonetheless, conscience gives excessive discretionary power to judges. For judges to assume subjective perspectives on a case-by-case basis undermines the integrity of the judiciary and the concept of equity. Within law, certainty is imperative, and an objective conscience allows the law to be better respected and clearly defined. This perceived subjectivity and arbitrariness has existed for many years with post-medieval judgements slowly fading the true definition of conscience.  Therefore, with its endless interpretations, it remains unsurprising that uncertainty remains. Regardless, though it appears that centrality of conscience has been reaffirmed in modern times, equity still lacks clarity within the courts. It was held in Harris v Williams-Wynne, that where a property covenant was breached, the test the courts took in determining whether the act was unconscionable would be for the claimant to enforce their rights at the date of breach. In these instances, judges focus on the facts of ‘each individual case’. Consequently, this language directly conflicts with the ‘value of certainty in commercial life’. Though he does not explicitly agree with Birks, Turner states that there is a severe ‘lack of judicial guidance’. But Hudson disagrees in that conscience is ‘deeply misunderstood’. Though these two scholars present contrasting perspectives to that of Birks, they also conflict with each other; it can be said that conscience is a curious concept that brings forth debates.  Opposing views give rise to further discretion, possibly damaging the overall meaning of conscience.  <nl><nl>Conscience &amp; trusts<nl>In the case of resulting trusts, Lord Browne presents an argument in Westdeutsche asserting that equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends on the conscience of those who’s legal interest is being affected. One cannot be considered a trustee if he was unaware of the facts that affect his conscience; unaware to hold the property for others in the case of a constructive or implied trust where it would directly influence his conscience. This poses great problems. For the enforcement of proprietary trusts to depend on the conscience of the legal interest being affected’ seems flawed, it greatly affects the law relating to the creation of these interests and confusion is bound to occur. Though he states that an equitable interest, once created will be enforceable against a holder of the property ‘without notice’, it is confusing to align this with his comments where enforceability depends on the conscience of the holder. There is a distinguishing feature here; it does not make sense to assume that conscience of the recipient should be affected ‘but for’ this lack of notice: that it gives rise to a resulting trust. The creation of such interests influence other factors, namely risks and insurance; Birks states that this cannot be left to vague measures of conscience. Therefore, this confusion is ‘intolerable’. The need for conscience to be integrated with common law concepts seems more effective in order to reduce the judicial discretion it so freely provides. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Overall, scholars propose alternative meanings which do provide relief to some extent, but the definition remains confusing. Nonetheless, intuitive decision making cannot mould itself into modern society with Birks himself stating conscience can never be ‘perfectly autonomous’.

Hi Jordon, I hope you’re keeping well too thanks for asking. I’m just preparing for these online exams at the minute and keeping myself busy in such a stressful time. If I have any questions regarding the assessments I’ll be sure to contact you otherwise I am doing well and managing. Best wishes, .. Hi Pippy, I’ve actually opted out of a placement year and discussed this in depth a couple months ago with my programme leader and my course has been changed from four years to three. I just wanted to inform you that that is my current situation and hence why there has been no placement search update. Best wishes, .. Hi Arne, As my exams are fast approaching I don’t think I have a suitable time to discuss my reasons so I will explain it in the email as follows: So in my first year of university during the summer I had actually worked three days a week in a business_descr during the summer and carried it on up until the second year of my degree. However, I did continue to attend 1-2 days a week even after this alongside attending universityand took on a range of topic roles and archiving files and helping the job_title in his daily work. I also had the opportunity to be supervised whilst conducting a meeting with a client that I had completed some work with. I had gotten to experience various topic sectors that the business_descr specialised in which was extremely beneficial. By attending the business_descr for a large amount of time, I feel that i have gained some topic knowledge about what how a business_descr is run and how it works and the knowledge I learnt I had applied into my degree such as time management etc... I did look at the benefits of the placement but this whole experience almost felt like a placement to me and I didn’t feel like it was the right route for me to take in this particular point in my life. After speaking to my personal tutor about this and the programme leader, I didn’t feel like it was in my best interests to pursue a placement. In my final year, I want to be able to use these skills as efficiently as possible and hope to obtain a job_title as a result which is my next key focus. I hope I’ve explained my situation well.

Habituation paradigms have been used to examine this implication, using very young infants to investigate distinctions between biological and non-biological motions. Research (Bertenthal et al., 1987) (Simion, Regolin, &amp; Bulf, 2008) has demonstrated young infants’ sensitivity and ability to distinguish between the two motions, therefore suggesting an innate predisposition for this ability, and have highlighted how this distinction is made before language acquisition. Therefore, supporting Mandler’s third claim, whilst also providing supporting evidence for Mandler’s first claim; that distinctions are made animals vs non-animals. The convergence of evidence supports the validity of the conclusions made.  However, such research can be criticised in respects to the validity of the methodology.

When investigating the categorical organisation of the semantic system, habituation paradigms fail to answer at what point this process begins, which challenges Mandler’s third claim, consequently presenting an argument that categorical organisation does not begin as early as Mandler perhaps suggests. Therefore, we can ask, at what point does this early category organisation begin.<nl><nl>To examine this, we must look at Mandler’s second claim; the system is organised hierarchically. There is much debate regarding which depiction of early category organisations is more accurate. There are two main hypothesises which debate the hierarchical organisation.<nl>Rosch (1978) argues a basic-level hypothesis, and suggests we learn concepts in a bottom-up order. The basic-level is the first conceptual level, it focuses on within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Later in development, the superordinate-level emerges and following that, the subordinate-level. The basic-level occupies a privileged position in the hierarchy in semantic cognition (Rosch, 1978), (Bauer &amp; Just, 2017). Supporting experimental research (Daehler, Lonardo &amp; Bukatko 1979) has found infants made basic-level matches more easily than superordinate ones, and case study research (Clark, 1973) has found children’s first words for objects are often basic-level. The triangulation of methods used across the research supporting the basic-level hypothesis suggests consistency across findings and validates their conclusions. That said, this theory cannot explain the linguistic biases children may be influenced by; when adults label stimuli for children, it is often at the basic-level i.e. adults are more likely use the label ‘bed’ rather than furniture (superordinate-level) or sofa bed (subordinate). This infers that such organisation is possibly guided through linguistic influences and not through bottom up processing as thought.<nl>On the contrary, Mandler has provided an alternative depiction of early category taxonomies; the global-conceptions hypothesis. Using a top-down approach, claims an infant’s first conceptual categories are not at the basic-level, but at a global level which resemble superordinate domains, however there are no basic-level classes within them. Supported through her experimental research using object examination tasks (Mandler &amp; MacDonough 1993), it was found superordinate distinctions were made (animals vs vehicles) in young infants but basic-level contrasts were not (dog vs fish). A criticism regarding the validity of this research is made by Jones &amp; Smith (1993) who argue for the importance of perceptually rich stimuli to be used in concept developmental studies. Real dogs and real fish obtain different features to that of a toy version, i.e. smells, textures and sizes. This research lacks mundane realism. Therefore, assuming the distinctions cannot be made between the basic-level contrast is arguably invalid. It is also important to state how negative results for a basic-level hypothesis does not create positive results for the global-conceptions hypothesis.<nl>Reflecting upon the research presented, there is no clear answer to which hypothesis is correct; both present insightful explanations into early categorical organisation and adult cognitive functioning.

An important factor of this research is challenging prototypicality of categories, and the influences it has upon children in their conceptual development when organising.

      "raw_text": "Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016).<nl><nl>A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of  interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012).  Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. <nl>A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee’s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation.<nl><nl>Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto &amp; Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing.<nl>However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential.<nl>Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them. <nl>An example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). As well as the 4 main stages of the interview – mental reinstatement of context, reporting from a different perspective, reverse order reporting and in-depth reporting – the interview, more importantly, involves an introduction and a ‘transfer control’ phase (Geiselman and Fisher, 2014). During the introduction, the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions, attempting to build rapport. In the ‘transfer control’ phase, the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves. These two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 2010), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase. These satisfaction levels, in turn, are linked to reduced levels of PTSD type symptoms (Kunst et al., 2013) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events, such as sexual assault. <nl><nl>While the Cognitive Interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (Gwyer and Clifford, 1997), there are problems with its practical application. One problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus, cannot conduct the full interview (Kebbell et al., 1999). Another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992; Kebbell et al, 1999). <nl>Therefore, with these limitations in mind, Heydon and Powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training, as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques, known as written-response interview protocol (WRIP). This approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview. An example of a WRIP approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time – whenever they feel ready – with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall. This written format can then be followed up with a formal interview. In terms of anonymous reporting, a WRIP that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the Cognitive Interview techniques. For instance, a WRIP for confidential reporting must begin with an ‘Engage and Explain’ phase that includes the Cognitive Interview’s ‘report everything’ phase. While still remaining anonymous, it is important to still engage with the interviewee, to show sensitivity to them. Thus, it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims. <nl><nl>With the WRIP approach, many of the Cognitive Interview limitations are addressed. By allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime, the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face-to-face interview phase, reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview. Furthermore, by incorporating these two techniques together, the victims’ satisfaction levels, rapport building, and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised, rather they are further encouraged. However, it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations. Nevertheless, theoretically, this collaboration appears to be the ‘Golden Standard’ and ‘fool-proof’ in the context of investigative interviewing. Therefore, with such considerations in mind, the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>In conclusion, interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky. Regardless of age, gender, size, etc. reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual. It is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them. Nevertheless, it is the legal justice system’s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward. It is the police’s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime. Considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward, this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice. Both of these recommendations have a key thing in common – building rapport. Thus, it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing, building rapport is the most important aspect.",
      "fixed_text": "Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016). A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee’s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation. Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto and Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing. However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential. Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims. Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them.

Best wishes, . I was going to answer that in reply to the long email you sent me but it is convenient that you’ve asked. So back in Y11 as part of work experience I spent a week at school in Chicago as job_title and that involved being with kids ranging from Y7-11. In my secondary I was a student mentor for kids in the lower years. And I’ve done some support work for local Church organising events and our yearly community day event. So, that did involve constantly being around children and families. Hope that helps, . Yeah it is. It’s when I had my organisation induction I had to get a DBS done. Is that the same thing as having one done for the organisation or am I just being a bit blonde here. Thanks, . Hi Una, I have a copy of my CV and a enhanced DBS.

      "raw_text": "Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee’s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>",

Disadvantages: • You will be unemployed after your notice period. • Stressful finding another job. Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC. Advantages: • You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. • You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour. • Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity. Disadvantages: • Same as Option 4. • There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice.

However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. Basic Award Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. Compensatory Award The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job. If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this. The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. Additional information Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract. Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. Yours Sincerely,"

      "raw_text": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs £157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a café. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a café to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Café Kluuvikatu 3, café which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.",

The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (µV) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac’s ‘Integrate’ feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. <nl><nl>Descriptive &amp; inferential statistics<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi² test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi² = 12.500, df = 1, p &lt; .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. <nl><nl>To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. These results were expected as brain rhythms differ when eyes are open or closed (Barry et al., 2007).<nl><nl>Reflection<nl>I have achieved a general understanding of physiological measurement using Biopac from conducting this study, as I have learnt how to use the system to rectify and integrate data in order for it to be more understandable to analyse. As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn’t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn’t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant’s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn’t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis.

The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (µV) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac’s ‘Integrate’ feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics Table 1. Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi² test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi² = 12.500, df = 1, p < .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. These results were expected as brain rhythms differ when eyes are open or closed (Barry et al., 2007). Reflection I have achieved a general understanding of physiological measurement using Biopac from conducting this study, as I have learnt how to use the system to rectify and integrate data in order for it to be more understandable to analyse. As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn’t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn’t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant’s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn’t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis. Additionally, I would have ensured the experiment took part in a quiet room away from other people as it is more likely for the brainwave activity to be due to whether the participant’s eyes were open or closed rather than distractions.<nl>"

This can be supported in Ferreira ‘a person is not being deprived of their liberty where they are receiving treatment and are physically restricted by their physical infirmities’. Furthermore, Hayden J stated that ‘habeas corpus applies only to individuals unlawfully detained or whose civil liberties have been compromised in some way’, therefore the application was ‘entirely misconceived’ as not applicable to Alfie.

      "raw_text": "The case, Smith, was heard in the Courts Martial Appeal Court on 25th March 1959. The defendant, a private soldier named Thomas Joseph Smith, stabbed three of his comrades during a fight, with a bayonet in the army regiment barracks. One individual had two bayonet wounds which ‘pierced a lung and caused a haemorrhage’. On his way to the medical reception, the victim was dropped twice. Moreover, he then received incorrect medical treatment, and was negligently treated by the medical staff who failed to diagnose the puncture. The victim died, leading the defendant to be convicted with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, in relevance to s.1 Offences Against the Person Act 1861. <nl>The regimental sergeant-major ‘put his company on parade’ after the fight, detaining them until someone confessed. Smith, as a result, admitted to the stabbing at the parade. The following day, Smith was visited by a sergeant from the Special Investigations Branch who administered a caution and requested for a written admission. Both statements were given as evidence at the trial. <nl>The issue lies in the argument of who is liable for the death of the victim, whether it was due to the negligence of the doctor or the defendant’s actions of stabbing the victim in the army barracks. The relevant law for murder is actus reus, which is unlawful killing, and mens rea, which is the intention to kill or cause GBH. The defendant satisfies both, as his act of stabbing the victim led to the consequence of his death (results crime). Smith also had indirect intention, as he may not have wished for the given outcome, but it was virtually certain to occur because of his actions. It can be said that he committed voluntary conduct of actus reus as he did have control over his actions. This can be supported by Lord Denning’s statement, ‘the requirement that it should be a voluntary act is essential, not only in a murder case, but also in every criminal case as no act is punishable if it is done involuntarily’ in Bratty.<nl>The defendant claimed the soldier did not instantly die, it was rather the injuries encountered on his journey to receive medical attention, and the doctor mistreating him which caused his death. The doctor had a duty of care to attend to the necessary needs of the patient, which did not occur as he was given artificial respiration after a failure of saline solution transfusion, which arguably contributed to his death as ‘the treatment that he was given was thoroughly bad’. The duty of care ‘was breached, and as a direct result of the breach, the patient suffered harm’. This is supported by Dr. Camps, who provided evidence for the defence and stated the victim’s chances of improvement were ‘as high as 75 per cent’. <nl>Furthermore, the defendant appealed that the alleged confessions were wrongly admitted as evidence. Represented by Roderic Bowen QC and H.K Woolf, it was argued on his behalf that the ‘first admission was inadmissible’ primarily due to the proceedings being soiled from the threat posed by the sergeant-major. Arguably, this was conceded further in the second admission made as the order persisted, therefore the fear of threat concludes the confession to be involuntary. It was reminded to the court that the relationship between the individuals must be considered as the young soldier is obliged to follow the orders of his major, so he had to obey the orders given. <nl>The Crown, represented by E. Garth Moore, stated that the threats posed ‘were not directed to the accused alone, but to a whole company’ so the first admission can be addressed as admissible. It was explained that the sanction was so trivial that it would be ‘almost an abuse of language to call it a threat’. The s.36(1) Medical Act 1983 states if a fully registered person is judged by the Professional Conduct Committee to have been guilty of serious professional misconduct while registered or not, the Committee may direct that his name shall be erased from the register, which the medical staff are faced with in this case. With such a severe consequence, it can be argued that the medical staff ensured they were accurate in their actions to uphold professional conduct. Furthermore, the action of the third party involved, the medical staff, performed a reasonable response to the defendant’s original act. Despite reducing chances of recovery, it is argued that their act did not break the chain of causation because it was not ‘free, voluntary and informed’, as said in Pagett. <nl>In Cheshire, the defendant ‘shot the victim in the thigh and stomach, the wounds necessitated surgery from which he developed breathing difficulties’, for which he had to have tracheotomy. Due to rare complications in surgery, the victim died. Although, the ‘complication was a direct consequence of the appellant’s acts which remained a significant cause’ to the death of the victim, it was concluded, using precedents from the case of R v Smith, that there was no break in the chain of causation. The judge told the jury that if they find the chain of causation to be broken, they must believe that ‘the medical treatment or lack of it was reckless in the sense that those administering it were careless of the consequences’. It was concluded that the defendant’s actions were still an operating and substantial cause of the victim’s death, therefore the appeal was dismissed. This differs to Jordan where the victim was given antibiotics to deal with stab wounds, however he had an allergic reaction due to the doctor’s misconduct of not thoroughly checking records, and he died. The court, in this case, concluded that the defendant’s actions did satisfy novus actus interviens, so the chain of causation was broken. Byrne J, stated that the death was not ‘consequent upon the wound inflicted’, but for the actions of the defendant. <nl>In the present case, the court concluded the encountered negligence received does not break the chain of causation, and it is the fault of the defendant for the victim’s death. Lord Parker CJ, one of the three judges of the case, stated that the action undertaken by the sergeant-major was appropriate. While what was said by the regimental sergeant-major was a threat, it assisted to provide further information for inquiries to be made. He stated that an individual’s confession beyond the court is solely admissible if voluntary, therefore Smith’s first admission cannot be acceptable. On the other hand, the second statement is admissible as ‘it is clear that the effect of any original inducement or threat under which the first statement was made had been dissipated’. Furthermore, when the second confession was made, the circumstances were different such as the passing of nine hours, the parade had ended, and the threat was spent. The change in circumstances alters the validity of the admissions therefore it is acceptable for the second confession to be addressed as admissible. <nl>According to Lord Parker CJ, ‘if at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause of death is also operating’. It could not be due to the medical negligence faced, as ‘an original wounding is the only reason that treatment and presence in a hospital would be required’. Based on this, it can be disputed that despite the series of unfortunate events after the stabbing, the death only occurred due to the original stabbing from Smith, so the ‘wound was still an operating cause and a substantial cause of death’. The victim would not be in hospital but for the stabbing, so it would be reasonable to conclude that the stabbing was the reason for his death, satisfying factual causation. This principle upheld the conviction, and the court dismissed the appeal.",

It was concluded that the defendant’s actions were still an operating and substantial cause of the victim’s death, therefore the appeal was dismissed. This differs to Jordan where the victim was given antibiotics to deal with stab wounds, however he had an allergic reaction due to the doctor’s misconduct of not thoroughly checking records, and he died. The court, in this case, concluded that the defendant’s actions did satisfy novus actus interviens, so the chain of causation was broken. Byrne J, stated that the death was not ‘consequent upon the wound inflicted’, but for the actions of the defendant. In the present case, the court concluded the encountered negligence received does not break the chain of causation, and it is the fault of the defendant for the victim’s death. Lord Parker CJ, one of the three judges of the case, stated that the action undertaken by the sergeant-major was appropriate. While what was said by the regimental sergeant-major was a threat, it assisted to provide further information for inquiries to be made. He stated that an individual’s confession beyond the court is solely admissible if voluntary, therefore Smith’s first admission cannot be acceptable. On the other hand, the second statement is admissible as ‘it is clear that the effect of any original inducement or threat under which the first statement was made had been dissipated’. Furthermore, when the second confession was made, the circumstances were different such as the passing of nine hours, the parade had ended, and the threat was spent. The change in circumstances alters the validity of the admissions therefore it is acceptable for the second confession to be addressed as admissible. According to Lord Parker CJ, ‘if at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause of death is also operating’. It could not be due to the medical negligence faced, as ‘an original wounding is the only reason that treatment and presence in a hospital would be required’. Based on this, it can be disputed that despite the series of unfortunate events after the stabbing, the death only occurred due to the original stabbing from Smith, so the ‘wound was still an operating cause and a substantial cause of death’. The victim would not be in hospital but for the stabbing, so it would be reasonable to conclude that the stabbing was the reason for his death, satisfying factual causation. This principle upheld the conviction, and the court dismissed the appeal."

      "raw_text": "1.Outline the proposed role of dopamine in the maintenance of drug use<nl>Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward, eating, drinking and sex are examples of reward process that stimulate dopamine production. In evolutionary terms dopamine naturally encourages behaviour that is vital to live such as eating when one is hungry. The nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area are important areas in the brain associated with production of dopamine(Lecture notes). Drugs cause a rush or high- pleasurable feelings and this results in associating the drugs with the feeling. In terms of maintenance of drug use,when drugs such as cocaine are used, dopamine levels are intense and even after use dopamine levels are still high causing one to have almost a greater feeling of ‘pleasure’ leading to intense cravings and intense. This is in comparison to the levels of dopamine produced in natural activities such as eating, after eating one is basically satisfied and the dopamine levels decrease. Dopamine levels being high leads to continued use of the drug to get the ‘high’. Additionally, it's common in long term drug users that the number of dopamine receptors decrease leading to depressive feelings.(Heshmati et al, 2015). These depressive feelings would lead to increased use of the drug to achieve the pleasurable feelings, this is a cycle and the drug use is maintained. <nl><nl>2.Outline the potential role of epigenetics in explaining familial transmission of phobias<nl>Epigenetics is defined as the change in the phenotype but the genetic code stays the same. Genes are turned off or on causing changes which are heritable, this is a result of external factors eg the environment and experiences.(Hamilton J, P: Epigenetics 2011)  A study on mice who were placed in a skinner box and electrocuted showed the familial transmission of phobias, these mice were electrocuted when placed in the skinner box, as a result they formed a phobia of being placed in a skinner box, associating the electrocution (pain) with the box. The mice then produced offspring, which were placed into the skinner box without electrocution but showed a fear response. Epigenetics is the only answer as these mice had never been electrocuted and there was no reason for them to associate pain with the skinner box. Evolutionary studies have also suggested that we are born with snake and spider phobias as our ancestors were less likely to notice them, as they are small and discreet but still harmful. Our ancestors had to be more aware of them whereas lions and bears are easy to spot.(Russell et al, 2015)<nl><nl>3.<nl>Critically evaluate the evidence that schizophrenia is caused by excess dopamine in the brain<nl>The original dopamine hypothesis stated that schizophrenia was a result of excess dopamine. Evidence to support this includes the amphetamine psychosis, which is a result of taking amphetamines.(Jørgen G et al, 2012)The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis mirror symptoms of schizophrenia. The use of amphetamines also increases the amount of dopamine in the brain so for researchers this was a direct link to schizophrenia.Also, researchers found that by giving schizophrenia sufferers small doses of dopamine their symptoms worsened. The dopamine hypothesis however is biologically reductionist, there have been studies showing that there are other factors such as the environment to schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis attempts to explain schizophrenia just in terms of biology, it simplifies and generalises when the condition is much more than biology and this can be shown in the diathesis stress model. Another weakness of the dopamine hypothesis to explain schizophrenia is the correlation is not equal causation issue. There isn't sufficient evidence to show whether schizophrenia causes high dopamine levels or high dopamine levels cause schizophrenia.<nl><nl>Outline three different brain research techniques and mention one strength and one weakness for each.<nl> Fmri- functional magnetic resonance imaging. A type of imaging technique that measures blood flow in parts of the brain when participants are asked to perform tasks. One strength of this technique is that it has high spatial resolution meaning it is able to show  part exactly of the brain exactly where the blood is being used to perform tasks. FMRI tracks blood flow, as blood flow shows that a particular part of the brain is using oxygen. A weakness of this technique is that it has poor temporal resolution, brain activity can not be tracked accurately, there is a time delay of 4 to 6 seconds, this is because an FMRI scan is not able to quickly track the change in blood flow. EEG- electroencephalography is a technique where electrodes are used to measure neural activity in the brain. Temporal resolution for this technique is excellent and you can see directly the neural activity in the brain, however a weakness for EEG would be the fact it doesn't tell us anything about brain structures and the dynamics of the brain it just shows electrical potential in the brain. (Sturzbecher M.J., de Araujo D.B. (2012))The third research technique is MEG- Magnetoencephalography, it measures the magnetic field that are produced in the brain, this technique is much better in comparison to EEG in terms of spatial resolution, parts of the brain can be localised well however a massive issue is the fact that this technique is expensive and not economic that's why it is so rare.<nl><nl>2.Describe the stress response, with reference to both the neural and hormonal components<nl>The stress response is also called the fight or flight response, this is the body’s biological process to stress. This is triggered by something that could cause harm and our body is deciding to literally fight or flight, this is in order to survive.When the threat is recognised, the hypothalamus triggers the autonomous nervous system,which is rapid, and the endocrine system which is a bit slower in action. The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland which causes release of ACTH hormone, this hormone then causes the release of cortisol which is known as the stress hormone. The autonomous nervous system on the other hand works more rapidly and it causes the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline and noradrenaline and other stress hormones.(Goldstein 2010) These hormones are both useful in the state of stress for an organism. The 2 hormones increase heart rate and breathing, this is also to help with running or escaping the threat. Other physical changes happen as a result of this,pupils are dilated, rectum is contracted, there is also more blood flow to areas of the body which would be in more need such as the brain and less blood to places such as the digestive system. <nl><nl>Give an example and brief explanation of three neurodevelopmental disorders: one caused mainly by genetic factors, one mainly caused by environmental factors and one that demonstrates gene-environment interactions.<nl> Down Syndrome is mainly caused by genetic factors.

      "raw_text": "Employment relations is a process of socio-economic exchange, and involves a individual performing service or duty in exchange for payment. Employment relations looks at the different aspects of a relationship between an employee and its employer.  Employment relations have a major impact on the UK labour market, this statement is supported by ONS report on the UK labour market which shows from November 2017, there are approximately 32 million people at work with more than half being employed.<nl>The UK government is crucial with regards to employment relations to ensure they are able to meet the key goals of the country. The government acts as the economic manager, this consist of setting the level of wages, tax rate and managing the cost of living.  The government are also classed as regulators of labour markets, this involves initiating new laws and regulations that have an impact upon the relationship between employer and employee. In addition, they play act as the welfare state, ensuring they are able to aid those who have been made redundant or struggling with financial difficulties. Being the largest employer with 5.39 million workers employed, the government sees itself as a eloquent employer and wants to show private sectors how to do this. <nl>This report will look the role the government plays with regards to gender equality in the UK. There has been an improvement in the amount of females in the labour market. Since the beginning, there has always been more men employed them women. The office of national statistics shows during the third quarter of 2020, 78.6% of men were employed opposed to the 71.9% of women who have been employed, a difference of just under 7%, this is near enough the lowest the difference has ever been and is a huge improvement considering the gap was 11.5% ten years ago. These numbers have however been affected heavily by the covid-19 pandemic. The employment rates of males has remained around 70%, however females have increased immensely. Since the great recession in 2008 in which women employment was roughly 67%, women employment has increased by around 5%.  ONS suggests that women employment was at an all time high in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic of 72.6%, showing a positive change from 52.8% in 1971. The changes in state pension age for women has had a slight impact on this increase meaning less females retiring between the ages of 60-65. This increase in the number of women in the labour market has initiated a positive attitude towards the support of gender equality. There are several reasons for the growth in numbers of females in the workforce, one huge reason is the government acting as regulators of labour markets and initiating laws, these laws include the lone parent income support and equality act 2010, equality and human right commission, employment act 2008 and equality act 2006. From the start of 2008 to 2010, male employment rate went down by 4%, whereas for females just under 2% due to so many being made redundant. The years following the UK recession saw a loss in numbers of female full time workers, but an improvement in the number of part time employees. Fortunately, since the end of 2012 the full time employment has grown. During recession, many organisations recruited part time workers and full time workers were made redundant to help with labour costs and still have the same productivity from employees. This process is referred to as labour market flexibility, (Bell and Blanchflower, 2010). And is a process that the state were supportive of to help get the labour market back to the equilibrium, and was beneficial for part time employees.  To have a greater effect, the UK government should have implemented a different strategy in order to support all those affected with the great recession. <nl><nl>Despite many efforts for many years, gender equality is still a major and worldwide issue within the workplace. The global gender gap report 2020 stated there are \"massive inequalities in almost all of the UK’s fasted-growing job clusters of the future\", this is a worrying stat as in order to sustain an effective workforce in the future, it is crucial that women are able to access resources that would aid the upbringing of children, inevitably the future labour market. Improvement in gender equality in the workplace with regards to the opportunities available, would allow women to contribute and support the UK economy. A study conducted by PwC (2020), suggests \"steps have been made towards advancing gender equality, however progress is slow\". This statement comes from results showing that the UK’s position remaining at 16th however still doing better than OECD average.  Another major and insightful fact from this study reports that if the UK were able to achieve the same level of female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by a staggering $252 billion. This supports the importance of allowing women the same opportunities and resources as men and pushing the gender equality agenda, because of the great impact it could have on the UK economy.  An article written by the guardian states, \"the UK has fallen from 15th to 21st\" with regards to being the most equal nation. Although there has been progress in the number of women in the labour market, the UK are still far below its European neighbours with the gender equality rankings and shows that gender inequality is still of a major concern. <nl>Another major dilemma within the workforce is gender pay gap which supports the gender inequality regime. 8,424 private sector employers reported their data, with 3,746 employers noticing their pay gap improve whilst 3,387 seeing pay gap worsen, and 645 employers seeing no change. This supports that the statement that gender equality is still an issue. However, with regards to part-time employees women on average earn more, a possible reason for females earning more in part time field is it gives them flexibility to complete other commitments meaning more women doing part-time and higher earnings.  The state of UK has played its role with the improvement in the gender pay gap with the policies and laws that have been legislated. Companies with more than 50 employees are now required to execute an equal pay audit, this identifies any differences in pay between men and women doing equal work. As an employer, doing an audit shows your dedication to remove any unfair pay.   This comes as a part of the equal pay act 2010, which came into force to give both men and women a right to equal pay for equal work and has been implemented to protect people from discrimination. In 2017, it was compulsory for any company with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap report, this comes as change as originally companies could publish this voluntarily.  A negative to this law is that it is only compulsory for companies to report, however not actually make amendments to the pay gap. Since the beginning of gender pay gap being analysed, this issue has still not been resolved and could still be a problem for the foreseeable future, this comes as a result of the lack of determination from the UK government to resolve this issue. <nl><nl>To help minimise gender pay gap and to resolve the issue of pay inequality, national minimum wage was enacted as a plan. This is significant as this was the UK governments’ first national and cross-sectural attempt to regulate low pay. Dube (2017) found that in America for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, over the long run, the poverty rate is expected to decline by 5.3 percent, this emphasises the importance of minimum wage.   In 2016, national living wage was implemented to help and support females in the workforce, however with the increase of the minimum national living wage by 4.9% in 2019, nearly 3 million children are still in poverty with parents who are at work. This proves that it is still of a major concern. Women make up 60% of workers on the national living wage, meaning at least one third of females are not on a wage that they could live on. The Fawcett society also mentioned that increasing the minimum wage to the real living wage, would help in resolving the gender pay gap issue.<nl><nl>With regards to public sector, the government are doing there best to set an example to private sector companies, this is evident as an article from the public finance states that based on the number of employees in the senior government roles, UK is top in the EU and only fourth in the G20 nations. Presently, the gender pay gap amongst all employees in the public sector is 15.5%, which is a slight improvement, as in the last decade the gap has increased by roughly 4%. The most recent data conducted by ONS was in 2018, and suggests there has been an increase of 10.9 percentage points from 31 march 2008 to 31 march 2018 which at that point was 42.7% of female employees working at senior civil service level. This is a positive sign and shows gradual improvement year by year. In the executive officer and administrate responsibility levels, there are more females then male employees. Females still dominate with the number of civil service employees, however decreased by 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 which is not a positive sign. To prevent gender inequality occurring within the public sector, the government have enacted public sector equality duty. PSED \"requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity\" (Fredman, 2011).and ensure good relations between employees. This act requires public authorities to published quality objectives every four years as a minimum, also information to show they are cooperating with the public sector equality duty.  PSED has yet to accomplish the goals it was set out to perform, as gender inequality is still present within the public sector.  ONS shows that gender pay gap still exists amongst all of the professions within the public sector, showing more still needs to be done to resolve gender inequality. This affects the government’s stance as aiming to be a role model, and portrays a negative image for the private sector employers. <nl><nl>The UK government has attempted to find the perfect solution for gender inequality and has done this through various techniques including creating new laws to tackle the issues. There are still many issues occurring presently such as , gender pay gap, the number of females in the higher positions in contrast to males, the significant amount of women who are not on a wage that they could live on. One major law that was implemented by the government which was crucial was the Equality act 2010, this was a good intervention is helping with equality, however both males and females being represented equally still seems to be on concern.  Equal pay has gradually been improving, however still seems a long way from the end goal, a solution to this could be a stricter approach towards companies like setting deadlines, ensuring equal pay becomes a priority for companies. To help with the millions of females who struggle to earn a wage to live on, the government should make this a priority by encouraging organisations to pay the real living wage and to make it mandatory. The national minimum wage is a positive for low pay workers (which is dominated by females), however there are still millions who earn less than the real living wage. Therefore the government need to implement new strategies to tackle this.  The positions of more authority within organisations still have majority of men as the employees, the government should encourage females to apply for these higher positions by showing other women who have been able to become employees of these top positions, this could be used as motivation for females to feel that they are also able to achieve these roles. It is vital that the skills and potential of women in the UK are used to a maximum, as mentioned previously if the UK were able to reach the same female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by $252 billion, which would help decrease the gender pay gap and boost the economy significantly. This shows if the UK government are able to fulfil their roles efficiently as the biggest employers, and regulators of labour market, they could definitely help with gender inequality in the UK",

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl>Reasoning has two explanations which have differences and similarities between them. Firstly, inductive reasoning is a process where a subject has a specific argument meaning the argument is related to true facts whereas within an inductively valid argument the conclusion is general (General Books, 2013). Therefore, the conclusion and overall argument is logically true however it may or may not be realistically true. For example, it could be said that \"all strawberries are a fruit\" (specific statement), another statement could be \"the bag is full of fruits\", (specific statement), which for inductive reasoning would lead to a general conclusion, being \"the bag is full of strawberries.\" This conclusion may or not be true as we are unsure of the contents in the bag and it could include other fruits such as grapes or apples etc. <nl>On the other hand, deductive reasoning has a different approach to arguments where instead of having a specific argument leading to a general conclusion, the subject has a general argument which isn’t really specific to the end conclusion however within the deductively valid argument the conclusion is specific, therefore it is both logically and realistically true (Jonathon and Evans, 2013). An example of this is if there was a general statement such as \"all strawberries are fruits\" and another general statement such as \"all fruits have seeds\" then the specific conclusion would be \"strawberries have seeds\". This conclusion is logically and realistically true. <nl>Furthermore, another difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is deductive reasoning problems can be resolved without real world knowledge. This is because it is argued that deduction is more likely to be deliberate and involved with rule-based practises compared to induction which is more influenced by context, which suggest that there are two alternative and distinct forms of reasoning (General Books, 2013). <nl><question2><nl>In 1996 ‘Wasons Selection task’ was developed which was based on the ruling \"if P then Q\" - if P is true then so is Q. For example, participants will be shown four cards I, K, 4,7 and be told the rule \"if a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other side.\" Participants would then be asked to turn over the minimum number of cards they think would be sufficient enough to prove the rule. However, most participants struggle with this task as they may overlook a card that could falsify the rule (Eysenck, 2004).<nl>This is because the participants have insight into the logical structure of the problem. This is based on the insight model developed in 1972 which suggested that the chances of being successful on a task depends on the participants level of insight (Eysenck, 2004). Insight has three levels, the first being no insight therefore participants will choose the cards mentioned in the rule because they think only confirming the rule is priority. In this example the participant would choose the cards \"I\" and \"4\" and could be identified as matching bias. Partial insight is the second level when the participant realises that confirming and falsifying the rule is important, therefore they would turn over \"I\", \"4\" and \"K\", the \"K\" would be falsifying. Full insight is then the highest level of insight and is when the participants will only select cards that falsify the rule, meaning the \"K\" and \"7\" card would be selected. <nl>Furthermore, it could be said that the task is so difficult due to the abstract content that is used on the participants. In conditions where concrete content is used opposed to abstract content, 60% of the participants correctly selected the P card and not the Q card (Manktelow , 1999). <nl><question3><nl>Subjective Expected utility is the theory on how to make optimal decisions. Five main axioms are used as a foundation to the theory which maximizes an individuals expected utility in decisions made. Predictions have been derived from initial axioms in order to test whether the theory can be used from psychological approach (Chavas, 2004). <nl>Transivity is the first principle where if A is preferred to B and B to C then A should be preferred to C. Nevertheless, in 1969 Tversky suggested that if decisions are complex, order preference becomes intransitive as individuals can only focus on one attribute in decision making. Invariance is the second where A is preferred to B or B to A therefore choice preference shouldn’t impact their description. However, research has proved that if they are presented with two versions of a problem its more likely that there’s a preference for A to be in version one but B to A in version two. Independence is the third principle where if A is preferred to B, it shouldn’t depend on anything the choices have in common.

      "fixed_text": "Reasoning has two explanations which have differences and similarities between them. Firstly, inductive reasoning is a process where a subject has a specific argument meaning the argument is related to true facts whereas within an inductively valid argument the conclusion is general (General Books, 2013). Therefore, the conclusion and overall argument is logically true however it may or may not be realistically true. For example, it could be said that \"all strawberries are a fruit\" (specific statement), another statement could be \"the bag is full of fruits\", (specific statement), which for inductive reasoning would lead to a general conclusion, being \"the bag is full of strawberries.\" This conclusion may or not be true as we are unsure of the contents in the bag and it could include other fruits such as grapes or apples etc. On the other hand, deductive reasoning has a different approach to arguments where instead of having a specific argument leading to a general conclusion, the subject has a general argument which isn’t really specific to the end conclusion however within the deductively valid argument the conclusion is specific, therefore it is both logically and realistically true (Jonathon and Evans, 2013). An example of this is if there was a general statement such as \"all strawberries are fruits\" and another general statement such as \"all fruits have seeds\" then the specific conclusion would be \"strawberries have seeds\". This conclusion is logically and realistically true. Furthermore, another difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is deductive reasoning problems can be resolved without real world knowledge. This is because it is argued that deduction is more likely to be deliberate and involved with rule-based practises compared to induction which is more influenced by context, which suggest that there are two alternative and distinct forms of reasoning (General Books, 2013). In 1996 ‘Wasons Selection task’ was developed which was based on the ruling \"if P then Q\" - if P is true then so is Q. For example, participants will be shown four cards I, K, 4,7 and be told the rule \"if a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other side.\" Participants would then be asked to turn over the minimum number of cards they think would be sufficient enough to prove the rule. However, most participants struggle with this task as they may overlook a card that could falsify the rule (Eysenck, 2004). This is because the participants have insight into the logical structure of the problem. This is based on the insight model developed in 1972 which suggested that the chances of being successful on a task depends on the participants level of insight (Eysenck, 2004). Insight has three levels, the first being no insight therefore participants will choose the cards mentioned in the rule because they think only confirming the rule is priority. In this example the participant would choose the cards \"I\" and \"4\" and could be identified as matching bias. Partial insight is the second level when the participant realises that confirming and falsifying the rule is important, therefore they would turn over \"I\", \"4\" and \"K\", the \"K\" would be falsifying. Full insight is then the highest level of insight and is when the participants will only select cards that falsify the rule, meaning the \"K\" and \"7\" card would be selected. Furthermore, it could be said that the task is so difficult due to the abstract content that is used on the participants. In conditions where concrete content is used opposed to abstract content, 60% of the participants correctly selected the P card and not the Q card (Manktelow , 1999). Subjective Expected utility is the theory on how to make optimal decisions. Five main axioms are used as a foundation to the theory which maximizes an individuals expected utility in decisions made. Predictions have been derived from initial axioms in order to test whether the theory can be used from psychological approach (Chavas, 2004). Transivity is the first principle where if A is preferred to B and B to C then A should be preferred to C. Nevertheless, in 1969 Tversky suggested that if decisions are complex, order preference becomes intransitive as individuals can only focus on one attribute in decision making. Invariance is the second where A is preferred to B or B to A therefore choice preference shouldn’t impact their description. However, research has proved that if they are presented with two versions of a problem its more likely that there’s a preference for A to be in version one but B to A in version two. Independence is the third principle where if A is preferred to B, it shouldn’t depend on anything the choices have in common. However, the Allais paradox states that when presented with two, individuals will prefer A to B in gamble 1 but B to A in gamble 2. Within the independence principle it states that preferences should not be affected. (Chavas, 2004). In addition, another explanation is the prospect theory which states when it is time for decision making, a person will assess their gains and losses from a decision relative to certain reference points, for example the present situation they are involved in or the way in which a decision is framed. This is done as an alternative to basing decisions on an absolute value. (Chavas, 2004) Problem solving is defined as a goal that is to be reached but an individual is not sure on how to do it.
