      "raw_text": "\"Introduction.<nl>This essay will argue that the hostility shown towards good faith is justified and if anything English law needs to be more hostile to the principle of good faith. This is because the implementation of good faith towards commercial contracts is detrimental to the core principles and values commercial law prides itself upon. The principles which commercial law prides itself upon are: commercial certainty and party autonomy. If good faith is applied to commercial law, it affects both of these principles in some way, shape or form. Therefore, England’s commercial law courts will fall behind its competitors as the implementation of good faith may be detrimental to the highly acclaimed courts. This essay will show how the implementation of good faith will undermine these core principles.<nl>How good faith affects party autonomy.<nl>What is good faith?<nl>Good faith is defined as ‘a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, openness and consideration for the interests of the other party to the transaction or relationship in question’. Good faith can be included in a contract either expressly or it can be implied. If parties agree to deal with good faith and this is included in the final contract it will be enforceable, however it is not always this straight forward. Good faith can also be included through implied terms in a contract. The parties need to fulfil certain criteria to allow good faith to be implied in the contract. These criteria include: there must be no express terms of good faith, high degree of communication and cooperation, long standing commercial relationships, etc. <nl>To further develop this there are two types of implied terms; those implied by fact or those implied by law. ‘Terms implied by fact are those that a court will read into a contract so that it reflects the intention of the parties.’. ‘Terms implied in law are not terms that the parties to an agreement would have agreed to, but rather terms that arise as a legal incident of a particular legal relationship’.<nl><nl>What is party autonomy?<nl>Simply put party autonomy allows the parties, that are contracting with one another, to choose which laws will govern the contract between them. This in essence allows ‘commercial men to do business in the way they want to do it’ which was said by Lord Devlin.<nl>Party autonomy then gives rise to two more legal concepts which are freedom of contract and sanctity of contract. These two principles are used in court to enforce party autonomy. The definition of freedom of contract is ‘The parties are free to agree the terms of the contract that will govern their relationship’. This means that the business men will decide which rules they want to apply in their contract and the court will uphold this. Sanctity of contract is when ‘the courts should give eﬀect to the terms of the contract and should not be quick to invalidate contractual terms freely entered into. Accordingly, the courts will seek to uphold commercial contracts, unless the terms are overly restrictive or oppressive, are in breach of the law, or oﬀend principles of public policy.’. <nl>Party autonomy is extremely important to English commercial law, ‘despite statutory inroads, party autonomy is at the heart of English commercial law’. It can be seen as the heart of English commercial law as it allows business men to contract how they wish, allowing parties to conduct the arbitral process as they desire. Therefore, if good faith limits or alters the application of party autonomy it could be very detrimental to English commercial law. This will be discussed further.<nl>How implied terms of good faith affect party autonomy.<nl>The basis of party autonomy is to allow the contracting parties to decide what governs their contract. If the contracting parties wanted to include aspects of good faith within the contract, then they would have expressly included it within the contract. The implication of allowing implied terms to govern commercial contracts is that the parties no longer have as much control of what governs the contract. The parties include the terms that they see fit to apply to the contract. Therefore, if the court looked at the contract on surrounding circumstances and applied good faith which they did not intend to include into the contract, it would undermine the principle of party autonomy. <nl>The case of Yam Seng Leggat said ‘the relevant background against which contracts are made includes not only matters of fact known to the parties but also shared values and norms of behaviour’. Since the terms are not expressed there is no clarity and so a level of uncertainty exists when interpreting the circumstances surrounding the contracting parties. Since the contracting parties have no control over this, it directly affects party autonomy, ‘the \"\"implied\"\" duty of good faith that would undermine the terms the parties have seen fit to reduce to writing.’. The fact that the contracting parties exclude certain terms of good faith from the contract shows that this would be because they did not come to a proper agreement upon certain terms ‘the very fact that the parties have excluded from the text of the contract some specifications that were discussed during the negotiations indicates that no agreement was reached on those matters.’. Therefore, why should these terms of good faith be included if they could not agree upon them, hence why it would not be included into the contract. So why should the courts then say they implied these principles while drafting the contract and then apply them. If this were true it would have been drafted into the contract originally. Therefore, implied terms of good faith negatively affect party autonomy. <nl>How express terms of good faith affect party autonomy.<nl>On the surface express terms of good faith may seem to enhance party autonomy. This is because if the contracting parties want the law of good faith to apply, they can put it in writing as an express term. If they do this the court will enforce it. In the case of Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras the contracting parties included a promise in the contract to negotiate in good faith. Since they had an express term of good faith within the contract, the courts could enforce the duty of good faith upon the party. Therefore, enhancing party autonomy as the contracting parties wanted the law of good faith to apply to the contract. ‘Party autonomy is enhanced by the Courts recognising and giving effect to the parties pre-contractual intentions’. <nl>However, express terms of good faith can be seen as more detrimental to party autonomy than beneficial. This is because good faith is a very loose term and thus creates uncertainty. ‘with it comes great uncertainty as to scope of the obligation and trying to determine the meaning of such duty, and its interaction with the other terms of the agreement’ the parties may want to include terms of good faith but they may be too vague in order to be enforceable in the contract. Therefore, party autonomy is affected as the desired laws may not be applied. ‘Even when a document…is intended by the parties to be legally binding, there are circumstances in which it may be regarded as too uncertain to be enforceable by a court.’. Also when applying express terms of good faith if they are not explicitly stating what the duty of good faith is it leads to uncertainty. This could lead the courts to interpret good faith in a way that neither party anticipated. Therefore, directly undermining party autonomy. <nl>How does good faith undermine commercial certainty?<nl>What is commercial certainty?<nl>Commercial certainty put simply is the ‘predictability of judicial decisions’. Commercial certainty in English commercial law is a major selling point as it is clear where the contracting parties stand in relation to the law when forming a contract ‘The law must be accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable’. This is because the contracting parties contract off the precedent of past case law. Therefore, the contracting parties can anticipate and be certain of duties, responsibility and liability if needed. Therefore, once a rule has been decided parties will contract based upon this rule, so they will be certain that a similar outcome would occur. <nl>How does good faith affect commercial certainty?<nl>Implied terms of Good faith undermines commercial certainty due to the way in which good faith is applied within the courts. This is because the courts look at the surrounding circumstances such as the relationship between the parties etc. This can lead to uncertainty as the implementation of good faith can be vague and subjective. Good faith is very loosely defined which can lead to varying interpretations as to the meaning of good faith. Therefore the approach to applying good faith will be open to interpretation not giving consistency such as ‘ Is it the role of the courts to prescribe moral standards to which contractors must be judged by? It is subjective, in that ‘good faith’ only requires a clear conscience on behalf of both parties’. The danger is that the implementation and adjudication of good faith will be based upon ‘the basis of intuition, discretion or ad hoc decision-making rather than consistency’. <nl>This means in similar cases different outcomes could be reached, creating uncertainty in commercial law due to the application of good faith. If contracting parties enter a contract looking at precedent from a past case and they apply similar principles of implied good faith, they may not get the same outcome at court. This will cause uncertainty causing business men to contract elsewhere, as commercial certainty is essential to contracting parties. In Vallejo v Wheeler Lord Mansfield said ‘In all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty; and therefore, it is of  more consequence that a rule should be certain, than whether the rule is established one way or the other. Because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon’. Certainty is needed because the contracting parties want contracts to have strict performance so the contract can enforce the ultimate goals and intentions of the parties. Implied terms of good faith directly undermines commercial certainty as the contracting parties would not be sure of the outcome if they included implied terms of good faith into their contract. This shows that good faith is detrimental to commercial certainty, which commercial law prides itself upon. <nl>Conclusion.<nl>The general hostility to good faith as shown is extremely justified.  This is because good faith undermines the core principles of commercial law and will subsequently ruin the reputation of the English commercial courts, resulting in contracting parties to go elsewhere to contract with one another. If anything the English commercial courts could be seen as too lenient with the negative effects good faith is bringing to commercial law. These are not only short term problems with the contracting parties entering into contracts which are not suitable, but good faith is also destroying the core principles which commercial law is rested upon.<nl>Furthermore, party autonomy is not only a core principle of commercial law but also a major selling point to business men. This is because they can take control over their contracts, so they can fulfil the parties best interests without interference. However, good faith significantly reduces the freedom that these parties have. This is because implied terms of good faith may be applied through the courts even though it was neither of the parties intentions. Also with express terms of good faith there is very little clarity making it difficult to understand not only for the contracting parties but also for the courts. Therefore, good faith is attacking the very heart of commercial law.<nl>Finally, commercial certainty is another core principle on which commercial law is based upon. This unpredictability of cases will make contracting parties go to alternative places to proceed with dealings. This is because commercial certainty reassures and allows parties to contract with them knowing their commercial interests would be uninfringed upon. <nl>Therefore, English law has every right to have general hostility towards good faith. It could be argued that English law needs to be more hostile due to the damage good faith is doing towards commercial law.\"",

Then on the point of sub-headings within these 3 main headings do you use sub-headings to set out what you are going to say, so like a question that you proceed to answer? Many thanks. Hi sir, The position I’m taking is 3 reasons as to why topic should be included into topic. The last 3 points are going against it. And then in my conclusion I would analyse give reasons why it should or shouldn’t be included. Thanks. Hi Sir, Thank you very much for all the help. Have a good New Years. Thanks."

      "raw_text": "Over the last few years EMNE’s have become more prominent within the globalised world we now live in. These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the ‘going global era.’ They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A’s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE’s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE’s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There’s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE’s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA – an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie’s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE’s and EMNE’s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE’s have different motivations, which don’t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE’s and EMNE’s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE’s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE’s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It’s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE’s and the newer EMNE’s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE’s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE’s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE’s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE’s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE’s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE’s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE’s are essentially used as ‘guinea pigs.’ With regards to ownership advantages many MNE’s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE’s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A’s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It’s well documented that traditional MNE’s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they’re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don’t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE’S. New EMNE’s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE’s, as they’re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they’re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It’s also believed that if EMNE’s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there’s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE’s versus EMNE’s. It’s believed that EMNE’s are much more adaptable than MNE’s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A’s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn’t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE’s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning’s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE’s can’t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning’s explanation this would mean that they’re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE’s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE’s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE’s don’t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won’t outsource their production to a developed country if they’re to expand their firm into them, because it’s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren’t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE’S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE’S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming ‘born global’ and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm’s past international experience, which directs the firm’s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE’s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE’s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE’s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they’re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE’s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE’s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn’t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE’s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE’s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can’t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it’s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE’s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE’s have made mistakes and ensuring they don’t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE’s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals’ major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE’s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn’t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they’re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE’s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn’t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county’s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE’s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE’s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE’s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L’s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE’s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A’s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE’s exploit global linkages to become ‘latecomers’ by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second ‘L’ really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning’s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE’s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don’t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE’s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it’s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it’s evident EMNE’s and traditional MNE’s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE’s internationalise compared with MNE’s and how differently they use or even don’t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there’s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE’s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE’s and why having ownership advantages isn’t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE’s, and therefore it’s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE’s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE’s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It’s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE’’s can overcome this challenge.",

It is a little pricey but the reviews haves suggested that it is great, especially with the timing from 8am to 7pm, the CEO will be able to attend the cafÃ© from morning to evening. A museum to attend is the museum of contemporary art museum, which is located in the central of Helsinki. It costs $0-15, but with the small price to pay it is a beautiful setting to observe the art pieces on show. For a restaurant meal I have stated that the Restaurant Saaga as it serves the national dish called the PoronkÃ¤ristys. The reviews say that the place has great ambiance. It also serves a vegetarian option as well as an all you can eat buffet which really provides a lot of options. A gift shop which is fairly close is the Kanturin Tupa shop, it provides all the gifts necessary for her kids to take home, it is also relatively close.

      "raw_text": "In the United Kingdom in 2019 there was 1.6% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Postnote, 2020). The high number of ASD children means that it is imperative to have correct measures in place when they are put through police interviewing. There are policies in place to support children under the age of 18 who classed as ‘vulnerable witnesses’ (impairment to intelligence and social functioning), by giving them assistance to provide the best evidence possible in court (Ministry of Justice, 2011). However, in our justice system there are still issues which need to be corrected, as current research shows that when a child is labelled with ‘autism’ the evidence they provide is questioned in credibility by jurors (Crane et al., 2018). <nl><nl>On top of this, the difficulties present in ASD children could significantly impact the information that is gathered by police, as they lack communication, social skills (Knott et al., 2006) and also impairments in memory (Bruck et al., 2007). There are two recommendations which will be examined to help police gather evidence in ASD children.<nl><nl>The standard cognitive interview includes four main techniques (Köhnken et al., 1999). Mental context reinstatement (MRC) is one segment of the interview that requires the person to go back in time to remember the emotions they felt and the physical environment around them (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2011). However, ASD children have impairments in their memory, specifically in their autonoetic consciousness (Gardiner, 2001), this therefore, means that they might find the process of MRC difficult. Evidence has shown this to be true as people with autism recalled fewer details in the MRC interview (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). This is especially relevant to ASD children, as they already tend to recall fewer details than typically developing (TD) children (Williams et al., 2006). Therefore, police need to find an appropriate way of aiding recall for ASD children as the MRC has shown to exacerbate their memory.<nl><nl>The inclusion of sketching as a form of context reinstatement (Sketch-RC) rather than the normal MRC before a free recall has been seen to be beneficial for ASD children in recall (Mattison et al., 2014). A study that delved further into this had used ASD children and TD children to watch a video (Mattison et al., 2018), and then had compared sketch-RC and MRC, following with a free recall afterward. A probed recall phase was also used to gain further detail, but it was entirely based on what the children had stated in their free recall. In this case, the findings supported the usage of sketch-RC in interviewing as ASD children recalled 25% more than the ASD children in the MRC condition. This could be explained by the encoding specificity theory (Tulving, 1972); which states that the ASD children recalled better because the cues were present in encoding and retrieving, so, the sketches helped facilitate these cues more than just mentally reinstating the context. <nl><nl>In contrast, Henry et al (2017) had conducted a similar study but additionally looked into ‘verbal labels’ and ‘registered intermediary’ interviews, there was no improvement in recall to the ASD children in the Sketch-RC or the other two interviews. This comes to question whether Sketch-RC does improve memory recall or were there methodological issues that caused the study to not find any significant results. This study did have its limitations, as Dando et al (2018) had brought this to light. Participants were aimlessly placed in either a live condition or a video condition, 83% of TD children and only 30% of ASD children were placed in the live condition. This could have impacted the significance of the results because ASD children are more perceptive of their surroundings, as they process sensory information around them differently (O’Neill and Jones, 1997), therefore the children could have encoded the information differently when streaming a video version rather than witnessing the live event, impacting the validity of the results. <nl>Even though there might be drawbacks to the article’s methodology to cause the results to not support sketch-RC, there are still several studies that reinforce the idea of how positive the sketch-RC can be in real life. For instance, a field study had looked into children’s accounts of sexual abuse. The use of drawing had significantly increased the amount of detail recalled, rather than just a standard interview (Katz &amp; Hershkowitz, 2009). With this in mind, sketch-RC has shown to be valuable in the real world as well as in just studies, so police should highly consider using this method to capture more information. <nl> <nl>The takeaway message is that the MRC in a cognitive interview might not be an appropriate measure to gather information from ASD children. So, the use of sketch-RC might be considered more appropriate than MRC when conducting a cognitive interview for ASD children, as it allows them to access memories using the contextual cues from their sketches. This will be fairly important in real life as each information given by the witness can help in finding the perpetrator or piecing the investigation together. <nl>Consequently, social interaction is vital in police interviewing, as it requires a verbal exchange of information. However, ASD children tend to lack the social skills to interact and confidently communicate to get their ideas across (Knott et al., 2006). The cognitive interview, therefore, might pose a problem, as ASD children will consider it socially demanding (Johnson, et al., 2018), which might cause them to become distressed and impact their retrieval of information (Quas &amp; Lench, 2007).<nl><nl>On account of this, the advancements in technology can allow police interviews to be conducted with robots rather than humans to minimise the distress (Wood et al., 2013). There have been significant benefits in the use of robots, as they have shown to improve the social skills of TD children (Robins et al., 2004; Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014) and in ASD children (Wainer et al., 2010).<nl>The creation of ‘Kinesics and Synchronization in Personal Assistant Robotics’ (KASPAR) has shown to be beneficial to ASD children. An observational study had been conducted to see how children would react to the KASPAR with adults present (Robins et al., 2009). They had found that the ASD children interacted positively by smiling, touching, and gazing at the KASPAR. Also, an important finding they had found was that it helped facilitate social interactions with the co-present adult. This could be beneficial in police interviewing as it will help support the ASD child in feeling comfortable, but also can act as a social mediator for when ASD children are being interviewed. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, evidence has shown that the KASPAR does come with its challenges, as a study had found that children were scared of viewing the robot because of how it looked (Huijnen et al., 2018). This would undermine the use of KASPAR, as it would cause further distress and impacting the ASD child’s memory.<nl><nl>Opposed to this view, a reinforcing study by Wood et al (2013) had comparable results to Robins et al (2009) using the KASPAR. However, the study involved the children to be interviewed in a similar manner to a police interview, as they had used questions that would retrieve facts and not feelings from the children. The eye gaze and interview duration were much longer when the interviewer was a KASPAR rather than a human. This key finding links with ASD children as eye contact is a necessary part of communication (Nation and Penny., 2008). This adds support to the use of KASPAR in police interviews as it will help ASD children to feel at ease and help in memory recall; but also this study helps put in perspective how the use of a robot could help ASD children in a police setting. <nl>ASD children’s perception of the KASPAR allows us to understand why they feel more closer to robots than humans. They seem to identify them as toys (Peca et al., 2014) and neither a living nor non-living being (Kahn et al., 2012); suggesting that robots are seen as less intimidating than humans, which allows them to react to them in an anthropomorphic way. <nl><nl>However, with the recent addition of rapport-building in the cognitive interview, it can be argued that there might not be a need for the KASPAR. As the rapport-building phase has demonstrated to make children feel comfortable and confide to the interviewer considerably more (Hershkowitz, 2011). In opposition to this, the use of robots has seemed to show the same effects as the rapport-building phase, as a study had shown that children were more likely to share the secret to the robot than to the teacher after being prompted equally in both conditions (Bethel et al., 2011). Therefore, the use of a robot could be more beneficial and less time consuming when gaining information from a child.<nl><nl>In summary, the evidence above provides the KASPAR to accomplish what a human interviewer might not be able to in a cognitive interview. It suggests that the KASPAR can aid children in feeling relaxed, as this is important in salvaging memories of the witnessed event. But most importantly it can help the police interviewers by acting as a social mediator between the child and the interviewer. Police should therefore highly consider the use of a KASPAR for ASD children.<nl><nl>To conclude, both uses of a sketch-RC and a humanoid robot appear to support ASD children in memory. Sketch-RC is an improvement from the standard MRC as it visually helps ASD children to see the contextual cues. The KASPAR also helps benefit in the interaction of the ASD child and the interviewer, which in turn allows the child to feel at ease and not impede their memory. Both recommendations have a significant amount of evidence to support their use, yet there have been a few limitations which interferes in their validity of being useful. It should however still be considered in the use of police interviews.",

      "raw_text": "\"Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Hodges et al, 2020). A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The ‘Big 3’ psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED).<nl>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn’t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe’s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing  failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system. This can explain social and communication impairments e.g., lack of shared enjoyment and failure to use non-verbal behaviours. However, ToM fails to account for RRB such as a tendency for routinesrules and circumscribed interests. <nl>ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976). This can be due to perseverative behaviour. However, Minshew et al (1992) found perseverative ability is linked to verbal IQ as they found no differences between TD and HFAI. Thus, ED cannot solely and universally explain deficits. Furthermore, IWA have planning deficits illustrated in Tower of Hanoi task (Ozonoff &amp; Jensen, 1999). However, Hughes (1996) found IWA were able to do puzzles requiring  fewer steps. Although planning isn’t completely impaired, disruption of routinesrules causes distress to IWA (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<nl>Studies aforementioned do not account for individual differences, as performances may be different in HFAI due to  Verbal IQ. Furthermore, ED also occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and Tourette’s who perform similarly to IWA on executive function tests (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).  This limits the potential of ED as a diagnostic marker for ASD. <nl>The Weak Central Coherence theory (WCC) (Frith, 1989) states IWA possess a bias towards local elements. Evidence for this is in embedded figures (Witkin, 1971) and block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983), in which children with ASD displayed superior performance. Furthermore, Happe (1996) found IWA weren’t susceptible to visual illusions. These local biases can account for IWA showing pre-occupations for parts of objects. In further support, Hobson &amp; Lee (1998) found IWA do not process faces as a whole as they weren’t susceptible to inversion effect, due to this local bias processing. Furthermore, IWA show activity in primary visual cortex, linked to perception (Chung &amp; Son, 2020) which can explain performances, therefore, WCC isn’t a sole explanation for superior performances. Frith &amp; Snowling (1983) found IWA failed to use appropriate associations on homograph tasks, as they focused on sole words instead of the whole context, further supporting WCC. This can explain social communicative impairments such as sustaining conversation or developing relationships. Although, Lopez &amp; Leekam (2003) found IWA were able to use appropriate word associations in their visual homograph task suggesting such deficits are sensitive to task modalities.  <nl>In conclusion, the ‘Big 3’ psychological theories contribute to the ASD clinical profile to an extent.  ToM can account for social and communicative impairments, but not universally, as well as inability to explain RRB. Although, EDT can account for RRB i.e., adherence to routinesrules, is not exclusive to ASD. The WCC accounts for social and non-social behaviours but brain regions also play a role. This shows ASD is a multiple deficit disorder without a one theory fits all. The fractionation theory suggests the 3 domains are distinct at a cognitive level (Happe &amp; Ronald, 2008), but Russell et al (1991) states there is overlap between all domains highlighted in performances and theories, thus further research is need on domain specificity.<nl><nl><question2><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated.

Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question4><nl>Apraxia of speech (AoS) is an acquired motor speech disorder (Ballard, Granier &amp; Robin, 2000). Phonological representation is intact and there is no difficulty in motor realization, but there is an impairment in converting representations into a motor plan; this results in but isn’t limited to; phonological and phonetic speech errors, distorted prosody and groping (visibleauditory attempts to find right position for articulators) (Galluzzi et al, 2015). There are many accounts regarding the cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia which I will compare and contrast.<nl>Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside &amp; Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren’t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production,  which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler &amp; Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors.  <nl>The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and  pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can’t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald &amp; Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template  (Bernhardt &amp; Stemberger, 1998). Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren’t generalisable across all AoS speakers. <nl>The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend &amp; Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic  competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be  due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables ‘da-ba’ compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the ‘da’ is loaded to the buffer first and identical. <nl>In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS.  However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results. Therefore, there isn’t one account which can explain all cognitive difficulties of AoS as results for experiments are inconsistent. Further research into the different hypothesis’ can help tailor treatments for AS.\"",
      "fixed_text": "\"Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Hodges et al, 2020). A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The ‘Big 3’ psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED). ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie and Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn’t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe’s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system.

ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran and Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976).

Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside and Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren’t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production, which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram and Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler and Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors. The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can’t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald and Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template (Bernhardt and Stemberger, 1998). Deger and Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren’t generalisable across all AoS speakers. The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend and Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger and Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables ‘da-ba’ compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the ‘da’ is loaded to the buffer first and identical. In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS. However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results. Therefore, there isn’t one account which can explain all cognitive difficulties of AoS as results for experiments are inconsistent. Further research into the different hypothesis’ can help tailor treatments for AS.\""

      "raw_text": "Hi Sophie, I have compiled a itinerary of all the things you would want to do on your trip to Helsinki for your two-day conference on the 2nd-4th September. Firstly, I have found a hotel called the Radisson Blue seaside hotel as i know you like the water and would want to be near it, this hotel is only 1 mile away from the Hetrikani beach and has stunning ocean views from the room. it is Â£77 a night within your budget and has many features such as AC, barlounge, a gym in case you would want to blow off any steam from the conference. It has many positive reviews and is deemed one of the best in Helsinki! It also is near many great sights so travelling will be very convenient. It is 6 mins from a museum as well as 2 mins from a escape room in case you would want to partake any other activities during your trip. The cafe I found for you to have breakfast at is called Eckberg cafe and is only a 12 min walk away from the hotel and they have many positive reviews and the images of the food also look amazing! The national museum of Finland are home to many artefacts and feature a great deal of history which will be perfect for you to get to know the history of the place and is only a 20 minute metro journey from the hotel, with the metro also near the hotel, perfect for travelling there! In terms of the restaurant, I found the restaurant Olo for you, it has a unique ambience with amazing food and are cautious with dietary requirements as I know you are allergic to shellfish. This restaurant is also close by to the hotel being 19 mins away! The lioporo gift shop is also home to some amazing handmade souvenir and typical souvenirs so you can get authentic gifts for your children, and again this is all close by so you don't have to worry about not having time due to your busy schedule! Finally, I know you wanted a nice live music venue to wind down in the evenings and I have found the Tavasata which is the no.1 live music venue in Helsinki and is described as legendary and iconic and is only 6 mins away! I will confer with you later about all these places and I hope they are to your liking. Best wishes, Sobia",

Good evening, I would like to discuss how I would be able to change my assigned thesis supervisor, because my current supervisor is not as helpful with regard to my final year thesis. I understand that this assignment would be one of the most important assignments that I would need to do in my academic year and that I would need regular advice and support to achieve work that is reflective of my capabilities, but I am not receiving that support currently from my current supervisor. Thank you Regards . Good afternoon, Thank you for help, I just have two questions, since I haven't left my house meaning I haven't gone to any specialists about it, so wouldn't that mean my form would just be rejected automatically? Also, if I am able to submit in October next year, would that mean I have to pay for another year's university fee and also not graduate this year? Thank you Regards . Good morning, if I deferred my attempt, would that mean I have to pay another year's fee and would that also mean I can't take on a masters next year if I decide to? Thank you Regards Good afternoon, I like to ask whether this masters course would require an unofficial transcript from the JuneJuly exam boards, or an official transcript before November YYYY.

      "raw_text": "Understanding what the modern state is, is linked to understanding its historical emergence and identifying its four key characteristics, a claim over territory, external and internal sovereignty, a claim to legitimacy, and bureaucracy. A common view is that the modern state emerged when the fifteenth century absolutist state came to be seen as separate from an individual ruler (Kamrava, 2012). Defining the state differs depending upon whether the concept of force or morality is stressed, or a combination of both (Hoffman and Graham, 2013). As this essay aims to examine the relevance of philosopher, Machiavelli in accordance with his view of the state, a definition based on a mixture of will and force will firstly be explored through an analysis of his most notable work, The Prince. Exposure to the key themes from, Discourses on Livy will also ensure an efficient examination of the usefulness of his ideas in understanding the nature of the modern state. To further assess the effectiveness of relevance, an exploration of scholarly texts on his beliefs on human nature will be present, along with his political philosophy, informed by evaluations of princely and republican regimes of native Italy. To strengthen the critical examination, thoughts of other political philosophers, including, Aristotle, Rousseau, and the influenced Gramsci, will be used to emphasise the inherent flaws he is often recognised and highly criticised for.<nl>Italian Marxist Gramsci, who viewed the state as not containing just one central attribute, traced his view back to Machiavelli’s The Prince, that stated there are two means of fighting: ‘one according to the laws, the other with force; the first way is proper to man, the second to beasts’ (Hoffman and Graham, 2013). When depicting the renaissance prince, Machiavelli argued that as the first is ‘’not sufficient to maintain power’’, it becomes ‘’necessary to have recourse to the second’’, highlighting a dual personality of which the character of a prince should comprise of (Machiavelli, 2020). The process of acquiring power is the main theme followed in The Prince, and is the key quality several political thinkers like Plato and Aristotle had concerned themselves with and had considered state-power as a means to a higher end formed in moral terms. However, Machiavelli adopted a different perspective. He believed the power of the state is the end of the state, specifically every state must aim at maximizing its power. Consequently, he confined his attention to the means beneficial to the acquisition and maintenance of power. The main way of which, was for the existence of good arms that would have coincided with good laws. In chapter XIV of the prince he writes, \"when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states\", a statement respectable to follow not only for the rulings of 15th century Italy, but also the nature of the modern state, because we know that all states have the right to insist force to ensure their internal and external sovereignty (Machiavelli, 2020). An example in contemporary politics could be the situation in Yemen whereby there is an apparent failure to defend internal sovereignty from a domestic group challenging it, which has led to not only government corruption but also a severe humanitarian crisis. Though, we can compare the factor of state sovereignty and Machiavelli’s persistent use of ‘power’, It is important to realise that ensuring sovereignty does not mean a state is all-powerful, as it depends on many other factors, including the wealth of a state. The better funded a state is, the sovereignty results in much greater power. <nl>Like The Prince, Discourses on Livy acknowledges several interpretations. Political theorist Quentin Skinner in the 1970s, emphasised the work’s republicanism. This interpretation focuses on Machiavelli’s many pro-republican comments, such as his importance on the republican virtue of self-sacrifice as a way of preventing corruption (Skinner, 1998). However, Machiavelli’s republicanism does not follow the typical republican premise that power is safer in the hands of many rather than in the hands of one. To the contrary, he contends that, to establish or reform a republic, it is necessary to \"be alone\". Any ordering must depend on a single mind; thus, Romulus \"deserves excuse\" for committing acts of murder in the founding of Rome, because it was for the common good. This statement is as close as Machiavelli ever came to stating, \"the end justifies the means\", a phrase closely associated with interpretations of The Prince, whereby he urges for the ideal prince to only focus on the end of his endeavours, irrespective of the means (Machiavelli, 2015). Inevitably, his political philosophy looks at politics as goal driven, unbound by morals, and is represented as unscrupulous. His perspective is in direct conflict with that of Aristotle’s who supported the close relation between morality and political actions and argued that in politics there ought to be moral goals that are to be attained (Aristotle and Everson, 1988). Both Aristotle and Plato believed in the moral nature of the state, but Machiavelli entirely disregarded this view. According to him, although morality is essential for citizens, it is not necessary for the ruler, thereby issuing the distinction between private and public morality. A ruler has primary duty of preserving the state. Therefore, he has a right to use instruments of immorality like, deception and killings, for the state (Machiavelli, 2020). The idea channelled here that, absolute morality is neither possible nor desirable in politics, can be useful in understanding the nature of the modern state when considering the resurgence of a corrupt state. For example, a corrupt state cannot be reformed without a heavy amount of violence, an unacceptable method from the standards of private morality. <nl>Similar to Skinner, Jean-Jacques Rosseau interpreted The Prince as ‘’the book of Republicans\" and praised it for being a courageous essay that at last explained the distinction between judging the actions of princes and the actions of humans believed it showed how politics is autonomous from ethics (Viroli, 2013). However, Viroli, in general, and (2013) rejects Rosseau’s defence and argues that his interpretation comes from his desire to rescue Machiavelli’s bad reputation and to allow The Prince to show consistency with the Discourses on Livy. Although his intention was righteous, the view that Machiavelli deserves credit for discovering the principle of autonomy of politics from morals, is reprehensible due to the distortion of his text (Viroli, 2013). Examples of his work, cited by supporters of the theory of the autonomy of politics, refer to human beings as well as Princes. A specific example is the title and contents of chapter XV, ‘’Of Those Things for Which Men, and Particularly Princes, Are Praised or Blamed’’. The idea that he is rejecting the relevance of ethics on all human beings can be viewed here. The lack of concise differing standards presented, is what makes his work invalid to cite, for the uses of the theory of autonomy of politics. <nl>If Machiavelli did theorize the principle of the autonomy of politics, he would have formed a very poor concept, due to his strict ambition of rejecting the judgement of the actions of leaders based on ethical standards. Viroli, (2013) believes this is a weak concept because without ethical standards to judge the actions of leaders, we would have no defence against corrupt and oppressive politicians. Therefore, they should exist but when thinking about the nature of the modern state today, we must consider the reality of this in practice. <nl>Underpinning Machiavelli’s philosophy and where most of his criticism is disputed from, is a particular view of Human Nature. Having learnt from observations of numerous European leaders, Machiavelli believed that human nature was changeless and essentially evil. The Prince portrays a corrosive view of human nature, fundamentally describing humans as selfish, and unreliable, \"Men are quick to change ruler when they imagine they can improve their lot.\", irrational, \"Men are so thoughtless’’, and greedy, \"men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony’’ (Machiavelli, 2020). Nevertheless, he believed these natural inclinations could be moulded by social institutions and strong leadership. Therefore, he took interest in the methods of leadership and how to organise a state to enable socialisation and the taming of human nature. On the other hand, Rousseau believed humans were naturally endowed with pity and compassion. As discussed in The Discourse on Inequality and The Social Contract, the state of nature is the hypothetical place where humans live uncorrupted by society, citing freedom of all its citizens as its most fundamental objective (Rousseau, 2002). Although many view Rousseau’s ideal society as unrealistic and utopian, his emphasis of equality has influenced liberal thought. Considering the relevance of both attitudes, in regards to the characteristics of the modern state, we can view national identity, as a powerful source of legitimacy, holding strong connection with Rousseau’s theory that the state of nature is essential in order for people to recognise their natural goodness. A state can gain legitimacy usually by some claim of citizen representation. Likewise, the function of a bureaucracy to build schools allows for citizens to gain freedom through education. Therefore, Machiavelli’s more harsh reasoning for the underdeveloped state, does not fully reflect the nature of the modern state, especially as we see it today. It is crude, and unjustly limits the natural good of human nature. <nl>Despite its cynicism, a specific concept of Machiavelli’s view may be more modern in politics than suggested. This is the ancient custom he incites throughout The prince, of comparing humans with animals, and stating how adaptability of these is a leadership priority (Machiavelli's The Prince, part 7: the two sides of human nature | Nick Spencer, 2020). Earlier I touched upon the view of fighting with force as a beastly attribute. Other animalistic features significant for a prince to \"draw on both natures\" are the strength of a lion and cunningness of a fox (Machiavelli, 2020). Although the concept of human and animal nature being used metaphorically to describe an ideal or reality is ancient, the emphasis that the two natures, act as resources to portray different qualities, is what brings success in a leader, is an observation we can make today. The frequent use of verbs like, ‘adopt’, ‘employ’ ‘disguise’ and ‘change’ connote a reassurance that leaders must only use these animalistic qualities on a temporary and fluctuating basis. Adaptability and flexibility, not essentially prescribed in the essence of brute animal nature, are still key qualities a leader needs for success, because in ones duration of power, society adapts with new challenges that arise, of which leadership must respond to and will do so by adaptation. A close example to show the failure of adaptation and consequent weak leadership is, Brexit. David Cameron’s departure, after the referendum result suggests he had no capability as well as willingness to adhere to such change. Likewise, Theresa May’s catastrophic turn of events during the withdrawal process, represented by her internal government unpopularity, suggests how she was unable to instil a \"strong and stable\" leadership. <nl>Overall, we can use Machiavelli’s basic suggestion that in politics, it is not always rational to be moral, as a way of understanding the nature of the modern state, but must remember to recognise this in the light of different types of morality. His emphasis on power is valid when contemplating what will bring a prince the ultimate amount of success and his idealist thoughts on the judgement by ethical standards is permissible because there has and always will be a prevalent distinction reflected in politics. His view of human nature, however, is not useful as guidance in understanding how the state should be structured, as if followed will lead to a dismal and detrimental society, shaped by our own pessimistic cultures. We have seen that social contract theorists offer a much more pleasant view of human nature, so if we truly wanted to live in a harmonious state, that was successful in all key characteristics than we should look more to the philosophy of Rousseau.",

I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost £216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is £16 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Sauteéd Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions. If you have any queries or changes, please let me know and I will be happy to look further. Best Wishes",

Materials: The materials used was the Toronto word pool (http:euclid.psych.yorku.cashinyTWP) to generate the word displayed and also an online metronome clicker Procedure: A 30-word list was presented to participants by using the Toronto word pool which is used to generate the words that the participants see. This was followed by a word recognition task where the previous words were presented with a set of new words that were not seen before in single and dual task conditions. This list was repeated 4 times but between each study the participant completed a mental arithmetic task. Participants in the single task condition were then asked to recall the first word list that was presented to them. Participants in the dual task condition followed the same process of recalling list of words presented to them whilst taking part in recognition tasks however also had to take part in a finger tapping task requiring the participant to tap their finger during the study. This required participants to tap their finger to the rhythm of the metronome clicker which clicked once per second. For the older participants, to reduce systematic errors, a Latin square response was used in order to help correct any false recognition which is when participants keep pressing ‘yes’ even when incorrect. Results The Shapiro-Wilk test was not significant (p > .05) for all conditions and all age groups, so the data are normally distributed and is suitable for a parametric analysis."

According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual’s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual’s views of social media rather than their life experiences.

It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. <nl>Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count<nl>Introduction<nl>The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). <nl>The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. <nl>A partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear?

Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion.

There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset.

      "fixed_text": "\"Intro The Alpha Inhibition Hypothesis (AIH) is when high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas. the current experiment tested the alpha inhibition hypothesis using a cued visual attention task and predicted that; if recording from the left parietal lobe participants' alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right condition. Method A partial replication of an experiment was conducted, and it included recording alpha amplitudes from the left parietal lobe (P3), analysing the activity 200ms before stimulus onset in the cue left and cue right conditions. Results The results were significant and were consistent with the hypothesis. It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures and reference list not included in count Introduction The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. A partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes? Method Participants 38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant’s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. Design The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right.

      "raw_text": "Introduction.  <nl>This strategy paper will focus on combatting the maltreatment of house girls which indicates that gender inequality still exists, thus being perpetuated through the form of violence against women. The strategy will focus on passing laws to criminalise abusers and to formalise the industry by establishing policy surrounding working pay and overall job protection. This paper will begin by outlining background information surrounding the role of house girls and the challenges they face.  <nl>The main body of the paper will then express the previous strategies used, as well as new strategies that can be implemented to alleviate the problem. This will be compared to the context of South African legislation to show their success in emulating such an issue. By including goals, theories and potential allies this paper will provide an effective solution to curve the rate of abuse towards house girls. <nl>Lastly the conclusion will end with summarising all of the findings that seek to combat the issue at hand. <nl><nl>What is a house girl?<nl>According to Oxford dictionary, a house girl is \"defined as a female slave who works in a house (now historical); or any young female domestic servant or employee, especially in some former British dependencies. (Later)\"<nl>For centuries many women and girls have taken on domestic work in the role of domestic house girls as a means for escaping extreme poverty. This industry is normalised in less developed countries especially within Africa. In Nigeria, the most densely populated African country, house girls are particularly popular however due to the lack of workers’ rights, desperation of employees and ineffective laws to protect workers, many girls are prone to maltreatment. This ranges from poor living conditions, sexual abuse and a lack of basic human rights as a whole. <nl><nl>Causes of the problem.<nl>House girls in Nigeria are usually employed by upper- and middle-class families with disposable income to spare and girls as young as 10 start working in such roles. The fundamental reason why this practise is widespread is due to poverty, with \"females from low-income households expected to work, often to contribute to the economic sustenance of the family thus playing the role as the breadwinner\" (Nwaubani 2017). Many people from rural areas travel into main cities such as Lagos in search of better employment opportunities and means of livelihood. <nl> Furthermore, in Nigeria, there is a large disparity between the education level that boys and girls receive, with many girls failing to have access to adequate education past a certain age. <nl>This is exemplified through UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2015 where female adult literacy rates (ages 15 and above) in Nigeria was 59.4% in comparison to the male rate of 74.4%. This disparity is a main contributor to why many young women become house girls. Csapo, M (1981) explains how, in particular, in the northern region, Nigerian women are considered secondary citizens therefore education is not so much a priority. Parents, especially that of Muslim heritage are reluctant to send their girls to school due to fear of moral laxity from the westernised teachings.<nl>These customs and beliefs contribute to the disrespect women face whilst at work. The patriarchal society that Nigeria operates on further opens up doors for abuse this is exemplified through feminist theory which view \"oppression of women and patriarchal privilege as a mechanism for violence against women\" (Napikoski 2020). Women who seek to become house girls at whatever educational level should be given the same rights as any other worker. <nl>Furthermore, many house girls lack a job with good working conditions and security due to the lack of labour laws being enforced. This under- the-radar market allows for women to work under exhausting conditions subject to poor pay and long hours and constant insults from their employers. Girls who work for over 8 hours a day are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted due to the time spent at work being greater.<nl>Media platforms such as Nollywood also depict house girls as poor, needy and constantly faced with maltreatment. This depiction exemplifies itself in reality.<nl>The maltreatment of house girls is also compounded by the fact that the house girl industry is currently informal. There are no regulations and requirements for any worker thus many women remain at the mercy of their boss, simply leaving women vulnerable to crime and exploitative employment.<nl>Children who are a part of this informal sector are especially at risk of sexual exploitation creating long term problems such as unwanted pregnancies and psychosocial trauma. (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2019)<nl>Domestic slavery makes $18 billion alone in Africa and entry into this informal economy has significantly increased in recent times, the house girl economy thrives because of ready availability of services for the market. This in turn cuts through all necessary checks and procedures which protect female workers. Employers further defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street.<nl>Due to this industry occurring in people’s private household, boundaries between the public and private sphere and the states involvement becomes hard to cross, nevertheless, this is an issue that must be addressed as it is an infringement on human rights and these unfortunate experiences truly manifest themselves in the everyday life of women. <nl><nl>Previous strategies.<nl>Pressure from outsider groups have called for the police and government to protect female workers including house girls due to the trafficking they are prone to. <nl>In 2004, the Nigerian government created the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), an anti-trafficking agency, designed to tackling trafficking. Between 2003-2017, they were successful in recovering over 3000 victims. Furthermore in 2015 Nigeria altered their trafficking laws to elevate penalties for offenders and criminalise those who employed children under 12 in domestic labour. Whilst human rights activists such as The National Human Rights Commission, work with the police and NAPTIP to secure prosecutions and provide shelter and aid for victims, the issue still persists. <nl>At present there are national legislative inconsistencies towards the minimum age to work (2015 US Labour Department report).

      "fixed_text": "Introduction. This strategy paper will focus on combatting the maltreatment of house girls which indicates that gender inequality still exists, thus being perpetuated through the form of violence against women. The strategy will focus on passing laws to criminalise abusers and to formalise the industry by establishing policy surrounding working pay and overall job protection. This paper will begin by outlining background information surrounding the role of house girls and the challenges they face. The main body of the paper will then express the previous strategies used, as well as new strategies that can be implemented to alleviate the problem. This will be compared to the context of South African legislation to show their success in emulating such an issue. By including goals, theories and potential allies this paper will provide an effective solution to curve the rate of abuse towards house girls. Lastly the conclusion will end with summarising all of the findings that seek to combat the issue at hand. What is a house girl? According to Oxford dictionary, a house girl is \"defined as a female slave who works in a house (now historical); or any young female domestic servant or employee, especially in some former British dependencies. (Later)\" For centuries many women and girls have taken on domestic work in the role of domestic house girls as a means for escaping extreme poverty. This industry is normalised in less developed countries especially within Africa. In Nigeria, the most densely populated African country, house girls are particularly popular however due to the lack of workers’ rights, desperation of employees and ineffective laws to protect workers, many girls are prone to maltreatment. This ranges from poor living conditions, sexual abuse and a lack of basic human rights as a whole. Causes of the problem. House girls in Nigeria are usually employed by upper- and middle-class families with disposable income to spare and girls as young as 10 start working in such roles. The fundamental reason why this practise is widespread is due to poverty, with \"females from low-income households expected to work, often to contribute to the economic sustenance of the family thus playing the role as the breadwinner\" (Nwaubani 2017). Many people from rural areas travel into main cities such as Lagos in search of better employment opportunities and means of livelihood. Furthermore, in Nigeria, there is a large disparity between the education level that boys and girls receive, with many girls failing to have access to adequate education past a certain age. This is exemplified through UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2015 where female adult literacy rates (ages 15 and above) in Nigeria was 59.4% in comparison to the male rate of 74.4%. This disparity is a main contributor to why many young women become house girls. Csapo, M (1981) explains how, in particular, in the northern region, Nigerian women are considered secondary citizens therefore education is not so much a priority. Parents, especially that of Muslim heritage are reluctant to send their girls to school due to fear of moral laxity from the westernised teachings. These customs and beliefs contribute to the disrespect women face whilst at work. The patriarchal society that Nigeria operates on further opens up doors for abuse this is exemplified through feminist theory which view \"oppression of women and patriarchal privilege as a mechanism for violence against women\" (Napikoski 2020). Women who seek to become house girls at whatever educational level should be given the same rights as any other worker. Furthermore, many house girls lack a job with good working conditions and security due to the lack of labour laws being enforced. This under- the-radar market allows for women to work under exhausting conditions subject to poor pay and long hours and constant insults from their employers. Girls who work for over 8 hours a day are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted due to the time spent at work being greater. Media platforms such as Nollywood also depict house girls as poor, needy and constantly faced with maltreatment. This depiction exemplifies itself in reality. The maltreatment of house girls is also compounded by the fact that the house girl industry is currently informal. There are no regulations and requirements for any worker thus many women remain at the mercy of their boss, simply leaving women vulnerable to crime and exploitative employment. Children who are a part of this informal sector are especially at risk of sexual exploitation creating long term problems such as unwanted pregnancies and psychosocial trauma. (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2019) Domestic slavery makes $18 billion alone in Africa and entry into this informal economy has significantly increased in recent times, the house girl economy thrives because of ready availability of services for the market. This in turn cuts through all necessary checks and procedures which protect female workers. Employers further defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street. Due to this industry occurring in people’s private household, boundaries between the public and private sphere and the states involvement becomes hard to cross, nevertheless, this is an issue that must be addressed as it is an infringement on human rights and these unfortunate experiences truly manifest themselves in the everyday life of women. Previous strategies. Pressure from outsider groups have called for the police and government to protect female workers including house girls due to the trafficking they are prone to. In 2004, the Nigerian government created the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), an anti-trafficking agency, designed to tackling trafficking. Between 2003-2017, they were successful in recovering over 3000 victims. Furthermore in 2015 Nigeria altered their trafficking laws to elevate penalties for offenders and criminalise those who employed children under 12 in domestic labour. Whilst human rights activists such as The National Human Rights Commission, work with the police and NAPTIP to secure prosecutions and provide shelter and aid for victims, the issue still persists. At present there are national legislative inconsistencies towards the minimum age to work (2015 US Labour Department report). The Child Rights Act prohibits those under 18 from working yet the Labour Act sets the minimum age of employment at 12. This elucidates the inconsistency of the legislative system in protecting female workers. Ultimately this ambiguousness needs to be removed or amended in order to tackle violence against house girls. Proposed strategies 1. Registration of employees. Providing domestic help is not the main cause of abuse as across countries, where there is less domestic abuse, this is seen with the likes of au-pairs, nannies, maids etc. such as in the UK. Chinelo Ezenwaadding, a female rights activist, claims \"the house help industry can be a positive thing because you get to help others, but it should be regulated and there should be laws governing the treatment of maids.\" Therefore, by establishing employment policy standards we can reach a greater environment for workers and tackle violence cases. I believe this is the most utilitarian approach. In Nigeria, there is a high number of house girls that have not been recognised as official workers, thus feed into the informal economy. This presents several problems and avoidable situations such as limited accessibility to any legal rights if needed. \"The informal economy represents a multi‐facetted and spatially diverse phenomenon\" (Fajana 2008). However, through regulation of this informal work, advantages will arise such as industrial peace and order. Therefore, every female of the legal working age needs to be put on a governmental system acknowledging house girls as established employees. Workers must be registered in order to start working providing this switch from an informal to formal sector will reduce the chances of maltreatment through ending under aged workers and exploitation towards females. Accountability for any unethical matters can be upheld and under-the-radar crimes which were once hard to record can now be accounted for. By implementing this policy the economy will be regulated and VAW reduced. 2. Establishing a living minimum wage. The Capitalist Entrepreneurial Theory (Schumpeter 1942) aims to give an explanation behind inequality and poverty claiming \"the payment of meagre wage rates, as well as unfair, poor and irritating working conditions, are means of exploiting the masses of workers and excessive, illustrating the constant cycle of poverty for these working women\". However this needs to be dismantled through giving a basic living salary that workers can survive on and is fairly reflected through the work they do. According to Naira Land Forum, \"house girls are paid from as little as 15,000 to 30,000 naira equating to £29.64-59.27 a month\". This contradicts with the monthly cost of living, which according to Statisais, is 43,000 naira thus illustrating how female workers are prone to no personal growth opportunities. Many of these women have economic responsibilities leaving them no choice but to work even for a minimum wage. Poverty is a primary risk factor that renders women and girls vulnerable to sex trafficking\" (PJI 2018) \"The growing labour force of this informal sector means that informal economy workers accept wages below the legal minimum levels\" (Anyanwu, 1994) this effects house girls, which in essence means that employment contacts between both employee and employer must be established, setting out hours of work and legal workers’ pay . This will reduce any form of financial abuse and studies imply that the best approach to lessen violence against women is to combine economic empowerment and gender equity efforts. This must be made universal for all working women and government must intervene to enabling this is established. England has successfully demonstrated this with implementing contracts for au- pairs which state clear agreements on provisions regarding regulated working hours and pay. Nigeria must adapt this same approach to allow for female emancipation. 3. Establishing a skills workshop. A weak to non-existent system for protecting children from abuse is prevalent across Nigeria (Santos Pais 2014) A community based approach, which doesn’t allow the lack of education to be a hindrance to one’s progression, is an essential tool towards female independence. Through providing government funded, free access to vocational skills for house girl who have been abused, this safe space will equip females with a broad set of skills to prepare them for another job sector. This differs from conventional shelters in that it re-trains females -emphasising the importance of rehabilitation to go back into the world of work thus enabling them to generate income to sustain themselves and their families. This approach can be further recognised through government coalition -working with local churches and charities to bring awareness to this cause. 4. Legal reform. South African legislators have showed commitment to addressing violence against women through passing the Domestic Violence Act in 1998 which introduced minimum sentences for rape and tightened bail requirements for those accused of rape. Through establishing a new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disability this further denotes commitment to combatting violence against women and seeked to go against the cultural norms towards violence against women especially within private households were proof of abuse was often difficult obtain. As a result, significant contributions consisted of an increased conviction rate and a decrease in rape cases. \"In Nigeria among women aged 15–49 who have survived physical or sexual violence, 45% never got help or told anyone about the experience\" (NPC and ICF International 2014).Therefore the same legal and effective approaches must be taken by Nigerian policy makers to protect the rights of female house girls with potential threats that they could be faced with. A safe haven must be created for house girls who have been victimised thus providing severe consequences for criminals who perform and assist in abusing house girls. This unequivocally will drive down the cases of abuse. Structurally, a national framework protecting house girls from abuse should be established across Nigeria. Law enforcement officers are fundamentally necessary at the frontline of the criminal justice system. Their attitude and response towards violence against house girls can have a dramatic impact on ensuring the prevention of future violent acts and that the protection of victims are upheld. Violence against women and girls cannot be fought by women alone. Thus, law enforcement officers must be adequately trained and compensated so that they willing to do their jobs diligently. A South African project in 2000 successfully provided resources for facilitators to train prosecutors working in the area of VAW. This highlights that through time, investment and attitudinal changes Government efforts can be effective. Conclusion. To conclude a strategy which focuses on legislative and humanitarian goals is crucial in reducing the rates of abuse. In co-operation with the Nigerian government the strategies presented in this paper will improve the standard of living for house girls and provide a modernised criminal justice system in which justice can be ratified if any women has been treated unfairly. It will also push house girls out of poverty alleviation and give women the tools to gain workers freedom, a concept that should be universal for all house girls across the globe. Ultimately the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria is challenging to dismantle but efficient implementations of these proposed tactics will combat the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria."

      "fixed_text": "The Stroop Test, first developed in 1935 by John R. Stroop, was designed to study the effect of interference when presented with pairs of conflicting stimuli (Stroop, 1935). This original study showed that the verbal identification of the colour of a word is delayed by the word being a colour-word and incongruent to the font colour (Allport, 1990). The Stroop Test shows the effect of inhibition, a central executive function used to override an immediate response to a stimulus, demonstrated by the overriding of the semantic meaning of the word shown in order to correctively identify the font colour (Eysenck and Keane, 2015). It is also an example of automaticity in reading (Hunt and Ellis, 2004). Automatic processes are not conducted with intent, they are not able to be thought through before they happen, and do not take up any conscious processing capacity; The Stroop test demonstrates this with the automaticity involved when the stimulus is first seen (Posner and Snyder, 1975). The fact that the Stroop test covers so many aspects of cognitive processing makes it a significant study in the field of cognitive psychology. Variations of the study also provide a range of results on which hypotheses can be based. Based on past research, it is predicted that when the colours are incongruent, the time taken to respond to the font colour will be longer in comparison to when the colours are congruent. Method Participants 123 participants were used from a volunteer sample of Aston University 1st Year Psychology students, ranging from approximately 18-22 years old. Design The study was a within subjects design, with each participant responding to both congruent and incongruent stimuli, this being the independent variable; whether the font colour was congruent with the colour meaning of the word. The dependent variable was the response time for the participants to report the colour of the font. Materials Superlab was used to create and conduct the study, and using the Superlab timing feature enabled accurate response times to be obtained. A set of simple jpeg images were used as stimuli. These showed various colour words in various coloured fonts (red, blue, green, or yellow), with half of the stimuli’s meaning and font colour being the same (congruent) or different (incongruent). The participants could use Superlab’s response option to input the font colour of each stimulus using a set of coloured computer keys, and once having familiarised themselves with the order of the keys they were able to respond as soon as they had processed the colour of the stimuli. Procedure Firstly, participants were given a full briefing on the experiment and it’s aims, as past studies had shown that there was little-to-no effect of participants knowing the experiment aims. They were asked to sign a consent form, allowing their data to be used in the experiment report. Instructions were given verbally; however, this was unnecessary as all participants were already familiar with the experiment. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the font colour of the stimuli, but ignore the meaning of the words shown. The participants were told to respond by tapping a coloured computer key corresponding with their response. Their response times were recorded by the Superlab program. The stimuli were presented one at a time in a random order, with congruence and incongruence also randomised and counterbalanced. Results Only 115 out of the total 123 participants inputted results, causing n to equal 115. There was a significant difference between colour congruent and colour incongruent conditions (T = 1932.00, n = 115, p < 0.001). As mean reaction times were larger in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition, the participants took significantly longer to identify font colours when they were incongruent with the meaning of the colour word. The standard deviations suggest that there was a high variance in both conditions, but more variance in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition. Discussion The results obtained from the experiment showed that participants took significantly longer to correctly respond to the font colour stimulus when the font colour was incongruent with the word meaning than when the font colour was congruent. This is concurrent with past experiments in the same area and is consistent with the original hypothesis. The results collected can be used to explain many aspects of perception and internal processing.

      "raw_text": "Johns Case: <nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John’s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John’s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john’s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John’s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John’s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. <nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D’Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually ‘coping’ as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns’ case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).",

For example, ‘all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.’  Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000).

This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, ‘if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.’ However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, ‘if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.’ Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.",

      "raw_text": "This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies.  <nl>Why is this a problem?<nl>There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020).<nl>Why is this an important issue for gender equality?<nl>As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman’s education less than that of a man’s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). <nl>Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education<nl>There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007).<nl>Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children’s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015).<nl>Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017).<nl>Proposed Strategies<nl>My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017).<nl>Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families’ access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020).<nl>The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents’ evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. <nl>To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India’s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents’ evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.",

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>After winning a costa first novel award, The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer (2013) became a piece of popular fiction, inviting a broad range of readers. However, it’s brutal depiction of mental illness means there are differing responses to the text. ‘Reader response data’ has become a popular way for researchers to identify how a reader places themselves in relation to a text through assessing their responses to said text. <nl>This study will assess how reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’ align themselves to The Shock of the Fall’s protagonist and overall narrative. Oatley’s (1999) theory of \"identification\" or \"observer\" will be drawn upon for this purpose, as well as Stockwell’s (2009) discussion of reading metaphors, so that commonalities can emerge to determine factors that cause alignment with the text. To compliment these theories, language analysis more generally will be utilised in order to collectively lead to an understanding of reader positioning within the data sets.<nl><nl>Literature Review<nl>The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer is a piece of experimental fiction portraying the deteriorating mind of the protagonist, Matthew. McCarthy-Jones (2018) praises Filer for his \"beautiful\" form and word choice, whilst Armstrong (2014, 173) highlights the brilliant use of \"complex narrative structure\" and experimental use of \"graphics and fonts\". Moreover, Armstrong argues that the novel is brilliant both in its insightful portrayal of the family bond, but also in its depictions of mental health. Similarly, Rajasingam (2014) believes the novel depicts the inpatient experience with such accuracy that it could be beneficial for junior doctors to understand the bleak realities of these unique situations. This accurate depiction is most likely down to Filer’s personal experience as a psychiatric nurse (Sanai 2014), as he was seemingly able to amalgamate his previous experience to create the protagonist, Matthew.<nl>This study utilises reader response data. Reader response data is seen as a \"rigorous and evidence based\" approach to understanding reader interactions with a text (Whiteley and Canning 2017). Fish (1970) discusses how a text comes into being through reader interaction. Therefore, reader response data allows us to seek, understand and interpret reader’s interactions with certain texts through different means, which is why it is utilised within this research to determine factors of alignment within reader reviews. <nl>The basis of this research surrounds Oatley’s (1995;1999) theory discussing alignment with a text. Oatley (1999) argues there are two positions a reader adopts; \"identification\" or \"observer\". He believes that the observer is a spectator role, in which we are an objective outsider in a narrative, whereas identification occurs when a reader aligns themselves with the protagonist, taking on their goals and emotions. Moreover, he argues that a first-person narrative favours identification, whereas third-person narratives favour the spectatorobserver role. Identification is therefore seen as an intense alignment with the protagonist, with Oatley stating we \"become that person\" in the narrative (Oatley 1999, 446), made ever more present if the reader can sympathise with the protagonist through personal experience (Oatley 1995). However, it is important to note that these alignments are part of a scale where readers have autonomy, as opposed to having a fixed state in one position.  <nl>To analyse the position of identification or observer, one of the methods I will be using is metaphor analysis. Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) ‘conceptual metaphor theory’ highlights how we better understand an entity when it is described in relation to another. It shows how metaphors can be \"extended\", allowing us to map the meaning within a metaphor in order to gauge the full detail of the comparison. Dirven et al (2003) highlight the significance of the theory, arguing conceptual metaphor theory ignited the importance of metaphor for our understanding of knowledge. Metaphors are useful in conjunction with noticing the identifierobserver role, as the way a reader discusses their experience of reading is often linked to their level of submersion and alignment with the protagonist and the text. <nl>Stockwell (2009) and Gerrig (1993) discuss metaphors more centred around reading. Stockwell (extending knowledge outlined by Gerrig) discusses metaphors that can be used by readers to describe their reading experience. These include \"reading is a journey\", \"reading as transport\" and \"reading as control\" (Stockwell 2009, 80-81). Stockwell (2005, 144) believes critical theorists should \"engage with the texture of the text\", which allows us to read as one does when they are simply reading for enjoyment; a \"natural reader\". With ‘Good Reads’ being a platform for mostly natural readers, we can see how utilising this method will allow inferences for reader position to emerge, as the reviewers discuss their experiences in a natural way, therefore giving their natural alignment with the text. <nl>I will also be drawing on conceptions of ‘stake inoculation’ and ‘category entitlement’ within my analysis. Stake inoculation can be identified when a reader is not presenting a vested interest in a text, and has been described as readers wanting to be \"regarded as considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306). Category entitlement, however, is defined as when certain people in specific situations are given authority for their knowledge in a specific area (Potter 1996). These features can be linked to the need to keep a \"positive face\" that is protected and maintained with the social space (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967). Reviewers may use stake inoculation andor category entitlement in order to portray themselves in a positive light for other reviewers, especially because the site is seen as a \"social network for book reviews\" (Fay 2012). <nl><nl>Methodology<nl>I began my naturalistic study by sourcing reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’; a book reviewing website. This website was useful as it allows users to interact with reviews through ‘likes’, as well as having a rating system (one to five stars) to review the book discussed. As a result, I was able to find the most ‘liked’ reviews within each rating category. By choosing the most ‘liked’ reviews, the assumption can be made that the views described within the review reflect the majority, as they were the most widely interacted with. <nl>After selecting the most liked review from each rating category, I anonymised each review, by naming them R1 (being the review with a one-star rating) to R5 (being the review with a five-star rating), ensuring no ethical issues in relation to confidentiality could occur (See Appendix for full reviews). I then used ‘NVivo’; a form of qualitative data analysis software, to begin my analysis. I ‘coded’ each review in NVivo, which then highlighted areas where there were common themes among each review. This allowed me to make inferences as to the common themes that link to identificationobservation (Oatley 1999) within each of the rating categories. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Comparing uses of Category Entitlement:<nl>One of the most common themes across all of the reviews is category entitlement. All of the reviewers, in one way or another, highlighted their authority within their review. The interesting part about comparing the uses of category entitlement is the difference in tone that occurs depending on how positive or negative the review is. The more negative reviews use this device in order to depict how The Shock of The Fall was a bad novel, because they identified better with certain other novels (R1 and R2). Whereas, the more positive reviews show their identification with The Shock of The Fall by providing examples of other mental health literature that has also made them feel this way (R3, R4 and R5). For example, R5 states they have read \"a number of books regarding mental illness\", but describes this text as \"purely unique\". On the other hand, R1 argues \"I would never recommend this book considering the wealth of options available to readers […]\". Peplow et al (2015, 75) discuss how you can put yourself forward as having \"expert knowledge\", which can be seen through the intentional discussion of broader knowledge. However, they also discuss how readers can \"play down\" their entitlement, which is also present through the subtle portrayals of wider reading as opposed to more direct mentions of expert knowledge (Peplow et al 2015, 74). As ‘Good Reads’ is a platform that invites avid readers, one could argue that a participant of the site would likely house a level of category entitlement simply due to this fact, and therefore their broad knowledge of literature would most likely be conveyed within their reviews, intentionally or not. Moreover, the fact that the website has open access means some reviewers may want to portray, and maintain, a ‘positive face’ (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967), which can be achieved through the use of category entitlement. Therefore, the comparative aspect category entitlement allows the users to present their identificationobservation with the text.<nl>Although in another breadth of mental illness, a study into the effects of reading novels about eating disorders showed participants felt their mood and self-confidence diminished, whilst other genres improved their mood (Troscianko 2018). Despite being about a very different aspect of mental health, I believe these findings highlight how the genre one chooses to focus on can have such ingrained effects on themselves as a reader. In a similar way to Oatley’s (1995) statement about how a reader identifies more intensely if they can empathise with a reader from their personal experience, you could argue that reading fiction of this genre highlights how different forms of mental health literature ignite different reactions for certain individuals. Where the more positive reviews name novels that depict mental health in a way that has \"fascinated\" them (R4) and highlight their appreciation for such literature (R5, R3), the more negative reviews could arguably be having a similar reaction to that laid out in the study mentioned (Troscianko 2018) through their preference of other mental health literature (R2), therefore showing the use of comparison to determine alignment with the text. As the readers all portray themselves to have a broad knowledge of literature, we can see how a novel of such unique nature could create conflicting responses depending on the reviewers individual understanding and perceptions of mental health literature more generally. Therefore, we can see that all of the reviews utilise category entitlement as a device to compare The Shock of the Fall to other texts of a similar vein, which therefore portrays their level of observationidentification depending on how they ‘rank’ this text compared to others they discuss. <nl>Emotive vs Clinical Language – Comparing uses of Reading Metaphors and Stake Inoculation:<nl>Reading metaphors (Stockwell 2009; Gerrig 1993) are an insightful way to decipher the identificationobserver positioning. Stockwell (2009,80) identifies a number of metaphors commonly used by readers; reading is \"transport\", reading is \"control\", and reading is \"investment\". As these responses can be aligned more directly with an investment with the reading material, it isn’t entirely unsurprising that the two top rated reviews are the only reviews which give examples of this use of metaphor. The more positive reviews actively present themselves as having an identification stance through their use of reading metaphors. R5 described being \"grabbed\" and \"held\" by the book, providing an example of the \"reading as control\" metaphor that Stockwell (2009, 80) discusses. As this is the most highly rated review, which speaks very positively about the novel as a whole, is it not surprising that the reader feels so invested in the narrative. However, despite R4 being mostly positive, the metaphors used within their review do not reflect their identification in the same way. R4 utilises \"reading as transport\" (Stockwell 2009, 80) through feelings of being lost in the narrative; \"at times you have to try and remember where you are\", as well as describing the narrative as \"following\" the narrator. Here, the use of metaphor seems to have less intensity; they are not being controlled in the same sense that R5 describes. However, there is still a clear alignment presented, as the reviewer is situated within the narrative for the feeling of being \"lost\" to occur. Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley’s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn’t as far on the ‘identification scale’ as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. <nl>On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy’s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist’s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader’s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. <nl>The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. <nl>Perceptions of Accuracy:<nl>The majority of the reviews comment on Filer’s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"…it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients… get into once they’re sucked into the mental health biz…\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events.<nl>On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3’s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn’t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. <nl>When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley’s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. <nl>It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn’t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does. <nl>",

Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley’s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn’t as far on the ‘identification scale’ as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy’s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist’s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader’s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. Perceptions of Accuracy: The majority of the reviews comment on Filer’s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"…it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients… get into once they’re sucked into the mental health biz…\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events. On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3’s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn’t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. Conclusion Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley’s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn’t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does."

      "raw_text": "Hello, I have found some information regarding your Helsinki trip and wanted to share this with you. Firstly, I understand that you are wanting a hotel by the water. I have found the 'Hilton Helsinki Strand' (£159 on Booking.com) which I hope would be to your taste. It is located right by the sea, and has free internet. It is rated 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor and is within walking distance to the city center. The furnishings are fairly modern. For your breakfast cafe I found two options. Firstly, there is the 'Early Bird'. This is a nine minute walk from the hotel mentioned, and had positive reviews. Secondly, I found the 'Ipi Kulmakuppila' which is a ten minute walk from the hotel mentioned, and serves pastries, whilst also offering a buffet brunch which many people raved about within reviews. A good museum I found was the 'Helsinki City Museum' which \"documents and displays the history of Helsinki\". I know you wanted to learn about the city's history, so thought this would be a good one to look at. I also found a restaurant that serves 'Poronkaristys' which is Helsinki's national dish. The restaurant is called 'Lappi Ravintola' and has 4.5 stars on Google Reviews. I know you would love to get your children a nice souvenir, so I found the shop 'Kankurin Tupa', which is rated 4.3 on Google Reviews. It has a lot of traditional Helsinki souvenirs. Just so you are aware, it closes at 6pm and opens at 10am. Finally, I thought you might be interested in the live music of Helsinki which I know you enjoy. Two top rated locations are 'G LiveLab' which is a bluesjazz club. It is rated number nine of the 'Concerts and Shows of Helsinki' on TripAdvisor. It has great reviews; 4 stars on TripAdvisor and 4.6 on Google Reviews. Another option is 'Storyville' which is a jazz club. It is rated 4.1 on Google Reviews, and one reviewer even said it might just have the best live music in the world - I'll let you be the judge. I hope this information was helpful to you, and I hope you have a great trip. Thank you, Cassidy",

Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness. After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company’s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019).<nl>General rationale for specific tools selected:<nl><nl>In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise’s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions.

An action could be to use local advertising alongside social media to receive discounts during face to face or phone advertising to show empathy to needs for the short term or long term (How much do celebrities and influencers get paid for social posts? - Our Social Times - Social Media for Business, 2020).<nl><nl>Sales Promotion Tool<nl><nl>Sales promotion offers an incentive to encourage target audiences with promotional messages to buy the product sooner than later (Fill and Turnbull, 2016).

Consumers will recall and remember the promotion, bringing in targeted behavioural marketing. Therefore, the student’s interest is captured, making them feel more inclined to sign up for the subscription (The Pros and Cons of Celebrity Endorsements - Baer Performance Marketing, 2020).. This partnership will offer a promotional online code discount and print coupons associated with himself to pull in more consumers to use the service, working towards the goal of reaching 500 buyers by year-end. He is already proactive in supporting Birmingham to make the city a better place through his involvement in projects, he will be more inclined to partner at a lower price than expected by an influencer of his popularity.

Advertising is informing and reminding about the products and services and a form of mass communication and links to sales promotion goals to increase sales quickly using discounts for example.

Additionally, could you provide feedback on anything that can be improved. Many thanks. Regards, . Sorry I forgot to attach it to the previous email. Hi Grissel, Sorry for the late response. Thank you so much for filling out the survey and sending it back to me. I really appreciate it. Hope you're doing well. Regards, .. Hi Elmira, I just remembered a few more things... 1) Do you think it is important to mention the disadvantages too? As the question mentions whether it will benefit the company, do you think it is advised to talk about possible cons too since the question is open? All my answers talk about reasons as to why it will benefit but I haven't mentioned why it many not. 2) I realised I haven't come to a conclusion i.e. a definite yes or no to the question. Is that necessary to put in as I personally think it will be helpful and ensures the question is answered, however there is the element of leaving it open for thought... assuming I am going to be presenting to the manager and tutor. Please let me know your thoughts. Regards, ."

      "raw_text": "\"Hands up. Don’t Shoot!\" \"End SARS!\" \"Go Green!!\" are just a few of the chant slogans many protesters all over the world use. The ample number of protests traversing disparate time zones has caught the attention of academics, critics and communities worldwide. In today’s society, we are witnessing and experiencing is an upsurge of protest. Whether that is in America, Asia, Europe or Sub-Saharan Africa, each continent is living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’. It is right to suggest that there have been recurring themes of inequality, repression and unrest partnered with many failed governments and politics that contribute to this increase. The frequency, scope and size of these protests are considered ‘mass protests’ that have essentially captured media attention, such as those in Britain, Nigeria and North America. Although each protest has a unique context and cause, the common grievances overwhelmingly draw on the opinions and viewpoints of feeble and ineffectual governance, nepotism and malfeasance. Thus, the essay will delve into the claim that indeed, we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’ by analysing the root causes of the increase in global protests. These include inequality, corruption and environmental degradation. Social media will also be used to show how fast news spread which potentially could be the reason for a rise in mass protests. In addition, the essay will assess whether grievance theories may play a role in explaining a rise in mass protests by exploring the views of erudite scholars and academics of International Relations, who examine the impact of grievances on protest behaviours. <nl>Firstly, for us to understand and analyse the claim, the term ‘mass protest’ needs to be defined. According to Karl-Dieter Opp (2009), protest defines as a \"joint (i.e. collective) action of individuals aimed at achieving their goal or goals by influencing decisions of a target.\" The motive behind the collective action is \"to draw attention to the grievances; the action is further meant to provoke ameliorative steps by some target group\" (Turner, 1969). Although both definitions are coherent, they fail to deeply define large-scale protests. Ergo, the word ‘mass’ has been added to disclose that the action is carried out by an extensive caucus of citizens. With its causes ranging from basic human rights to economic  social injustice to impoverished government and corruption, the term ‘protest’ is an ‘umbrella’ term for many various forms of expression. <nl>Whether a protest takes the form of a petition (passive protest) or a boycott (direct protest), the sea of protests the world has witnessed leads us to question why mass protests are increasing in frequency. We must understand the catalyst behind mass protests in order to mitigate their effects on the rest of the world. The most evident and plausible explanation for the increase in mass protests would be economic and social inequality. The World Bank (2012) believes that \"Inequality and inequity remain the global genesis of poverty and relative deprivation,\" which further addresses that \"they are the reasons why social movements commence to rebel against unresolved generational disparities and societal injustices\" (Pridemore, 2008). Pridemore’s perspective can be exemplified in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Many within the movement have protested because of the scarcity or denied quality of life aspects (i.e., education, employment, healthcare, housing etc.). In addition, they have been vocal at raising awareness for the social injustice and systemic racism they face when seeing the devaluation of African American lives. <nl>The creation of the movement was influenced after George Zimmerman’s acquittal in the shooting death of African American teen, Trayvon Martin in February 2012. Since its founding, the movement has flourished and gained attention from many around the world who have started social justice protests of their own. This is due to social media’s input which has \"engaged global audiences at unprecedented speed\" (Foer, 2017). The highly publicised murders by police enforcement of Eric Garner (2014), Philando Castile (2016), Sandra Bland (2015) etc. and more recently, George Floyd (2020) stand testament to this. Since the death of Floyd in May 2020, ACLED have recorded over 7,750 demonstrations and protests linked to the BLM movement, across all 50 states in America, as well as other countries, such as the UK. From this statistic, it is right to suggest that we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’ as in this case, the lives of African Americans are being deprived of social justice and racial equality. Hence why deprived individuals within this movement will be more likely to lead to certain protest behaviours. Many theorists such as Klandermans (1997) and Useem (1998) have conflicting definitions of deprivation, but Gurney and Tierney’s (1982) definition is apt in this discussion of social movements. They define it as \"the combination of emotional frustrations and social inequality perceptions that prevent an individual, group or community to thrive within the mainstream societal context\". Their definition puts particular focus on the difference between experienced reality and what is to be expected. In the same way, BLM protesters want economic and social equality but have received the opposite. <nl>Many researchers and theorists have invoked the grievance theory, Relative Deprivation (RD) to explain the phenomena of participating in mass protests and how they interact with deprivation to enhance the protest potential of grievances. For example, Eversley et al. (2017) applies the theoretical framework of the RD theory to explain why inequality and RD incites the BLM movement to protest. In her article, she provides commentary on the four stages of social movements-emergence, coalescence, bureaucratization and decline to highlight BLM’s social movement life cycle. Paying close attention to Eversley’s perception of coalescence (second) stage, in particular, she asserts that BLM use communal and collective action to broadly promote the social injustices endured and establish other coalitions to further protest the movement’s concerns and demands. Her assertion supports the claim as she uses the concept of coalescence to highlight how BLM’s tactics are strategically used which has broadened the movement ‘far beyond its core support’. More importantly what is evident in her argument is that RD plays a role in explaining collective action and thus spurs mass protest. The application to relative deprivation theory further highlights that \"for many Blacks, poverty and relative deprivation are the impetuses why Blacks mobilize to collectively protest against the societal injustices targeted against them\" (Adler, 2015). <nl>Correspondingly, Nigeria’s deprivation of social justice, which is caused by their corrupt governance of state, is another important factor to assess when analysing whether we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’. Runciman’s development of RD (1966) can be employed to explain Nigeria’s cause of mass protests. Runciman uses the concept of social justice centered around RD, to argue that there is a sense of dissatisfaction people feel when they observe other people having something they desire, which is within their grasp but insurmountable. His theory focuses on four criteria for RD. Nonetheless, his first condition promotes that Person A does not have X – hence why Person A may feel deprived and feel the need to protest. This viewpoint is highly fitting and relatable to the #EndSars movement, as Nigerians feel a disconnect to social justice. Nigeria’s lack of capacity in terms of the attainment of effective governance that addresses the issues of corruption and human rights for example is generally traced to leadership failure (Achebe, 1988). In light of this, the feeble governance that is portrayed in many developing countries is at large and thrives in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Economist report, data displays that mass protests have increased annually by an average of 11.5 percent from 2009 to 2019 across all regions of the world, with the fastest growth in sub-Saharan Africa (23.8% global average per year increase). This data is significant as it suggests that the number and intensity of African mass protests have inflated, which reflects \"pre-existing frustrations with social and political conditions that have now been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 restrictions\" (Ramdeen, 2020). For Nigeria, as of recently, their frustrations lie within the government’s incompetence and lack of accountability. As of October 2020, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) caused an outbreak of mass protests. Established in 1992, the purpose of the squad was to combat against armed robbers becoming rampant. However, SARS became controversial after abusing their power by unlawfully killing, harassing, kidnapping, and extorting money from young individuals, leaving them deprived of good governance. <nl>In application to Runciman’s first condition, he exemplifies that deprived individuals, in times of crisis, are likely to demonstrate specific protest behaviours. Despite Runciman’s insight, it could be argued that his theory fails to analyse why some people who are also affected by the cause, fail to act and join social movements in active engagement. From a different viewpoint, deprivation can reduce protest engagement. This is supported by Thomas Kurer (2019), who believes that the decline of citizens’ economic grievances can affect their inclination to protest, however those who experience more deterioration than others may want to mobilise more politically. To some extent, relative deprivation can spur mass engagement in protest activism, however this depends on how much an individual has endured. This can be supported by the idea that there are more youth igniting these mass protests. It is therefore right to suggest that mass protests are thriving in a country where humanity is still relatively youthful and social media is used as an outlet to express their grievances. Social media’s contribution has encouraged countries, such as the UK, to create their own mass protests, shedding their grievances on the issue as well. Their impact accentuates that \"Social media is a way of the voiceless and those that cannot help physically express themselves\" (Wilding et. al, 2018). The inference to be drawn from this is the Nigerian government’s abuse of power coupled with how social media has been used to transmit news across the world, resulting in an uproar of protests. <nl>By the same token, the need for reform in climate change is a motivation behind a rise in mass protests. The Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement in the UK attempt to pursue their goal of compelling action to tackle environmental issues and sought to address the problems of unresponsive government. Arguably, they are deprived of receptive government and thus use direct action tactics (such as collectively blockading bridges and chaining themselves to buildings) to disseminate their views. This is supported by XR’s co- founder, Roger Hallam who argues that \"mass civil disobedience is our only option.\" In a globalized society, the global problem of climate change will not be solved by individual states or even international organizations (Doolen, 2020), hence the need for collective action. Thus, using the theoretical scaffold of Collective Action (CA) Theory (Olson, 1965) can provide reasons as to why there are mass XR protests. Evidently, CA is a powerful motivational push to protest as it encourages participation. This is reinforced by Hayes* (2020) who says that \"Extinction Rebellion seems to have succeeded in mobilising new people.\" ‘Collective identification intensifies feelings of efficacy’ (Simon et. al, 1998). Simon’s notion adds value to the argument as it justifies how effective XR’s active participation has become at garnering media attention. Additionally, the proliferation of social media, despite its offline participation, corresponds with the Habermasian criteria of high accessibility and relatively unrestricted ability to confer (Habermas, 1989). It has generated a ‘global diffusion’ (Della Porta, 2017). This is exemplified in the copious number of environmental protests occurring worldwide - Spain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden- where the nation’s sensation, Greta Thunberg campaigns for ecological change. To summarise, the XR protests have resulted in an uproar of protests due to their collective action and deprivation of responsive governments. The grievances felt from XR protesters portray how the principles and values they place highly are being violated. <nl>Recently, mass protests have become numerous and geographically widespread. Protests have become an escalated global trend and continue to play a role in shaping the political landscape and determining the next cultural, economic, and social decisions. With many notable frustrations around the world currently, effective social media platforms have proven to increase the spread of mass protests. This essay has attempted to critically assess the common causes and themes that arise which garners a reaction and then essentially a protest. The grievance theory discussed has provided valid reason as to why BLM, #EndSars and XR are protesting in masses. ",
      "fixed_text": "\"Hands up. Don’t Shoot!\" \"End SARS!\" \"Go Green!!\" are just a few of the chant slogans many protesters all over the world use. The ample number of protests traversing disparate time zones has caught the attention of academics, critics and communities worldwide. In today’s society, we are witnessing and experiencing is an upsurge of protest. Whether that is in America, Asia, Europe or Sub-Saharan Africa, each continent is living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’. It is right to suggest that there have been recurring themes of inequality, repression and unrest partnered with many failed governments and politics that contribute to this increase. The frequency, scope and size of these protests are considered ‘mass protests’ that have essentially captured media attention, such as those in Britain, Nigeria and North America. Although each protest has a unique context and cause, the common grievances overwhelmingly draw on the opinions and viewpoints of feeble and ineffectual governance, nepotism and malfeasance. Thus, the essay will delve into the claim that indeed, we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’ by analysing the root causes of the increase in global protests. These include inequality, corruption and environmental degradation. Social media will also be used to show how fast news spread which potentially could be the reason for a rise in mass protests. In addition, the essay will assess whether grievance theories may play a role in explaining a rise in mass protests by exploring the views of erudite scholars and academics of International Relations, who examine the impact of grievances on protest behaviours. Firstly, for us to understand and analyse the claim, the term ‘mass protest’ needs to be defined. According to Karl-Dieter Opp (2009), protest defines as a \"joint (i.e. collective) action of individuals aimed at achieving their goal or goals by influencing decisions of a target.\" The motive behind the collective action is \"to draw attention to the grievances; the action is further meant to provoke ameliorative steps by some target group\" (Turner, 1969).

Whether a protest takes the form of a petition (passive protest) or a boycott (direct protest), the sea of protests the world has witnessed leads us to question why mass protests are increasing in frequency.

      "raw_text": "An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for chronic health problems, such as obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality traits may make an individual more susceptible to unhealthy eating habits. A personality trait reflects a person’s characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving (Soto, 2018). According to the Five Factor Model of personality, there are five major trait dimensions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN), also known as the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).<nl>Of the five traits, high neuroticism and low conscientiousness have been consistently associated with unhealthy eating behaviours (UEBs). For instance, highly neurotic individuals tend to consume more sweet, savoury and convenience foods (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015) and higher intakes of sugar and fats (Tiainen, et al., 2013). Individuals low in conscientiousness struggle controlling their impulses to eat unhealthy food over a healthier alternative (Elfhag &amp; Morey, 2008). Low conscientiousness has also been found to predict the consumption of foods indicative of an unhealthy diet (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015).<nl>Based on previous findings, it is hypothesised that there will be a significant positive correlation between neuroticism and UEBs, a significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and UEBs, and no significant relationship between openness to experience, extraversion or agreeableness and UEBs. Simply put, individuals high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness will demonstrate more unhealthy eating habits.<nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>A sample of 195 participants was recruited using an opportunity sample.

The dependent variable was food frequency questionnaire scores.<nl>Materials<nl>Big Five Inventory (BFI). Personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008). The BFI is a 44-item, self-report questionnaire that is divided into subscales for each of the Big Five factors of personality (see Appendix A. The inventory consists of 44 brief statements (e.g. ‘I see myself as someone who is talkative’) that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5 (‘strongly agree’). A mean score for each subscale was calculated and some of the items were reverse-scored. The BFI presents an average Cronbach’s alpha of .83 and average test-retest reliability of .85 (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). <nl>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Food consumption was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Hartmann, Siegrist, &amp; van der Horst, 2012). The FFQ is a self adminstered, 182-item questionnaire grouped into four different categories; sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat and convenience foods (see Appendix B). The fruit and vegatable category was excluded, as the present study focused on UEBs. These food groups were chosen because their excessive consumption had been shown to cause serious health problems. Participants were asked to report how often they consumed each item. Items relating to sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (‘never’) to 14 (‘several times per day’). Items relating to convenience food consumption were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (‘never’) to 7 (‘daily’). Cronbach’s α was 0.71 for sweets and savouries, 0.69 for sugar-sweetened drinks, 0.69 for meat and 0.71 for convenience foods. Items falling into each food group were summed to reflect consumption frequency of these foods per week.<nl>Procedure<nl>An online questionnaire was created using 44 items from the BFI and 182 items from the FFQ. After providing informed consent, participants were sent an email containing the link to a Google Forms survey. The survey consisted of three separate sections: demographics (gender, age), BFI and FFQ. Upon completion, participants were presented with a debrief page. The raw data set was retrieved from Google Forms as an Excel file. Then, the raw scores were converted into mean scores for the BFI and total scores for the FFQ. For the BFI, negatively keyed items were reverse scored to ensure respondents were providing consistent answers. Items were then coded to the appropriate subscales. A mean score between 1 and 5 was calculated for each BFI trait, by adding up the scores and dividing them by the number of items within that trait. The final data set of demographics, personality traits and eating behaviours was exported to Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2021) for analysis. <nl>Statistical analysis<nl>Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between the Big Five traits and UEBs.

      "raw_text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the enforcement of drastic social distancing measures, which affect the ways in which students interact and socialise with one another. These measures conflict with the human instinct to connect with others, thus increasing social isolation and feelings of loneliness within students (Bavel, et al., 2020). This affects their wellbeing both directly, towards poor mental health and indirectly, as the underpinning reason behind the huge reduction in social interaction that students must now deal with (Burns, Dagnall, &amp; Holt, 2020). The objective of this research is to gain an insight into the importance of social interactions on the wellbeing of students, and how this has been impacted due to Covid-19. The main research question was therefore: ‘How have changes in the amount and quality of social interactions due to COVID-19 impacted the well-being of undergraduate students?’. Through this, a semi-structured interview was developed, which aimed to investigate the experience of changed social interactions, the impact this had on participant wellbeing, and their experience of coping mechanisms.<nl><nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) has been chosen as the most appropriate methodology for this research topic because it is concerned with the detailed examination of the participant’s personal lived experience (Willig &amp; Stainton Rogers, 2017).<nl>Analysis<nl>1 \"It’s overwhelming and draining\": negative impacts on wellbeing<nl>This superordinate theme explores the significant physical and psychological toll Covid-19 has taken on Feya, fostering a sense of powerlessness. She discusses the loss of control, predictability and security within her life during these unprecedented times.<nl>1.1 \"…I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel\": depressive symptoms<nl>Here, Feya uses a metaphoric expression, of being in a tunnel with no light, to illustrate the sense of loss of control she feels over her life and the feeling that there is no way out of this ordeal. She sees no light, which otherwise symbolises hope, at the end of this dark, perpetual tunnel, that is her mind. This is further supplemented by her mention of feeling \"trapped\", which implies that she feels imprisoned by her own thoughts and is looking for an escape. Feya appears to be discontent with life and tired of \"staring at the same four walls everyday\". This is reiterated when she states that she is \"living the same day, every day\". She feels stuck, defeated and hopeless. This creates a powerful, cyclical imagery of her depressive thoughts as being inescapable, as she goes over the same worries over and over.<nl>\"…I feel really lonely, and a bit depressed and sluggish […] I feel like I’m locked in a box.\"<nl>Feya talks about the negative emotions felt amidst lockdown restrictions. The box Feya describes is a metaphorical representation of the confinements within her own mind, as well as the physical confinements within her home. She highlights being mentally drained and avidly waiting for lockdown to come to an end. Feya’s use of the phrase ‘mentally drained’ implies she is emotionally depleted and burnt-out due to the accumulation of stress in her personal life. In addition, Feya reiterates her fear of being ‘lonely\" later on, saying \"I feel like you have to go out and see people, otherwise […] you’ll drive yourself crazy\". This conveys her anxiety of being left alone to fight all of these overwhelming feelings by herself. The loneliness makes her feel vulnerable.<nl>Feya describes the bodily symptoms of depression, such as a loss of appetite and insomnia, which denotes how her feelings have clearly wreaked havoc on her physical wellbeing:<nl>\"When I’m drained, my appetite disappears, I can’t sleep and my mood’s just dull\"<nl>Feya describes the sudden, erratic nature of her sadness. The way her appetite ‘disappears’ without warning suggests that symptoms are unpredictable and out of her control. Her inability to sleep shows how overwhelming this experience is, as her mind is constantly racing with negative thoughts, to the extent where she feels disorientated. The use and repetition of the verb ‘drained’ connotes a powerful imagery of a pale, empty shell of a person, highlighting the invasive, destructive effects as a result of being in isolation.<nl>1.2 \"I’ve been so anxious about the future, because life as we know it, has changed\": anxious symptoms<nl>Within this superordinate theme, Feya alludes to her apprehensions about what the future holds post-pandemic. She is filled with apprehensions and worries. Feya talks about going through a \"really uncertain time\", most of which revolves around her professional and personal life. She expresses an unknowingness of \"all of this is going to be over\". The pronoun ‘all’ denotes that the current crisis has impacted every aspect of her life. It depicts the true extent of the impact of Covid-19. Feya expresses how powerless she feels:<nl>\"We can’t plan things out anymore\" <nl>Feya refers to the lack of control she feels, as her \"many plans and aspirations\" have been compromised. The use of the collective pronoun, ‘we’, denotes a sense of unity and acts as an attempt to regain a sense of control. It provides Feya with a sense of reassurance, that she is not the only one going through these hardships. She paints a picture of herself as being powerless, with no choice but to surrender to the virus. <nl>This is further exacerbated when Feya appears to be thinking out loud, searching for the answers to her many questions: \"Are we going back into lockdown, are we not, can we go into work, can we go to restaurants and see our friends?\" Feya is clearly stuck in her ruminations, which is an expression of her doubt and uncertainty regarding what the future holds.<nl>Feya describes the significant psychological distress she faced, induced by the abrupt nature of lockdown restrictions:<nl>\"I- I- I was really scared and cautious and careful\"<nl>The repetition of \"I\", where Feya appears to stumble over her words, sounds robotic and reflects how overwhelmed she felt at the time. There is a strong sense of fear and anxiety, depicted through her selection of words.<nl><nl>2 \"I felt so distant from them\": changes in social interactions<nl>This superordinate theme reflects the changes in Feya’s social habits and ways of social interaction. Feya describes feeling not only physically distant from her friends, but also emotionally. She complains about how they \"wouldn’t even be awake at the same time\", which creates a barrier that even digital interactions can’t overcome. She feels emotionally detached and isolated, indicating a clear disconnect with the outside world due to the Covid-19 crisis. This is further emphasised when Feya talks about losing the ability to socialise, saying she had \"forgot what it was like to even talk to friends\", which implies that being in social isolation had stifled her.<nl><nl>2.1 \"With your immediate family members who you’re living with, you get sick of and start bickering\": interpersonal tensions<nl>Here, Feya states how confinement with family members in her household has led to inevitable interpersonal tensions, as a result of stress and spending so much time together. The verb ‘bickering’ implies that they argue over trivial matters, which suggests that her ‘dull’ moods not only impact her own wellbeing but are also displaced onto others. <nl><nl>2.2 \"If it wasn’t for social platforms, I don’t know what I’d do\": shift from physical to digital communication<nl><tab>Feya describes social media as being an essential tool used to stay in contact with her friends and family. She explains that maintaining ties has \"moved from a physical form […] to a digital form\" and that everyone is just \"a call away\" now. <nl><tab>Though she expresses her gratitude for these platforms, she says it does not compare to face-to-face contact. This emphasises how important physical connection is to Feya – it’s a love language, which makes her feel ‘alive’ and connected.<nl><nl>3 \"I’m pretty distracted most of the time\": coping mechanisms amid pandemic<nl>The final superordinate theme portrays how Feya is coping with the pandemic. Feya talks about being a key-worker alongside a university student, so she feels that she hasn’t felt the impacts of the pandemic as severely as others. The adjective ‘distracted’ suggests she hasn’t truly dealt with the impacts of the pandemic, instead she has diverted her attention and energy towards studies and work to avoid reality.<nl><nl>3.1 \"I’ve just got to get on with it really\": acceptance<nl><tab>Here, Feya’s tone implies that she is ready to accept the uncontrollable nature of the Covid-19 virus and wants to proceed forward with her life, despite the turmoil it has caused. Acceptance is where the power lies, as Feya is able to find the control that she had previously lacked.<nl><nl>3.2 \"It’s enjoyable, it’s what life is about really\": maintaining close ties<nl>Here, Feya insinuates the importance of interpersonal connections through her use of language. She uses words which highlight the warmth that she feels in the company of her friends and describes how her mood ‘brightens up’ in their presence. She denotes the importance to continuously attend to and nurture her relationships in order to live a meaningful life.<nl>She talks about how seeing her friends has had a really positive impact on her mental health. She adds that she doesn’t feel \"as alone\" in their company, which shows how social interactions provide a sense of unity, ease and comfort. They provide her with reassurance that she’s not the only one going through these difficult times.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the social connectedness and wellbeing of Feya. She defines her experience of lockdown as being overwhelming, draining and uncertain, as a result of social distancing measures, university closures and reduced social contact. During the course of the interview, we see a shift from frustration to acceptance of the global pandemic, as she is forced to come to terms with reality.",

Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) has been chosen as the most appropriate methodology for this research topic because it is concerned with the detailed examination of the participant’s personal lived experience (Willig and Stainton Rogers, 2017). Analysis 1 \"It’s overwhelming and draining\": negative impacts on wellbeing This superordinate theme explores the significant physical and psychological toll Covid-19 has taken on Feya, fostering a sense of powerlessness. She discusses the loss of control, predictability and security within her life during these unprecedented times. 1.1 \"…I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel\": depressive symptoms Here, Feya uses a metaphoric expression, of being in a tunnel with no light, to illustrate the sense of loss of control she feels over her life and the feeling that there is no way out of this ordeal.

This is further exacerbated when Feya appears to be thinking out loud, searching for the answers to her many questions: \"Are we going back into lockdown, are we not, can we go into work, can we go to restaurants and see our friends?\" Feya is clearly stuck in her ruminations, which is an expression of her doubt and uncertainty regarding what the future holds. Feya describes the significant psychological distress she faced, induced by the abrupt nature of lockdown restrictions: \"I- I- I was really scared and cautious and careful\" The repetition of \"I\", where Feya appears to stumble over her words, sounds robotic and reflects how overwhelmed she felt at the time. There is a strong sense of fear and anxiety, depicted through her selection of words. 2 \"I felt so distant from them\": changes in social interactions This superordinate theme reflects the changes in Feya’s social habits and ways of social interaction.

This is further emphasised when Feya talks about losing the ability to socialise, saying she had \"forgot what it was like to even talk to friends\", which implies that being in social isolation had stifled her. 2.1 \"With your immediate family members who you’re living with, you get sick of and start bickering\": interpersonal tensions Here, Feya states how confinement with family members in her household has led to inevitable interpersonal tensions, as a result of stress and spending so much time together. The verb ‘bickering’ implies that they argue over trivial matters, which suggests that her ‘dull’ moods not only impact her own wellbeing but are also displaced onto others. 2.2 \"If it wasn’t for social platforms, I don’t know what I’d do\": shift from physical to digital communication Feya describes social media as being an essential tool used to stay in contact with her friends and family. She explains that maintaining ties has \"moved from a physical form […] to a digital form\" and that everyone is just \"a call away\" now. Though she expresses her gratitude for these platforms, she says it does not compare to face-to-face contact. This emphasises how important physical connection is to Feya – it’s a love language, which makes her feel ‘alive’ and connected. 3 \"I’m pretty distracted most of the time\": coping mechanisms amid pandemic The final superordinate theme portrays how Feya is coping with the pandemic. Feya talks about being a key-worker alongside a university student, so she feels that she hasn’t felt the impacts of the pandemic as severely as others. The adjective ‘distracted’ suggests she hasn’t truly dealt with the impacts of the pandemic, instead she has diverted her attention and energy towards studies and work to avoid reality. 3.1 \"I’ve just got to get on with it really\": acceptance Here, Feya’s tone implies that she is ready to accept the uncontrollable nature of the Covid-19 virus and wants to proceed forward with her life, despite the turmoil it has caused. Acceptance is where the power lies, as Feya is able to find the control that she had previously lacked. 3.2 \"It’s enjoyable, it’s what life is about really\": maintaining close ties Here, Feya insinuates the importance of interpersonal connections through her use of language. She uses words which highlight the warmth that she feels in the company of her friends and describes how her mood ‘brightens up’ in their presence. She denotes the importance to continuously attend to and nurture her relationships in order to live a meaningful life. She talks about how seeing her friends has had a really positive impact on her mental health. She adds that she doesn’t feel \"as alone\" in their company, which shows how social interactions provide a sense of unity, ease and comfort. They provide her with reassurance that she’s not the only one going through these difficult times. Conclusion Dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the social connectedness and wellbeing of Feya. She defines her experience of lockdown as being overwhelming, draining and uncertain, as a result of social distancing measures, university closures and reduced social contact. During the course of the interview, we see a shift from frustration to acceptance of the global pandemic, as she is forced to come to terms with reality."

(2019) showed a mean of 1051.93 milliseconds (ms) in the English version incongruent condition which was 54.8 ms slower than the Hindi version in condition 3 (997.13 ms) and 151.63 ms slower when comparing to the English version in Condition 2 (900.30 ms). These researchers found that incongruent trials took longer to respond to than congruent trials, therefore the prediction for this study was that students would take longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than reacting to stimuli in the congruent condition. Method Design The experiment used a repeated measures design. The independent variable was congruency with two levels - incongruent and congruent. The dependent variable was reaction time measured in milliseconds. Participants Overall, there were 59 participants. All were Psychology Undergraduate students from Aston University and a volunteer sample, recruited through University comms. Apparatus and Materials Participants used personal computers to complete the experiment. This study used PsychoPy to collect data – an experimental software which recorded participants reaction time. The words used were ‘Red’, ‘Green’, and ‘Blue’ (See Figure. 3, Figure. 4 and Figure. 5). The font used was Arial, with the stimuli positioned in the centre of the screen at (0,0). The response options were keyboard arrow keys, left for ‘red’ ink, up for ‘green’ and right for ‘blue’. There were 10 reps to each 6 stimulus types, totalling 60 trials in blocks of 10. Procedure Participants gave consent to participate in the study and took part in the experiment individually. At the beginning of the experiment, participants received written instructions on their monitor. Participants read the instructions in their own time before pressing an arrow on the keyboard to begin the experiment. The instructions described what the participants were to do and which keys they would need to use to respond to the stimuli. (See Appendix 1 for full instructions.). The stimuli were presented on the computer in a random sequence, the words appearing singularly, on the monitor, centre-screen, and only disappearing when participants pressed an accepted key. The experiment ended when all 60 trials were completed. Results Table 1 shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent than colour congruent condition. Both SDs are high relative to the mean, this suggests the data may not be reliable as there are large within condition differences. However, a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant (T = 403.0 , N = 59, p<.001). Discussion Conclusion The results are consistent with the hypothesis of this study and previous research, as participants took longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition – statistically significant. This suggests that reaction time was affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words when attempting to react to the colour (Stroop, 1935; Braisby et al. 2012; Grondin, 2016; MacLeod, 1991). Cohen, Dunbar and McClelland (1990) would suggest that this also illustrates the way people process information and people’s capacity for selective attention. Methodological Issues Due to the way the experiment was ran, participants completed the study not in a standardised environment, completing the study on the different computers or PCs in dissimilar environments. If this study were repeated, participants would use a standard University computer. Also, to verify the demographics of the participants to confirm the ratio of gender and age, as studies has found gender and age differences to response with the Stroop task. (\"What the Stroop Effect Reveals About Our Minds | Lesley University\", 2020). Further Research Further research could include changing the stimulus to test its effects on reaction time. For example, changing the word to be a synonym of the colour (changing red to crimson) or becoming an anagram (red to rde) - like Hintzman et al. (1972); Regan (1978).<nl>Alternatively, changing the colour to a random word (red to ‘ask’, ‘monkey’, ‘heart’, ‘blood’.) (Crannell and Parrish, 1957; \"Stroop effect\", 2020; Posner and Snyder, 1975)."

      "raw_text": "In this essay, I will mention the key features of the psychodynamic approach, such as Freud and the unconscious mental processes, and those of the biological approach – genetics, heredity and evolution. Core assumptions, such as the role of nature and nurture in the key features, will also be remarked upon and compared. This essay will allude to how these perspectives are different, their stands on the nature-nurture debate, and how they are similar – such as the influence of childhood.<nl><nl>The key features of the psychodynamic approach are mostly synonymous to Sigmund Freud, and his research with unconscious mental processes. This approach focuses on the influence of the ‘unconscious’ and how our behaviour as adults is rooted from childhood experiences (Jarvis, 2000). Freud derived theories about the mind and personalities, coming up with theory about the conscious, preconscious and unconscious, how Freudian slips showed what you are truly thinking but trying to hide, and the It (Id), I (Ego), and above-I (superego) (Freud, 1993 as cited in Jarvis, 2000). This means that this approach looks at how past experiences are reflected in current behaviour.<nl><nl>Like the psychodynamic approach, the biological approach has a researcher well known to the field – Charles Darwin. The key features of this approach focus on the role of genetics and evolution. Evolution refers to the way genes in our DNA can change over generations due to the role of ‘natural selection’. Twin studies have been helpful in researchers understanding to the extent genes play a role in behaviour and how much the environment may play a role in this also. For example, twin and adoption studies show how the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher if you are genetically similar than dissimilar (environment also plays a role as concordance is not 100%) - Cardno &amp; Gottesman (2000). This means that this approach focuses on the interaction of genes and the environment - how nature can influence nurture and nurture can influence nature.<nl><nl>A difference between these approaches, is the way that these perspectives view the influence of nature and nurture. The psychodynamic approach concentrates on the role of the unconscious and childhood experiences being the influence on adult behaviour. Therefore, psychoanalysts, such as Freud,, emphasise the role of nurture over nature. In contrast, the biological approach concentrates on the way nature and nurture have a similar influence on each other – the role of genetics as well as environmental influences. <nl><nl>Another similarity with the approaches is that they both have socially sensitive research that have impacted on people negatively. According to Jarvis (2000), in the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists following psychodynamic concepts blamed autism on poor parenting. Tavris and Wade (1997) [as cited in Jarvis (2000)] described a case study that illustrated the negatives of taking a purely psychodynamic approach. This approach is reductionist. Its theories are derived from case studies such as Anna O and the work or Tavris and Wade and it tries to explain everything in accordance to psychodynamic theories. Reductionist approaches included socially sensitive research which as a result significantly harmed people – like the eugenics movement.<nl><nl>The work of Galton, fixated on the role of genetics, influencing the eugenics movement. His focus on certain traits being better in society and the fixation that these traits are hereditary only led to the research being abused and hurting thousands of people (Fairholm, 2011). Eugenics was very popular to begin with but eventually it led to a way to discriminate, segregate and sterilise (,and in Nazi Germany, systematically murder) millions of people deemed to have undesirable genes. This dark side of psychology was reductionist and ethically immoral. The eugenics movement attempted to use just genes to explain everything about people. As a result, by focusing only on genes and inheritance, the importance of the environment was ignored (Fairholm, 2011). <nl><nl>Neurodevelopmental disorders show that genes are not the only factor to developing a disorder, for example, while Fragile X Syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome are not hereditary (passed from parents to offspring) even though its genetic, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is purely environmental – no genetic origin. (Witton, C., 2019). This means that separating genes and the environment is not appropriate as neurodevelopmental disorders here show that nature has influence over nurture (Fragile X Syndrome) and nurture has influence over nature (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome).<nl><nl>The understanding developed from biological theories and discoveries has aided in pharmacological treatment for psychological disorders and the potential understanding on how these disorders develop. The discovery of neurones (by von Waldeyer-Hartz) and eventual discovery of the Synapse (by Sir Charles Sherrington) led to the unearthing of neurotransmitters and their functions – and their influence on the brain and psychological disorders such as serotonin with depression. This has led to biopsychology to be considered scientific due to objective and controlled research.<nl><nl>Similar to this, Freudian theory on ego defences such as displacement, denial and projection are considered today in psychodynamic therapy. These are considered in therapy as psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, see psychological problems as rooted in childhood and dealing with the root cause, and gaining insight into trauma, can help relieve symptoms. An example of this used in the past would be the case study of Anna O – bringing trauma into the consciousness by talking about it resolved the symptoms of her hysteria. However, this approach includes vague untestable concepts that lack specifics required to assist in Psychology being considered a science. For example, the Oedipus Complex is almost impossible to measure and the use of case studies, such as Anna O reduces the validity of this approach and it being scientific as participants are not typical of the population. (Jarvis, 2000)<nl><nl>Anna O is a case study in the psychodynamic approach which focused on how the mind served to adapt the individual to the environment. The mind presents hysteria to unresolved trauma, the mind adapting the individual to its environment and past experiences. Based on this, I suggest that psychodynamic approach has functionalist perspectives. However, with Freud’s insistence of interpreting and analysing dreams, this approach has certain structuralist qualities. The psychodynamic philosophy analyses the mind based on behaviour that presents itself, such as Freudian slips and dreams, which is partially what structuralism is based upon. Therefore, the psychodynamic approach is an interaction of functionalism and structuralism with a lean towards functionalism.<nl><nl>Similarly, the biological approach can be viewed to be an interaction of structuralism and functionalism. The approach analyses the mind and localises areas for specific jobs, such as with genetics and chromosome x or y on the last pair which determines gender or Broca’s area for speech aphasia. This is structuralist. Where this approach links with functionalism is through evolution. Where the mind has adapted an individual to their environment. This is evident with evolutionary fears – such as fear of heights, the dark and snakes. This behaviour increased survival in the past. Another example of this is the cuteness of babies. This is also a survival factor as infants are unable to look after themselves. As a result, this ‘cuteness’ factor elicits a caregiving response and the need to look after infants and protect them from the dangers. (Kringelbach, Stark, Alexander, Bornstein &amp; Stein, 2016).<nl><nl>A similarity between the biological and psychodynamic approach are that both are deterministic approaches rather than demonstrating free will in their theories. While the biological approach approaches the nature and nurture debate as it being an interaction between the two, it is largely a deterministic approach rather than free will. Biological determinism is where biological concepts or processes determine our thoughts and behaviours (Fairholm, 2011). This approach rejects a total genetic viewpoint, especially because of the eugenics movements, but elements of this approach is still deterministic. An example would be the argument for the MAOA gene and aggression. Some have argued in the past that because one may have this gene and commit and act of aggression, this excuses their behaviour. However, this cannot be accepted in the current Criminal Justice system and that people must take responsibility for their actions as other people with this gene can control their aggression (Holmgren &amp; Winterdyk, 2011). This example shows that the biological approach focuses on deterministic theories rather than free will.<nl><nl>Moreover, the psychodynamic approach leans more on determinism than free will. This is evident in the fact that Freudian concepts argue that behaviour in the current is influenced by past experiences in childhood. This leaves little room for free will as a result. Another example is through the ego defences suggested by Freud. These are considered an automatic phenomenon to protect a person from their trauma, for example repression of trauma or displacing anger from the object of their anger to someone more vulnerable – the person isn’t aware they are doing this consciously. Therefore, this removes the aspect of free will.<nl><nl>At first glance, one would assume that the biological approach and the psychodynamic approach are different, that because one focuses on genetics and evolution and the other focuses on early childhood experiences and the unconscious, that there are no similarities. However, this essay shows that, aside from the basic key features, the perspectives are more similar than first assumed. They have people that are well known to their areas – Freud and Darwin. Furthermore, both indicate that childhood has influence over behaviour – the unconscious desire and fears presented in Freudian theory and environmental influences on typical body development (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). There are differences in the perspectives, such as the psychanalytical approach considering nurture to have more influence but the biological  approach considering the interaction of nature and nurture having equal amount of effect on behaviour. In conclusion, the biological and psychodynamic are much more similar than what would first be assumed.",

Various research has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting within child development, concerning parent rearing styles, socioeconomic background, alongside the demands which come with parenthood.  <nl>Research into parenting styles has helped in our understanding of parenting on child development, about investigating the relationship between the type of occupation depended on social class and parenting styles. As white-collar workers require the individual to deal more with the creative ideas, symbols, and interpersonal realities, whilst blue-collar workers are required to conform to external standards such as orderliness, neatness, and obedience (Gecas &amp; Nye, 1974; Kohn, 1969). From these contrasting two occupations research suggests that this essentially has influence in child-rearing styles to the child development concerning the socialisation of the child within society, alongside with their identity and values; as those of a lower-class may emphasise obedience and respect to authority to their children in comparison to middle-upper class parents who may encourage initiative, curiosity, and creativity to their child (Greenberger, O’Neil,&amp; Nagel, 1994).<nl>This research evidence can be perceived as reliable in contributing to our understanding of the indirect impact of parenting on child development, as various studies also support the notion of socioeconomic status influencing parenting and child development. This is evident as research shows that poor conditions within the workplace such as a busy day, high workload, and higher job demands are related to poor parenting behaviour (Repetti 1992, 1994). This is further supported by research by Repetti et al, (1991) which showed that fluctuations in job stressors experienced by male air traffic controllers contributed to the absence of the father, this consisted of fewer high involvement interactions and less monitoring and help with the children’s schoolwork.  Simultaneously, mothers with a variety of occupational status and heavy workloads also have less involvement and more withdrawal from children.<nl>Moreover, it can also be argued that this research aids in our understanding, as it does not have a bias about the role of father as solely a breadwinner but values the importance of father and child interaction in the development of the child. This non-traditional family approach to investigating the relationship between parenting and child development increases the mundane realism of the findings with today’s society with variations in family dynamics; especially with the consideration of the crucial role of the father in a child’s development.<nl>Baumrind's (1967) three patterns of parenting styles Authoritarian, Permissive, and Authoritative has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting on child development. Glasgow et al (1997) state that ‘Authoritarian parents are highly demanding and unresponsive’; this consists of the parent attempting to control and mould the behaviour of their children according to a set standard. This parenting style has increased our understanding with the supporting evidence which shows its effect on child development. As evidence shows that children from authoritarian families more prone to levels of perfectionism, critical attitudes, and anxiety (Randall, Bohner, &amp; Travers, 2015), alongside low academic achievement.  <nl>The second parenting style is authoritative parenting this consists of maintaining an effective balance between high levels of demandingness and responsiveness, alongside being warm and supportive parents. This style is found to be the most effective parenting style concerning school achievement. As a result of encouraging bidirectional communication between both the child and parent (Glasgow et al., 1997, p.508). In addition to this, the warm and affectionate relationship between children and parents promote cognitive growth in children (Maccoby &amp; Martin, 1983; Baumrind, 1973, 1979).<nl>The final parenting style is Permissive, this consists of a ‘more responsive than they are demanding approach’, therefore leading to little or no discipline for the child. This style has contributed to the impact of this parenting on child development. This is apparent within the findings of Sahithya, et al. (2020) which illustrated that a significant association with permissive parenting style and the sociability and emotionality of the child, alongside increased anxiety levels.<nl>These parenting styles can be seen as effective with the supporting evidence in regard to it touching all the spheres of the child development such as school achievement, mental health, and the socialisation the child, in comparison to adopting a narrow approach on child development such as the child’s behaviour alone.<nl>However, it can be argued that there is a cultural bias within the research of parenting styles with its influence on child development.  As cultures may perceive a parenting style as a more favourable and beneficial contribution to their child development; Authoritarian parenting in Asian cultures is perceived as more effective as they hold the belief that tough love leads to success (You &amp; Malley-Morrison 2000). Therefore, from this it can be argued that based upon various cultural viewpoints on parenting styles it will be difficult to see the impact of parenting styles within a child’s development as there appears to be no distinct correct style of parenting. <nl>Finally, it can also be argued that a parent’s mental health may also have influenced a child’s development. This is apparent based upon the difficulties that come with parenthood, such as sleep deprivation, finical stress, strained partner relationship (Nelson et al.,2014); essentially affecting the wellbeing of the parent affects the child’s development. This is further supported by Goodman et al, (2011) which found that there was an association between maternal depression and a child’s negative behaviour and psychopathology.  <nl>To conclude, it is evident that there is an association between parenting and child development, with the influence on parenting styles, the socio-economic status of the parent, alongside with the well-being of the parent.

What do I need to do now to confirm going into my final year and how do I select which modules I want to take? Thanks in advance, ."

      "raw_text": "Both the biological and psychoanalytic approaches seek to explain human behaviour. The biological approach proposes the idea that all psychological problems are rooted in physiological causes, whereas the psychoanalytic approach suggests that behaviour is due to unconscious forces and childhood experiences. The key features of these approaches are distinct from each other and have their uses and limitations, yet, both are still widely used in psychology. <nl><nl>The biological approach prevails over other psychological approaches due to the fact that its explanations encompass anatomy, physiology and the role of neurological function. This approach accepts the idea of materialism as it assumes that all behaviour has a physical basis. This opposes the previously accepted idea of dualism, in which it was believed that the body and the mind are separate but interacting entities. The shift from dualism to materialism was supported with work by Paul Broca (1861). In studying a patient called ‘Tan’, Broca discovered that there was a direct link between the articulation of speech and damage to a particular cortical region. This area was later named ‘Broca’s area’ and pioneered the idea that particular cognitive functions can be localised to areas in the cerebral cortex (Grodzinsky &amp; Amunts, 2006). <nl><nl>Localisation of brain function is a central concept to the biological approach. Broca (1861) and Wernicke’s (1874) findings were some of the first to show that damage to cortical areas produces a change in language. A significant drawback of these findings was that they were concluded from limited post-mortem evidence, which makes it difficult to show the specificity of location. The mechanism of speech may be something that is controlled by multiple areas, so damage to any one of these areas may produce the same effect (Myers, 2007). <nl><nl>Recent research by Delgado and Hamlin (1956) demonstrated how stimulation of the motor cortex using electrodes led to specific physical reactions. In one individual the left motor cortex was stimulated, and it was found that the right fist would clench. This provided support for the latter idea that the cerebral cortex is split into four lobes, each relating to a different function (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). <nl><nl>Another feature of the biological perspective is the idea of brain communication through the use of neurotransmitters. These chemicals are involved in regulating processes in the body such as emotion. If there is a biochemical imbalance in these systems, this may in turn affect human behaviour. A review by Seo and Patrick (2008) demonstrated how a deficiency in serotonin combined with high levels of dopamine interact together in the prefrontal cortex and may predispose individuals to aggressive behaviour. This follows the diathesis-stress model in stating how irregularities in biological systems may predispose individuals to certain conditions which manifest after being triggered. This shows that contrary to general assumption, the biological approach does not entirely ignore the role of nature in human behaviour. It acknowledges that biology may be just the precursor to abnormal behaviour. <nl><nl>Empiricism is an essential component in understanding the functioning behind biological systems. Experiments such as Delgado and Hamlin, (1956) and Seo and Patrick, (2008) show that being deeply embedded in the observational methods of science provides an advantage of the biological approach over others. This level of empiricism means that studies can be easily replicated. Likewise, the possibility of direct manipulation of a variable and the observation of the response means that valid conclusions can be drawn. From this, researchers are then able to take away evidence that helps support concepts such as neurotransmitter effects. <nl><nl>As the biological approach follows the law of parsimony, it often finds itself being criticised for being too reductionist. Complex behaviour is simplified down to individual physiological mechanisms. For example, the concept of being able to produce language is reduced to the interactions between neurones in the frontal lobe when the explanation behind this may be far more intricate. This approach is also deterministic as biological processes are exempt from our free will. If aggression is due to neurotransmitter abnormality, this suggests that there is no control over the behaviour exhibited. However, evidence by Van Lier, Vitaro and Eisner (2007) has shown how peer rejection in children can lead to maladaptive behaviours, including aggression. This demonstrates how an environmental rather than a biological factor can lead to an individual choosing to express their aggressive behaviour. <nl><nl>An alternative to this is the psychoanalytic approach which was developed by Sigmund Freud in 1896. One of the concepts Freud introduced was that personality development is moulded by childhood experiences and fixations, namely the psychosexual stages of development. He theorised that all children go through the oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages in which the individual is focused on obtaining pleasure through the specific areas. In each of these stages, there is the possibility for fixation to occur. If this occurs at any stage, personality development into adulthood may be affected (Fennald, 1997). A second concept is that personality is split into the id, ego and superego which are unconscious forces that influence our decisions and motives. The id contains sexual instincts (libido) and aggressive instincts (Eysenck, 1988). The superego reflects the moral standards of society, restricting the id from making decisions which would not be allowed and the ego is the decision maker, mediating between the two (Jarvis, 2000). <nl>There is substantial contemporary evidence to suggest that Freud was correct in some of his propositions, like his idea of unconscious cognitive processes. Research by Westen (1999) looks to explain how the activation of particular unconscious associative networks influences ongoing thoughts, feelings and behaviour outside our awareness. Westen theorised that when networks associated with a particular situation are activated, this spreads to other neural networks and increases the likelihood of interpreting a situation in a certain way. This supports Freud’s idea by showing how a previous experience, stored in the unconscious, is able to influence future interactions. <nl><nl>The psychoanalytic approach has advantages over the biological approach by taking a multifaceted view and acknowledging both sides of the nature-nurture debate. The role of nature is considered in how innate drives influence our thoughts, and the role of nurture in how childhood experiences elicit behaviour. Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. <nl><nl>The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud’s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. <nl><nl>In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. <nl><nl>The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.",

Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud’s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted."

The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility.

Behavioural economics ‘adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making’ (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a ‘cash transfer to older households’ (Beatty et al., 2014). ‘Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling’ (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that ‘on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel’ (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that ‘positive reinforcement’ ‘can persuade people to make a particular choice’ (Sloman et al., 2018). ‘When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label’ (Abler et al., 2017).

For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health.

      "raw_text": "Pregnancy loss is often silenced and shamed whether it’s miscarriages, termination for medical reasons or stillborn deaths (Keane, 2009). This essay will focus specifically on miscarriages in the first trimester because of the stigma surrounding the validation of mourning a ‘human that didn’t exist’. This essay will also explore the discussions around motherhood, why women feel they are labelled ‘failed mothers’, and recommendations to reduce the stigma around early miscarriages.<nl>Motherhood has been the central and imperative role in a woman’s life. In a woman’s lifetime, she is expected to reproduce in order to fulfil the responsibility of ‘bearers of the collective’. The importance of being the ‘bearers of the collective’ ensures that reproduction allows society to function, and never ‘die out’. Because of this duty, these expectations have shaped women’s identities to believe all women will become mothers. Early miscarriages go against the concept of motherhood, and for this reason, there is stigmatisation around miscarriages. Stigma is defined as an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’ (Goffman, 1963:3), hence the shame and silence around miscarriages. Because of this stigma and duty placed on women, miscarriages deem women to be ‘failed mothers’.<nl>Many women believe they’ll have a successful pregnancy and start to prepare for the new addition. However, not all pregnancies are successful. In fact, ‘first trimester miscarriages are by far the most frequent type of pregnancy loss’ (Layne, 2000:325). When a miscarriage occurs, no one is to blame, however, the blame tends to fall on the woman (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Blame-shifting is a central factor of the stigmatisation around early miscarriages. The blame goes to the extent of the woman also accepting the blame, and believing she was the cause of the miscarriage (Miller, 2015). Moreover, the blame reinforces her inabilities as she renders herself incapable and questions whether something is wrong with her (Miller, 2015; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). A study conducted by Abboud &amp; Liamputtong (2002) found that participants were blamed for their activities which allegedly caused their miscarriage. For example, a participant stated, \"They blame me that it’s my fault, that when I was pregnant, I was dancing, that I wasn’t eating properly. It’s my fault that this happened\" (2002:47). However, according to Sandford Health, it’s essential to exercise to combat the fatigue and hormonal changes during the first trimester (Seitz, 2019). Furthermore, the search for reasoning in early miscarriages causes blame-shifting on the woman, in which she accepts she has failed her duty to be the bearer of the collective, and essentially she is seen as a failed mother.<nl>As aforementioned, the blame allows the woman to accept the moral responsibility of the demise, but realistically she has failed an expectation which is uprooted in intensive motherhood. Intensive motherhood is the philosophy of maximising the potential of a person to become a better version of themselves. In this case, women have adapted to this belief through the understanding of gender roles. Gender roles have set in stone that women are to be housewives and mothers, and from a young age, girls are taught how to cook and nurture. A participant stated that \"the illusion is created not during the pregnancy, but when we are small girls, when we’re still playing with dolls, we already think about being mothers, about children, because it’s in our nature\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:16). The bonding with dolls maximises the potential for young girls to become mothers in the future. In addition, the act of bonding is extended in pregnancy which develops attachment between the woman and the foetus. However, miscarriages interrupt the bonding process that women have adopted since they were young, leaving them confused and empty. The impact of intensive motherhood allows women to develop the ‘picture-perfect’ family idea and believe having children fulfils their purpose of being a woman. In essence, the woman’s identity is defined by her ability to conceive. <nl>The intensive motherhood belief also implies that women have to become mothers, and this contributes to the reason why women try again after a miscarriage to maintain the responsibility of the bearer of the collective. A husband of a participant in the Abboud &amp; Liamputtong study said that \"she kept trying…she insisted…she wanted a boy, like all the other women\" and this was due to his wife feeling she needed a baby to please her husband (2002:54). This implies that miscarriages make women feel they’re inadequate wivespartners, as well as inadequate women, and in order to change that, they must conceive. This also echoes the discussion that motherhood validates a woman’s place in society. Becoming a mother makes a woman an accepted person in society and even in her family home. All in all, intensive motherhood prepares women for the position they play in society – which is to become mothers. Until they do so, they’re ‘failed mothers’ or ‘deviant women’. <nl>Intensive motherhood works symbiotically with the policing of women’s bodies and behaviours. The first trimester of pregnancies is labelled as the ‘risky period’ (first 12 weeks) because this is when early miscarriages occur. For this reason, women are told to not get ‘too excited’ until the first trimester has passed. This period controls the woman’s experience of pregnancy due to biomedical framings. Rothman quoted in Ross (2015) states that ‘demands are placed on women to emotionally distance themselves from the pregnancy, and suspend experiences of attachment to the foetus until ‘it is deemed worth keeping’. For first time pregnancies, holding in excitement is almost impossible, therefore this biomedical framing creates a sense of uncertainty. Shildrick quoted in Ross (2015) argues that women’s bodies have been labelled as inferior. This implies that medical input has superiority over the woman’s body and makes it their obligation to know what’s right for her. Due to the ‘risky period’, women tend to keep the news to themselves and remain quiet about their pregnancy. Additionally, because of stigmatisation around early miscarriages, women refrain from announcing the news of their pregnancy to avoid announcing that they miscarried, and this is to avoid felt stigma and the actual stigma itself. Furthermore, women felt that society’s conventions around hiding a pregnancy until after the first trimester meant they felt alone and isolated in their feelings (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:7). Overall, the biomedical framings have created a scare around the first trimester in order to avoid the stigmatisation of being labelled a failed mother.<nl>Policing of women’s behaviours and bodies has become a routinized process, and women themselves believe every medical input is necessary during the pregnancy. During pregnancy, women are told what to eat and drink, especially at antenatal appointments. Undoubtedly, antenatal appointments have the intention of ensuring the health of the woman and the baby is prioritised, but there are elements of policing and monitoring her behaviours. For a first time pregnancy, up to 10 antenatal appointments are expected, and 7 for those who have had a child already (NHS, 2020), and these appointments ‘feature detailed discussions of women’s behaviours and encouragement to modify those seen as posing a risk to the pregnancy’ (Ross, 2015:330). These modifications allow women to think that if she doesn’t follow these rules, she is the cause of the miscarriage. In fact, most women follow the instructions of pregnancy, yet many still suffer miscarriages in the first trimester. These instructions imply that medical attention plays their part to also maximise the potential of a woman becoming a mother. Over time, women’s bodies have become the embodiment of distrust therefore medical attention during pregnancy is a core contribution to the transition from womanhood to motherhood, to avoid having a miscarriage. In brevity, if these rules are followed, it’s believed there are slim chances of miscarriages, and if they aren’t followed, a woman causes her miscarriage and she is a failed mother.<nl>The ‘risky period’ (12 weeks of gestation) can pose implications that the foetus isn’t an actual human until birth, therefore mourning a miscarriage tends to be unrecognised. The validity of the foetus can be discussed through the concept of foetal personhood. Foetal personhood raises questions in the validation of a woman’s loss as some would regard the foetus as ‘medical waste’. Martel’s study (2014) found that in Canada, pregnancies ending under 20 weeks gestation andor under the birth weight of 500 grams are not registered with Statistics Canada or issued a birth or death certificate. This indicates that foetuses shouldn’t be honoured like newborn babies, due to the fact that ‘miscarriage is not socially recognised in the same way that the loss of a born baby or family member might be’ (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:2).<nl>Medical technologies, such as ultrasounds and sonograms encourage the foetus to be seen as ‘real’, from a foetus to a baby. These technologies allow women to become attached to the foetus, and when the miscarriage occurs, the woman feels a great loss due to the bonding formed in the first trimester, and accept that the pregnancy loss is also real. In reality, some women don’t know they’re pregnant until they take pregnancy tests. They can assume the miscarriage is a delayed period, but the role of medical technologies encourages women to think of their ‘wished-for child as a person’ (Layne quoted in Keane 2009). Similarly, the assumption of the mother role is strengthened by hospital visits and medical technologies because the woman assumes she is a mother. The definition of a mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth to\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2002), and in the case of early miscarriages, this raises questions as to whether the woman who miscarried can mourn as if she were a mother. Nevertheless, whether the woman should be seen as a mother or not, the imagining of the child-to-be should validate her reasoning to feel the loss. The ‘construction of the ‘child’ is created by social actors (the parents) whose identities are shaped by being in a family relationship with them, and without this construction, the ‘child’ cannot exist’ (Mullin, 2015:32). Moreover, Mullin (2015) argues that although the foetus didn’t reach its full potential, it had the potential to do so, therefore the loss of a miscarried foetus should be recognised. Undeniably, the part medical technologies play in foetal personhood reinforces early miscarriages as a failure. The dismissal of recognition for miscarried foetuses further embodies that women who miscarry are failed mothers, as their miscarried foetus isn’t commemorated and is seen as ‘medical waste’.<nl>As previously mentioned, early miscarriages are regarded as medical waste, which invalidates the woman’s grief. The woman’s emotions during and after the miscarriage can be strengthened by her friends, family and medical staff by showing a lack of support, which further emphasises the woman labelled as a failed mother. Bellhouse’s study (2018) found that previous research shows that women affected by miscarriages feel a lack of recognition of their loss, as well as emotional support from those close to them. It is understandable that the woman’s support bubble may not understand her loss, but the emotional distance makes the woman feel alone. Some people around the woman encourage her to ‘get over it’ and forget about it, and urge her to try again. In Gerber-Epstein’s study (2008), a woman’s family had the tendency to insist her to return back to normality and try again. Another woman in the study recalled a doctor saying \"…you’ve got nothing to worry about, you’ll have a bleed in a few days.\" (2008:11). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong’s study (2002), a woman’s husband said \"…the doctor said a couple of weeks and back to normal life and you can have a baby next month\" (2002:47). The lack of recognition of the woman’s grief and healing is prevalent around early miscarriages, which downplays her mourning. These quotes also reveal that women have to constantly work on fulfilling the responsibility of the bearers of the collective, despite what may be going on around them.<nl>Women who have suffered early miscarriages feel shame and embarrassment from their social circle. Some go as far as making insensitive comments and finding the silver lining in the miscarriage. In Bellhouse’s study, they found that \"approximately half of the women expressed feeling that others often did not understand their experience and therefore struggled to empathise with them and support them at the time of their miscarriage, leading to feelings of hurt and disappointment\"(2018:5). People said to a participant in Bellhouse’s study \"oh you know, you’ll get pregnant again’, or, um, ‘oh it was meant to be\" (2018:6). Apart from the insensitive comments, people found ways to blame women for their life choices and activities (e.g. working too hard) as a reason for the miscarriage (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). The shame and embarrassment also extend to women over the age of 30 that miscarry. Although there is no set age for childbearing, it is believed that childbearing rates start to fall low in women over the age of 30 (Noord-Zaadstra, et al., 1991). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong’s study, a participant’s husband stated \"…she was crazy to get pregnant again. In her mind she was too old, and it’s very hard to get pregnant again with her age and menopause\" (2002:53). The woman in the study was between the ages of 37-38, yet she felt she had to prove to her husband her capability to become a mother. Furthermore, this reveals older women experience the stigma of being a failed mother, seeing as they’re nearing the age of menopause. The lack of support from family and friends of the woman suffering from the miscarriage strengthens her label as a ‘failed mother’ as many fail to legitimise her feelings, instead they urge her to try again, rather than allowing her to grieve and heal.<nl>The aftermath of early miscarriages makes women experience feelings such as helplessness, sadness, guilt, irritability, repeated recollection of the experience and fear (Walker &amp; Davidson quoted in Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Many women who experience an early miscarriage feel they’re worthless, disabled, and inadequate (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008; Ross, 2015). During this period, women can become envious of other women with children because it reminds them that they’re failed mothers (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Moreover, women feel they have disappointed themselves and everyone around them. Some women go as far as opting for tubal ligation and adoption seeing as they’re unable to conceive. A woman revealed she and her partner were planning tubal ligation to prevent future pregnancies as she had suffered seven miscarriages (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Similarly, another woman said \"I was already thinking I ought to adopt a child, because I already said I wouldn’t be able to have children\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:15). These women have accepted that they are failed mothers due to the frequency of miscarriages, and settle for alternatives. Women who have experienced early miscarriages often feel scared to get pregnant again, because they feel that their future pregnancies will result in early miscarriages. Overall, these feelings remind women of what they’re not – which is a mother. Early miscarriages also remind them that they have defied the transition from womanhood to motherhood, and they have failed the duty of the bearers of the collective.  <nl>These feelings tend to go unnoticed and untreated by the woman’s support bubble and medical staff, and if left ignored, it can haunt the woman for a long time (Frost, et al., 2007). It’s important that women who have suffered early miscarriages feel they’re not failed mothers, neither are they alone. In regards to family and friends, it’s important for them to speak about the miscarriage so the woman isn’t the only one acknowledging the loss. A woman and her husband found that speaking about the miscarriage helped her grieving process (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002), and women who spoke to other women who had miscarried felt it helped them (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). It’s also vital that the woman’s family and friends are willing to listen to her, and allow her to mourn at her own pace (Bellhouse, et al., 2018; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Creating memories are just as important because it acknowledges the loss, rather than forgetting the miscarriage. A couple found it helpful to take their miscarried babies to their house to create memories and reminders (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Other women found comfort in commemorating their miscarriage through pregnancy loss websites where the miscarried children are represented in the form of angels (Keane, 2009).<nl>Medical care needs to devote time for counselling and support for women after miscarriages to help them process the miscarriage, as well as being sensitive and reassuring (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Women also feel medical care should provide more information and knowledge on miscarriages so women understand how common it is (Frost, et al., 2007; Bellhouse, et al., 2018). In addition, society needs to acknowledge the loss so women don’t feel stigmatised. Suggestions such as public speeches, talks, and medical conferences can lessen the silence around early miscarriages (Frost, et al., 2007). Most importantly, it’s important to stop the blame-shifting onto women who miscarry (Frost, et al., 2007), and to stop the tradition of secrecy during the first trimester of pregnancy (the ‘risky period’). These recommendations will help women know they’re not failed mothers. Educating society and women’s support bubbles will improve the healing process for women.<nl>In conclusion, society’s expectations for women as bearers of the collective has allowed women to believe they’re failed mothers when they miscarry. The culture of blame-shifting contributes to women feeling invalidated until they become mothers. The lack of emotional and physical support following an early miscarriage emphasises the silence and stigmatisation around it. In order to overcome this, more information needs to be provided to society and women affected, to reassure them that they are not failed mothers.",
      "fixed_text": "Pregnancy loss is often silenced and shamed whether it’s miscarriages, termination for medical reasons or stillborn deaths (Keane, 2009). This essay will focus specifically on miscarriages in the first trimester because of the stigma surrounding the validation of mourning a ‘human that didn’t exist’. This essay will also explore the discussions around motherhood, why women feel they are labelled ‘failed mothers’, and recommendations to reduce the stigma around early miscarriages. Motherhood has been the central and imperative role in a woman’s life. In a woman’s lifetime, she is expected to reproduce in order to fulfil the responsibility of ‘bearers of the collective’. The importance of being the ‘bearers of the collective’ ensures that reproduction allows society to function, and never ‘die out’. Because of this duty, these expectations have shaped women’s identities to believe all women will become mothers. Early miscarriages go against the concept of motherhood, and for this reason, there is stigmatisation around miscarriages. Stigma is defined as an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’ (Goffman, 1963:3), hence the shame and silence around miscarriages. Because of this stigma and duty placed on women, miscarriages deem women to be ‘failed mothers’. Many women believe they’ll have a successful pregnancy and start to prepare for the new addition. However, not all pregnancies are successful. In fact, ‘first trimester miscarriages are by far the most frequent type of pregnancy loss’ (Layne, 2000:325). When a miscarriage occurs, no one is to blame, however, the blame tends to fall on the woman (Abboud and Liamputtong, 2002). Blame-shifting is a central factor of the stigmatisation around early miscarriages. The blame goes to the extent of the woman also accepting the blame, and believing she was the cause of the miscarriage (Miller, 2015). Moreover, the blame reinforces her inabilities as she renders herself incapable and questions whether something is wrong with her (Miller, 2015; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). A study conducted by Abboud and Liamputtong (2002) found that participants were blamed for their activities which allegedly caused their miscarriage. For example, a participant stated, \"They blame me that it’s my fault, that when I was pregnant, I was dancing, that I wasn’t eating properly. It’s my fault that this happened\" (2002:47). However, according to Sandford Health, it’s essential to exercise to combat the fatigue and hormonal changes during the first trimester (Seitz, 2019). Furthermore, the search for reasoning in early miscarriages causes blame-shifting on the woman, in which she accepts she has failed her duty to be the bearer of the collective, and essentially she is seen as a failed mother. As aforementioned, the blame allows the woman to accept the moral responsibility of the demise, but realistically she has failed an expectation which is uprooted in intensive motherhood. Intensive motherhood is the philosophy of maximising the potential of a person to become a better version of themselves. In this case, women have adapted to this belief through the understanding of gender roles. Gender roles have set in stone that women are to be housewives and mothers, and from a young age, girls are taught how to cook and nurture. A participant stated that \"the illusion is created not during the pregnancy, but when we are small girls, when we’re still playing with dolls, we already think about being mothers, about children, because it’s in our nature\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:16). The bonding with dolls maximises the potential for young girls to become mothers in the future. In addition, the act of bonding is extended in pregnancy which develops attachment between the woman and the foetus. However, miscarriages interrupt the bonding process that women have adopted since they were young, leaving them confused and empty. The impact of intensive motherhood allows women to develop the ‘picture-perfect’ family idea and believe having children fulfils their purpose of being a woman. In essence, the woman’s identity is defined by her ability to conceive. The intensive motherhood belief also implies that women have to become mothers, and this contributes to the reason why women try again after a miscarriage to maintain the responsibility of the bearer of the collective. A husband of a participant in the Abboud and Liamputtong study said that \"she kept trying…she insisted…she wanted a boy, like all the other women\" and this was due to his wife feeling she needed a baby to please her husband (2002:54). This implies that miscarriages make women feel they’re inadequate wivespartners, as well as inadequate women, and in order to change that, they must conceive. This also echoes the discussion that motherhood validates a woman’s place in society. Becoming a mother makes a woman an accepted person in society and even in her family home. All in all, intensive motherhood prepares women for the position they play in society – which is to become mothers. Until they do so, they’re ‘failed mothers’ or ‘deviant women’. Intensive motherhood works symbiotically with the policing of women’s bodies and behaviours. The first trimester of pregnancies is labelled as the ‘risky period’ (first 12 weeks) because this is when early miscarriages occur. For this reason, women are told to not get ‘too excited’ until the first trimester has passed. This period controls the woman’s experience of pregnancy due to biomedical framings. Rothman quoted in Ross (2015) states that ‘demands are placed on women to emotionally distance themselves from the pregnancy, and suspend experiences of attachment to the foetus until ‘it is deemed worth keeping’. For first time pregnancies, holding in excitement is almost impossible, therefore this biomedical framing creates a sense of uncertainty. Shildrick quoted in Ross (2015) argues that women’s bodies have been labelled as inferior. This implies that medical input has superiority over the woman’s body and makes it their obligation to know what’s right for her. Due to the ‘risky period’, women tend to keep the news to themselves and remain quiet about their pregnancy. Additionally, because of stigmatisation around early miscarriages, women refrain from announcing the news of their pregnancy to avoid announcing that they miscarried, and this is to avoid felt stigma and the actual stigma itself. Furthermore, women felt that society’s conventions around hiding a pregnancy until after the first trimester meant they felt alone and isolated in their feelings (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:7). Overall, the biomedical framings have created a scare around the first trimester in order to avoid the stigmatisation of being labelled a failed mother. Policing of women’s behaviours and bodies has become a routinized process, and women themselves believe every medical input is necessary during the pregnancy. During pregnancy, women are told what to eat and drink, especially at antenatal appointments. Undoubtedly, antenatal appointments have the intention of ensuring the health of the woman and the baby is prioritised, but there are elements of policing and monitoring her behaviours. For a first time pregnancy, up to 10 antenatal appointments are expected, and 7 for those who have had a child already (NHS, 2020), and these appointments ‘feature detailed discussions of women’s behaviours and encouragement to modify those seen as posing a risk to the pregnancy’ (Ross, 2015:330). These modifications allow women to think that if she doesn’t follow these rules, she is the cause of the miscarriage. In fact, most women follow the instructions of pregnancy, yet many still suffer miscarriages in the first trimester. These instructions imply that medical attention plays their part to also maximise the potential of a woman becoming a mother. Over time, women’s bodies have become the embodiment of distrust therefore medical attention during pregnancy is a core contribution to the transition from womanhood to motherhood, to avoid having a miscarriage. In brevity, if these rules are followed, it’s believed there are slim chances of miscarriages, and if they aren’t followed, a woman causes her miscarriage and she is a failed mother. The ‘risky period’ (12 weeks of gestation) can pose implications that the foetus isn’t an actual human until birth, therefore mourning a miscarriage tends to be unrecognised. The validity of the foetus can be discussed through the concept of foetal personhood. Foetal personhood raises questions in the validation of a woman’s loss as some would regard the foetus as ‘medical waste’. Martel’s study (2014) found that in Canada, pregnancies ending under 20 weeks gestation andor under the birth weight of 500 grams are not registered with Statistics Canada or issued a birth or death certificate. This indicates that foetuses shouldn’t be honoured like newborn babies, due to the fact that ‘miscarriage is not socially recognised in the same way that the loss of a born baby or family member might be’ (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:2). Medical technologies, such as ultrasounds and sonograms encourage the foetus to be seen as ‘real’, from a foetus to a baby. These technologies allow women to become attached to the foetus, and when the miscarriage occurs, the woman feels a great loss due to the bonding formed in the first trimester, and accept that the pregnancy loss is also real. In reality, some women don’t know they’re pregnant until they take pregnancy tests. They can assume the miscarriage is a delayed period, but the role of medical technologies encourages women to think of their ‘wished-for child as a person’ (Layne quoted in Keane 2009). Similarly, the assumption of the mother role is strengthened by hospital visits and medical technologies because the woman assumes she is a mother. The definition of a mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth to\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2002), and in the case of early miscarriages, this raises questions as to whether the woman who miscarried can mourn as if she were a mother. Nevertheless, whether the woman should be seen as a mother or not, the imagining of the child-to-be should validate her reasoning to feel the loss. The ‘construction of the ‘child’ is created by social actors (the parents) whose identities are shaped by being in a family relationship with them, and without this construction, the ‘child’ cannot exist’ (Mullin, 2015:32). Moreover, Mullin (2015) argues that although the foetus didn’t reach its full potential, it had the potential to do so, therefore the loss of a miscarried foetus should be recognised. Undeniably, the part medical technologies play in foetal personhood reinforces early miscarriages as a failure. The dismissal of recognition for miscarried foetuses further embodies that women who miscarry are failed mothers, as their miscarried foetus isn’t commemorated and is seen as ‘medical waste’. As previously mentioned, early miscarriages are regarded as medical waste, which invalidates the woman’s grief. The woman’s emotions during and after the miscarriage can be strengthened by her friends, family and medical staff by showing a lack of support, which further emphasises the woman labelled as a failed mother. Bellhouse’s study (2018) found that previous research shows that women affected by miscarriages feel a lack of recognition of their loss, as well as emotional support from those close to them. It is understandable that the woman’s support bubble may not understand her loss, but the emotional distance makes the woman feel alone. Some people around the woman encourage her to ‘get over it’ and forget about it, and urge her to try again. In Gerber-Epstein’s study (2008), a woman’s family had the tendency to insist her to return back to normality and try again. Another woman in the study recalled a doctor saying \"…you’ve got nothing to worry about, you’ll have a bleed in a few days.\" (2008:11). In Abboud and Liamputtong’s study (2002), a woman’s husband said \"…the doctor said a couple of weeks and back to normal life and you can have a baby next month\" (2002:47). The lack of recognition of the woman’s grief and healing is prevalent around early miscarriages, which downplays her mourning. These quotes also reveal that women have to constantly work on fulfilling the responsibility of the bearers of the collective, despite what may be going on around them. Women who have suffered early miscarriages feel shame and embarrassment from their social circle. Some go as far as making insensitive comments and finding the silver lining in the miscarriage. In Bellhouse’s study, they found that \"approximately half of the women expressed feeling that others often did not understand their experience and therefore struggled to empathise with them and support them at the time of their miscarriage, leading to feelings of hurt and disappointment\"(2018:5). People said to a participant in Bellhouse’s study \"oh you know, you’ll get pregnant again’, or, um, ‘oh it was meant to be\" (2018:6). Apart from the insensitive comments, people found ways to blame women for their life choices and activities (e.g. working too hard) as a reason for the miscarriage (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). The shame and embarrassment also extend to women over the age of 30 that miscarry. Although there is no set age for childbearing, it is believed that childbearing rates start to fall low in women over the age of 30 (Noord-Zaadstra, et al., 1991). In Abboud and Liamputtong’s study, a participant’s husband stated \"…she was crazy to get pregnant again. In her mind she was too old, and it’s very hard to get pregnant again with her age and menopause\" (2002:53). The woman in the study was between the ages of 37-38, yet she felt she had to prove to her husband her capability to become a mother. Furthermore, this reveals older women experience the stigma of being a failed mother, seeing as they’re nearing the age of menopause. The lack of support from family and friends of the woman suffering from the miscarriage strengthens her label as a ‘failed mother’ as many fail to legitimise her feelings, instead they urge her to try again, rather than allowing her to grieve and heal. The aftermath of early miscarriages makes women experience feelings such as helplessness, sadness, guilt, irritability, repeated recollection of the experience and fear (Walker and Davidson quoted in Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Many women who experience an early miscarriage feel they’re worthless, disabled, and inadequate (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008; Ross, 2015).

      "raw_text": "Creativity is a characteristic of experts in solving a problem, it is an unusual and insightful solution which is of real value which involves the integration of ideas. Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p’s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment).<nl>According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence.<nl>Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982).

      "fixed_text": "Creativity is a characteristic of experts in solving a problem, it is an unusual and insightful solution which is of real value which involves the integration of ideas. Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p’s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment). According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence. Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one’s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments. Wallas (1926) identified 4 stages in the creative process which include; preparation which refers to problem solving, incubation which is yet controversial, inspiration and verification whereby the solution is checked."

      "raw_text": "In this essay I will be making six points in order to assess the UK’s claims to be a ‘climate progressive’ state.<nl><nl>It is argued that the UK is a climate progressive state (Anderson, Broderick and Stoddard, 2020). The UK’s claim to climate leadership is strong and consistent particularly with the development of norms and actions. The UK has also been a key driver of EU climate policy particularly focusing on market approaches which has enabled the EU to meet its targets, as well as developed innovative policy mechanisms such as the Climate Change Act 2008 as well as agreeing to the Paris Agreement 2015. They have been an important supporter of ‘strong climate action both within the EU and in international climate negotiations’ (Dupont and Moore, 2019). Carter argues that between 2006 and 2010, climate change rose rapidly through the UK political agenda and ‘transitioned from low politics to high politics’ (Carter, Neil. 2014). British parties started to compete with one another to be the greenest which resulted in tremendous developments and progress in the 2000’s.<nl><nl>The norms underpinning UK climate policy involves, ambitious target setting, policy innovation and competitive focus on ‘clean growth’. In 2006, the Stern Review stressed that climate change will cause damage of ‘5-20% GDP per year if left unchecked’, however if action is taken immediately then only 1% per year would occur. It stresses that low carbon business opportunities should be followed and that the fight for climate change must be global and cooperative in order to work. This developed into a cost benefit argument, stressing that early mitigation of climate change is more cost effective rather than handling it in the future. The UK government therefore is looking at climate change from an economic point of view not as an ethical or moral viewpoint. Therefore, some may argue that the Stern Review acts as a double-edged sword, it points out the need to for action immediately, however its reasoning and the policy that was drawn after were driven for economic efficiency not the climate itself. The review resulted in a cost effective, market and technology orientated approach to climate change for the UK.<nl><nl>As a result of the findings from the Stern Review,  the UK government passed the Climate Change Act 2008 which allowed the UK to take a leading position in international climate as it was the first country to give a legally binding underpinning to its emissions reduction’s targets. The targets were to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below the 1990 levels by 2050, however now the targets are ‘net zero’ by 2050. These targets are statutory and non–negotiable. This target made the UK a key leader and driver in climate change. These statutory targets are backed by 5 yearly carbon budgets and an independent Climate Change Committee and developed a low carbon transition plan. This policy was a great move for the UK, making it climate progressive by setting out ambitious targets supported by the law. The ambitious climate change policies set out by the UK ‘increases the competitiveness of the UK which encourages innovation and efficiency around the world’ (Bassi, 2016).<nl><nl>The UK has aggressively removed coal from the electricity generation mix, with April 2017 being the first day without coal in 135 years. They established a Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 which aimed to accelerate clean growth and to protect the climate through the rapid phase out of traditional coal power. The UK has also been able to generate low carbon electricity to a share of 52%. The UK also opened the world’s biggest offshore wind farms, using its geographical position as a benefit. As a result, offshore wind power is becoming almost as cheap as onshore wind and the most economically efficient way of generating electricity. This is another factor as why the UK could be argued as a climate progressive state.<nl><nl>However, as the policy developed by the UK were along the basis of economic efficiency and were developed in times of economic growth. Any changes to the economic status would threaten the policies and progressive moves the UK made and become an economic burden. During the economic crash, the Conservative Lib Dem coalition began to roll back on a number of key provisions of the CCA. As a result, the UK are not on track for meeting the legally binding 4th and 5th carbon budgets. They have failed on 14 out of 21 progress indicators which are identified by the Committee of Climate Change as of 2020. Important programmes have been cancelled in recent years, such as zero carbon homes. As a result, there are significant policy gaps between targets and action. Gillard argues the UK present themselves as leading the fight in climate change by setting ambitious targets ‘however, the gap between targets and implementation at the national level has been quietly growing’(Gillard, 2016). Therefore, some may argue that the UK has not been successful with their leadership on climate change.<nl><nl>Another issue that could be argued as to whether the UK is actually climate progressive is to understand what ‘net zero’ means. The CCA 2008 set out to have net zero GHG emissions by 2050. When net zero emissions are calculated, it does not take international aviation, imports, shipping or consumption into account. Therefore, the UK would still be emitting GHG emissions, however, have found ways to mitigate those emissions through things like carbon capture, storage and offsetting. Removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to compensate for the carbon that is being released now. This view on net zero emissions doesn’t really solve the problem. For one it is an indulgence, you are paying to excuse your own sins without changing your behaviour. Secondly, offsetting by planting trees to offset carbon for example, isn’t necessarily practical as it takes many years for that tree to grow and have an effect. This target also doesn’t explain what will happen after 2050 which could become an issue.<nl><nl>UK policy focuses on technological replacement for green growth, however it does not focus on changing norms of consumption or critiquing the idea of economic growth. The UK could be more progressive by attempting to educate and change social norms and perceptions on the way we live. Li and Pye argues that the UK has undergone a transition from export energy focused to market orientated. They argue that there are still lots of transitions required needed in the future (Li and Pye, 2018).<nl><nl>In conclusion, the UK can definitely be seen as a climate progressive state, they have made tremendous efforts in creating measures to limit change, through creating innovative policies which are strengthened by the law, being the first and only major country to do so. Being a key driver of EU climate policy and setting standards in policy for the rest of the world to follow. They will be hosting the Crucial Climate Change Conference in Glasgow 2021 which will give the UK the opportunity to demonstrate its leadership in climate change on the international stage. It could also be argued that the UK’s claims to being a progressive state are fragile and threatened as they are currently not being able to follow through or meet the deadlines set out in the CCA 2008.<nl><nl><nl>In this essay I will be making four points in order to assess the capacity of vegan food practices to provide a solution to the problem of climate change.<nl><nl>The idea of diets and climate change being linked has become a more mainstream idea over the recent years. Shove argues that the current ways of life and patterns of consumption are unsustainable. In order to have an effective response to climate change, new forms of living will have to take place across all of society (Shove, E. 2010). The human consumption of meat and dairy products is a major driver of climate change, with greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production accounting to over 14.5% of the global total (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley, 2014). Livestock production is the largest global source of methane and nitrous oxide and is also an important driver of deforestation which can be seen in the Amazon for example. Bailey et al argues that this is something that has to be addressed in public policy otherwise it will take all the space in carbon budgets especially as the world population increases and as the world population gets richer to ensure everyone has food to eat (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley, 2014).<nl><nl>Ruminant meat has a very large contribution to climate change of between 20 to 25 greenhouse gas emissions (g CO2 equivkcal) compared to plant-based products like wheat and rice which are extremely low (Clark and Tilman, 2017). Research shows that ruminant meat has ten to one hundred times the impact on climate change, land use, air and water pollution compared to plant-based products (Clark and Tilman, 2017). This therefore shows that a large reduction of the consumption and production of meat is needed in order to combat climate change.<nl><nl>The vegan society stated that the number of vegans in Great Britain quadrupled between 2014 and 2019 to 600,000 vegans, however, this is only 1.16% of the population. In order for vegan food practices to have an impact on climate change, a large amount of people would have to change their diets, which would be a rather difficult task. Sociological theories argues that what we eat and how we learn to eat is socially constructed, we learn an appetite or desire for specific goods which reflects our taste regimes. The construction of eating meat is socially normative and is seen as being pleasurable and hedonistic, which we learn and becomes an entitlement as a result of our status and social superiority. Piazza et al (2015) argues that people who eat meat argue it is ‘natural, normal, necessary and nice’. These are rationalizations people use to defend their choice of eating meat.<nl><nl>Similarly, the act of eating meat has attached itself to ideas of masculinity and femineity. Adams argues that manhood is constructed in western culture and society through access of meat eating and control of other bodies (Adams,C. 1995,2015).  Very often preparing certain forms of meat is associated with hegemonic forms of masculinity for example, barbeques. Whereas the production of food is generally dominated by women traditionally. Turner argues that masculinity is presented though what is consumed and in a patriarchal society whereas femininity is presented through what is not consumed (Turner, 2016). Eating meat is a widely established symbol of power, status and masculinity within today’s society. Men are more reluctant than women to endorse meat avoidance and reduced meat consumption out of fears of being seen less masculine. Therefore, in order for a large majority of people to change to a vegan diet, would not only require a change in perceptions of what a vegan diet has on your identity but also the diet would require a change in how society views masculinity.<nl><nl>Addressing veganism as a social practice requires attention to ways of doing things. You have to learn how to be vegan, how to prepare foods but also the importance that it would have on your identity.  Veganism is consciously practicing and is rule bound so those rules would have to be learnt and found throughout society. The mainstream social portrays of being vegan emphasises losing taste, eating bland food and not enjoying it. This portrayal would have to be challenged in order for more people to make a switch to a vegan diet. Recruitment to veganism requires learning, reflection and personal and collective identity work. It is not something that can just happen without any thought. Veganism isn’t just a diet – it’s an identity or even a resistant subculture. Therefore, relying on vegan food practices as a solution to the problem of climate change might be a rather optimistic viewpoint. Ivanova et al argue that ‘a large majority of the household carbon footprints can be mitigated with already available low-carbon consumption options’ and that through ‘challenging current patterns of consumption and societal dynamics through critical assessment of infrastructural, institutional and behavioural lock-ins needs to become a priority for successful climate change mitigation’ (Ivanova et al, 2020).<nl><nl>In conclusion, the capacity for vegan food practices to be a solution to the problem of climate change is large. If we are able to cut down the amount of meat products produced and consumed, it would have a large impact on climate change. However, there are several issues when it comes to trying to implement a vegan diet across society. The social norms around plant-based diets would have to change, societies view on masculinity being centred around meat eating would have to be challenged and the process of becoming vegan may have to become easier or more widely spoken about for example through education. Only then, will it be easier for more people to transition to a plant-based diet for veganism to have an impact on climate change. ",

The idea of diets and climate change being linked has become a more mainstream idea over the recent years. Shove argues that the current ways of life and patterns of consumption are unsustainable. In order to have an effective response to climate change, new forms of living will have to take place across all of society (Shove, E. 2010). The human consumption of meat and dairy products is a major driver of climate change, with greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production accounting to over 14.5% of the global total (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley, 2014). Livestock production is the largest global source of methane and nitrous oxide and is also an important driver of deforestation which can be seen in the Amazon for example. Bailey et al argues that this is something that has to be addressed in public policy otherwise it will take all the space in carbon budgets especially as the world population increases and as the world population gets richer to ensure everyone has food to eat (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley, 2014). Ruminant meat has a very large contribution to climate change of between 20 to 25 greenhouse gas emissions (g CO2 equivkcal) compared to plant-based products like wheat and rice which are extremely low (Clark and Tilman, 2017). Research shows that ruminant meat has ten to one hundred times the impact on climate change, land use, air and water pollution compared to plant-based products (Clark and Tilman, 2017). This therefore shows that a large reduction of the consumption and production of meat is needed in order to combat climate change. The vegan society stated that the number of vegans in Great Britain quadrupled between 2014 and 2019 to 600,000 vegans, however, this is only 1.16% of the population. In order for vegan food practices to have an impact on climate change, a large amount of people would have to change their diets, which would be a rather difficult task. Sociological theories argues that what we eat and how we learn to eat is socially constructed, we learn an appetite or desire for specific goods which reflects our taste regimes. The construction of eating meat is socially normative and is seen as being pleasurable and hedonistic, which we learn and becomes an entitlement as a result of our status and social superiority. Piazza et al (2015) argues that people who eat meat argue it is ‘natural, normal, necessary and nice’. These are rationalizations people use to defend their choice of eating meat. Similarly, the act of eating meat has attached itself to ideas of masculinity and femineity. Adams argues that manhood is constructed in western culture and society through access of meat eating and control of other bodies (Adams,C. 1995,2015). Very often preparing certain forms of meat is associated with hegemonic forms of masculinity for example, barbeques. Whereas the production of food is generally dominated by women traditionally. Turner argues that masculinity is presented though what is consumed and in a patriarchal society whereas femininity is presented through what is not consumed (Turner, 2016). Eating meat is a widely established symbol of power, status and masculinity within today’s society. Men are more reluctant than women to endorse meat avoidance and reduced meat consumption out of fears of being seen less masculine. Therefore, in order for a large majority of people to change to a vegan diet, would not only require a change in perceptions of what a vegan diet has on your identity but also the diet would require a change in how society views masculinity. Addressing veganism as a social practice requires attention to ways of doing things. You have to learn how to be vegan, how to prepare foods but also the importance that it would have on your identity. Veganism is consciously practicing and is rule bound so those rules would have to be learnt and found throughout society. The mainstream social portrays of being vegan emphasises losing taste, eating bland food and not enjoying it. This portrayal would have to be challenged in order for more people to make a switch to a vegan diet. Recruitment to veganism requires learning, reflection and personal and collective identity work. It is not something that can just happen without any thought. Veganism isn’t just a diet – it’s an identity or even a resistant subculture. Therefore, relying on vegan food practices as a solution to the problem of climate change might be a rather optimistic viewpoint. Ivanova et al argue that ‘a large majority of the household carbon footprints can be mitigated with already available low-carbon consumption options’ and that through ‘challenging current patterns of consumption and societal dynamics through critical assessment of infrastructural, institutional and behavioural lock-ins needs to become a priority for successful climate change mitigation’ (Ivanova et al, 2020). In conclusion, the capacity for vegan food practices to be a solution to the problem of climate change is large. If we are able to cut down the amount of meat products produced and consumed, it would have a large impact on climate change. However, there are several issues when it comes to trying to implement a vegan diet across society. The social norms around plant-based diets would have to change, societies view on masculinity being centred around meat eating would have to be challenged and the process of becoming vegan may have to become easier or more widely spoken about for example through education. Only then, will it be easier for more people to transition to a plant-based diet for veganism to have an impact on climate change."

      "raw_text": "Georg Simmel was a classical social theorist interested in alternative social phenomena to theorists like Marx and Durkheim, such as the artistic personality and fashion (Stones, 2007:91). This resulted in Simmel not being taken as a serious social theorist by many academics despite the relevance of his work. The majority of Simmel’s ideas can be regarded as more applicable to modern society than the period Simmel was writing in as the social matters he wrote about, such as fashion, are a larger part of culture in modern society. Simmel’s ideas surrounding the role of fashion in social interaction are valuable in understanding how fashion is important within culture and social interaction in modern society as he argued fashion is functional for social purposes (Gronow,1993:89). Simmel’s arguments allow us to understand how fashion builds social ties within groups and how it allows an individual to express their individuality. In addition, his work allows us to analyse how fashion can help us understand differences between social classes and genders within a modern society by analysing how social groups use fashion as an expression of status. However, although Simmel’s ideas about the role of fashion are relevant today some of his arguments are restricted in their ability to be applied to modern society due to developments within social structure and divisions between social groups since the time he was writing. Nevertheless, his arguments are still valuable to understand the role of fashion in social interaction in modern society. <nl>Simmel believed that fashion was a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541), he argued that individuals imitate the fashion trends set by others which then results in the trend being spread throughout society. His discussion that fashion itself is a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541) is relevant as a certain style does not become a fashion trend until people start to imitate and adopt the fashion trends set by an individual or a brand which then creates a community of followers who all follow the same trends. Furthermore, his ideas are relevant to modern society as people imitate the fashion trends set by influencers and celebrities within the media as they are whom people aspire to be like. Within modern society brands now employ what is referred to as a brand ambassador which is an individual with a following who will advertise certain fashion trends which members of society then adopt and imitate (Calhoun, 2012:372) in order to feel like they fit into society. For example, girls may aspire to imitate the fashion trends set by the Kardashians as they view them as role models or desire to be like them but when too many people adopt these trends new ones emerge and old ones are abandoned. Therefore, it is evident that Simmel’s idea that fashion is a form of imitation is relevant to modern society. However, Simmel then goes on to discuss how this creates a conflict between the need to express individuality and the need to be accepted (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant as the fashion trends individuals chose to imitate are an expression of their individuality but these trends then categorise them into a social group creating a conflict between the need to stand out and the need to be accepted, Simmel later discusses this in relation to acceptance. Consequently, Simmel’s ideas surrounding the role of imitation are relevant to today’s society as people imitate the fashion trends set by those they aspire to be like or those they view as desirable as they want to be socially accepted. <nl>In addition to this, Simmel also discusses how fashion builds social ties through the acceptance and rejection of individuals to social groups. Simmel argues that if an individual adopts the fashion trends of a group that they are trying to gain access to they are more likely to gain acceptance from the ingroup members as they share something in common by carrying the same fashion trends. Therefore, fashion provides a bridge between an individual and a group (Dollhopf, 2011:5) as it helps the individual to build social ties. This is still valuable in understanding the role of fashion in modern society as people within the same social network carry similar trends to each other and are consequently categorised the same way, for example in modern society those categorised as belonging to an ‘indie’ social group are categorised on factors such as the fashion trends they all adopt. However, this argument is only relevant to modern society in terms of the broader social categories people fall into as within the close knit groups people are more likely to associate with there is more diversity in the fashion trends of the group. This can be linked to Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality because within society there is much more emphasis on fashion in relation to individualism rather than fashion as an expression of status. However, although there is a conflict between the need to express ones individuality and the desire to be socially accepted (Simmel, 1957:543) fashion still allows for the acceptance of an individual to a social group as it displays a sense of similarity between members allowing for them to build social ties. Therefore, Simmel’s ideas in relation to fashion as both a facilitator of gaining acceptance into a social group and as an expression of individuality is still valuable in understanding modern society but it must be discussed that although the fashion trends an individual adopt categorises them into a broader social group it does not limit the individual to that social group as there is more emphasis on diversity within groups in modern society. Nevertheless, Simmel’s ideas are still relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society. <nl>Furthermore, Simmel argues that there is a relationship between fashion and social class divisions. He discusses how fashion provides a distinction between the upper and lower classes as it allows for the expression of status against the lower class as the trends the upper classes adopt aren’t as easily accessible to the lower classes due to their economic position. In addition, he also discusses how fashion unifies the upper class by providing them with a collective dominance over the lower class (Simmel, 1957:541). This argument is valuable in understanding the social function of fashion in modern society as we see the continued division between social classes through the fashion trends they can access as the upper classes have the facilities to purchase the upmarket expensive trends of the wealthy whereas the lower classes are still limited to the fashion trends they can buy into, for example brands such as Gucci are more accessible to the upper classes due to their financial status. Simmel goes on to then discuss how once the fashion trends the upper classes have set are adopted by the lower classes the trends will then be abandoned and new trends will be established (Calhoun, 2012:372). This argument is still relevant today as we observe how trends are spread from those of the upper classes such as celebrities and are then adopted by lower classes as the lower market brands start to develop clothing that fits into the upper class trends making it more accessible to the lower classes and resulting in social class divisions based on these fashion trends being less distinct. However, not all trends in modern society stem from the upper classes as we see lower market high street brands setting trends which are then adopted and are easily accessible to all classes. Despite this, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of social class status is still relevant to modern society as fashion is still limited to certain individuals based on their economic status meaning the expensive fashion trends and brands can still only be accessed by the upper classes who have the means to gain access which then creates the social class distinctions based on the fashion trends adopted by each class. Therefore, fashion has a social function of showcasing the differences between social classes and consequently their economic position as once trends become more accessible to lower classes they are then abandoned by the upper classes as they want to maintain the distinction and the dominance they have over the lower classes (Lizardo, 2019). Consequently, Simmel’s ideas regarding social class and fashion are still relevant to modern society although it must be considered that not all trends are started by members of the upper classes and that not all members of the lower class desire to access the trends of the upper class. <nl>Moreover, Simmel examines the relationship between fashion and gender. He argues that fashion is primarily associated with women as it allows them to express their individuality in the oppressed position they are in (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant to understanding modern society as fashion is still greatly associated with women however this argument is limited as fashion has expanded to be more related to men as well as fashion has become important as an expression of individuality for all members of society. Particularly, fashion has gained importance in the lives of young men who take more notice of the relevant fashion trends they wish to adopt. Therefore, although it is still relevant to suggest that fashion is more associated with women as we see in the media that fashion is more targeted at women than men it cannot be denied that fashion has become much more associated with men as well as we have progressed into modern society. Furthermore, the discussion that fashion is one of the ways women express themselves as an oppressed group is limited in its relevance as although women are still viewed as an oppressed group their position in society has greatly improved since the time Simmel was writing in with modern society making a great amount of progress in regards to equality for example with more women in employment. Simmel develops this argument by suggesting fashion accommodates for lack of status women can obtain from employment (Simmel, 1957:551). This argument is outdated as the percentage of women in employment has increased since the time Simmel was writing and as has essentially equalised with the number of men in employment therefore arguing fashion accommodates for the expression of status women cannot access from employment is not relevant to modern society. However, Simmel’s idea that fashion provides a means of expression for women is relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society however it is equally as important as a means for men to express themselves as women but it can be acknowledge that Simmel’s idea that fashion is more associated with women is relevant in modern society as although it has become more relevant in the lives of men it is still primarily associated with women. <nl>In conclusion, Simmel’s ideas about the social function of fashion are still valuable in understanding modern society. His arguments surrounding imitation and acceptance are still relevant as we observe people imitating trends set by those they view as desirable to copy and we see people adopting certain fashion trends to gain access to certain groups. In addition, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality is valuable and relevant in understanding the role of fashion in modern society however his argument that this has a higher importance in the lives of women due to their oppressed position is limited as women have made improvements in their position and fashion has become equally as important in the lives of men. Nevertheless, his discussion of fashion as a means of expressing status between the upper and lower classes is still relevant to society today as we see upper classes starting trends and abandoning them once they are adopted by the lower classes. Consequently, Simmel’s work regarding the social function of fashion is relevant to society today as his ideas are applicable to several areas of society however it must be taken into account that some of his ideas are limited due to the developments made in society from the time Simmel was writing in.

Furthermore, the discussion that fashion is one of the ways women express themselves as an oppressed group is limited in its relevance as although women are still viewed as an oppressed group their position in society has greatly improved since the time Simmel was writing in with modern society making a great amount of progress in regards to equality for example with more women in employment. Simmel develops this argument by suggesting fashion accommodates for lack of status women can obtain from employment (Simmel, 1957:551). This argument is outdated as the percentage of women in employment has increased since the time Simmel was writing and as has essentially equalised with the number of men in employment therefore arguing fashion accommodates for the expression of status women cannot access from employment is not relevant to modern society. However, Simmel’s idea that fashion provides a means of expression for women is relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society however it is equally as important as a means for men to express themselves as women but it can be acknowledge that Simmel’s idea that fashion is more associated with women is relevant in modern society as although it has become more relevant in the lives of men it is still primarily associated with women. In conclusion, Simmel’s ideas about the social function of fashion are still valuable in understanding modern society. His arguments surrounding imitation and acceptance are still relevant as we observe people imitating trends set by those they view as desirable to copy and we see people adopting certain fashion trends to gain access to certain groups. In addition, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality is valuable and relevant in understanding the role of fashion in modern society however his argument that this has a higher importance in the lives of women due to their oppressed position is limited as women have made improvements in their position and fashion has become equally as important in the lives of men. Nevertheless, his discussion of fashion as a means of expressing status between the upper and lower classes is still relevant to society today as we see upper classes starting trends and abandoning them once they are adopted by the lower classes. Consequently, Simmel’s work regarding the social function of fashion is relevant to society today as his ideas are applicable to several areas of society however it must be taken into account that some of his ideas are limited due to the developments made in society from the time Simmel was writing in."

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl><nl>ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by the co-occurrence of impairments in social interaction, communication development and restrictedrepetitive behaviours (RRBs) (Bakhtiari et al (2012). Advances in brain scanning techniques seen in the past two decades (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), has provided a unique opportunity to assess brain connectivity and how differences relative to the neurotypical brain, may contribute to the profile of behaviours seen in ASD.<nl><nl>Underconnectivity theory hypothesises that ASD and its characteristic deficits is caused as a direct result of under functioning in integrative circuitry, that results in an impairment of information integration at neuralcognitive levels (Just et al., 2004).  Just et al (2004) tested this hypothesis, using 17 high functioning ASD individuals compared with typically developing (TD) matched controls, paired on the basis of verbal IQ. All participants completed a sentence comprehension task whilst in an fMRI scanner, assessing functional connectivity between the language areas of the brain. It was found that ASD individuals showed a large systematic difference in distribution of brain activity relative to TD controls, with posterior left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke’s area) activation being greater in ASD and left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area) activation greater in control participants. Furthermore, it was seen that functional connectivity between the language areas in ASD was lower throughout the cortical language systems in comparison to controls. Just et al (2004) suggests these findings have implications for the behaviours seen in ASD, namely atypical strengths in processing single words but deficits in interpreting complex sentences and stories. This may in turn account for the difficulties seen in ASD when interpreting homographs (Happé, 2011). It is speculated that this underconnectivity between cortical regions applies to other higher-level functions. Research assessing theory of mind (ToM), specifically mentalising, in ASD individuals supports this (Castelli et al., 2002). Castelli et al (2002) found that individuals with ASD were less accurate and offered less interpretations during a mental state attribution task relative to controls and that this correlated with reduced activation in the brain’s mentalising network. Despite support from other literature, caution should be taken when interpreting Just et al’s (2004) findings because of its low external validity. Only a small sample size was used, including only high functioning Caucasian individuals, meaning it cannot capture and account for the broad spectrum of ASD and the wider population. <nl>White matter (WM) is key for efficient and synchronised communication between brain regions, underpinning the foundation of brain connectivity (Dean et al., 2016). Research suggests atypical WM microstructure may account for the deficits seen in ASD. Bakhtiari et al (2012) assessed this in ASD participants compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). It was found that ASD participants showed decreased fractional anisotropy values (FA), bilaterally spanning over a large brain region relative to controls, telling of maldevelopment in WM. These decreased FA values in ASD individuals correlated with social and communication difficulties, assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Regions displaying decreased FA in WM tracts included those implicated in emotional face processing (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), language (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and executive function (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, which is linked to attention). A limitation of Bakhtiari et al’s (2012) study is that participants were not screened for other neurological conditions i.e. schizophrenia and ADHD which have also been identified as showing abnormalities in WM, namely low FA relative to controls (Davenport et al., 2010). Furthermore, Bakhtiari et al’s findings do not account for RRBs seen in ASD, with research suggesting an association between high FA values and RRBs (Cheung et al., 2009). This shows that the picture surrounding WM and the ASD behaviours is not completely clear yet and future research should seek to address this.<nl>To conclude abnormal brain connectivity appears to play an integral role in the profile of behaviours and differences in cognitive function seen in those with ASD. Underconnectivity theory arguably provides a robust account of language as well as ToM deficits seen in ASD (Just et al., 2004; Castelli et al., 2002). Meanwhile low FA values, indicative of WM disruption in ASD, can account for impairments in social and communication domains (Just et al., 2004). As mentioned above, DTI literature has also shown increased FA values corelating with RRBs seen in ASD (Cheung et al.,2009).  Some researchers suggest atypical brain connectivity underpins the differences seen in ASD, going as far as to suggest it is the first firm finding in ASD research (see Hughes, 2007).<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurological disorder, defined and diagnosed by the co-occurrence of impairments in communication, social interaction and the existence of restrictedrepetitive behaviours and interests in an individual (Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015). Some researchers suggest that ASD is a fractionable disorder (Happé et al., 2006). Those in support of fractionation argue that there is no single cause for the symptomology seen in ASD and it may be speculated that this is contributing to the ‘lost generation’ of ASD individuals (see Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015) whose needs may not be being met (Happé, 2006). Evidence in support of fractionation theory, largely comes from research into the broader autism phenotype (BAP), defined as subclinical level of ASD symptoms within the general population, that exist outside of the threshold for an ASD diagnosis (Sasson et al., 2013). <nl><nl>ASD is as a highly heritable disorder with estimates as high as 90% (Losh et al., 2009). This genetic liability has been shown by family research to translate in unaffected relatives of ASD individuals as milder, subclinical expressions of the triad, identifiable as the BAP (Losh et al., 2009). Losh et al’s (2009) assessed the BAP in the parents of ASD diagnosed individuals (n=83) using a battery of well-established tasks, measuring ASD symptoms across the triad. <nl>Losh et al (2009) found that of the ASD parents, 22 were identified as positive for social BAP characteristics and 34 identified as positive for rigidperfectionist BAP characteristics. Parents demonstrating social BAP performed significantly less accurately relative to controls on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and similar results were observed across all 6 social cognition measures. However, this was not seen as plainly for tasks assessing executive function and central coherence. This demonstrates the validity of the BAP in parents of ASD individuals and suggest its componential nature, supporting the fractionation of the triad of impairments. However, Losh et al’s research did not control for other disorders such as schizophrenia, which has been proven to have phenotypic similarities to ASD, that also impair social cognition (Sasson et al., 2007). Research seeking to replicate this study should pre-screen for such disorders that could affect ability in tasks, to confirm finding specificity to ASD.<nl><nl><nl>Low to moderate inter-corelations between the triad domains of impairment in ASD individuals has been outlined by researchers as evidence in favour of the fractionation theory (Happé et al., 2006). Conversely, Murray et al (2014) suggests this may be a product of range restriction, underestimating the inter-corelation between traits in those diagnosed. It is argued that studies use of clinical samples represents only the extremes of ASD symptoms because of simultaneous selection in diagnosis, therefore attenuating trait variance and its corelation with other variables. Testing this Murray et al (2014) used a simulation study of 10,000,000 cases showing impairments in all 3 domains, to replicate diagnosis and compared this with real population data from 236 non ASD participants and 148 participants diagnosed with high functioning ASD or Asperger’s. Results showed significantly low inter-corelations between triad domains in the simulation study compared to the population study corelation. It was argued that this demonstrates the attenuation of inter-correlations between traits when simultaneous selection occurs. Murray suggest that investigations of ASD symptom inter-corelations should use both clinical samples and non-diagnosed participants, if we are to assume the characteristic of ASD exist on a continuum within the general population. This conversely suggests that using the general population can serve to facilitate the argument that ASD is a coherent, non-fractionable disorder. With this being said, the use of a simulation to reflect the ASD diagnosis process lacks ecological validity and cannot fully capture the character of the selection process in diagnosis, meaning cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions.

      "fixed_text": "ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by the co-occurrence of impairments in social interaction, communication development and restrictedrepetitive behaviours (RRBs) (Bakhtiari et al (2012). Advances in brain scanning techniques seen in the past two decades (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), has provided a unique opportunity to assess brain connectivity and how differences relative to the neurotypical brain, may contribute to the profile of behaviours seen in ASD. Underconnectivity theory hypothesises that ASD and its characteristic deficits is caused as a direct result of under functioning in integrative circuitry, that results in an impairment of information integration at neuralcognitive levels (Just et al., 2004). Just et al (2004) tested this hypothesis, using 17 high functioning ASD individuals compared with typically developing (TD) matched controls, paired on the basis of verbal IQ. All participants completed a sentence comprehension task whilst in an fMRI scanner, assessing functional connectivity between the language areas of the brain. It was found that ASD individuals showed a large systematic difference in distribution of brain activity relative to TD controls, with posterior left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke’s area) activation being greater in ASD and left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area) activation greater in control participants. Furthermore, it was seen that functional connectivity between the language areas in ASD was lower throughout the cortical language systems in comparison to controls. Just et al (2004) suggests these findings have implications for the behaviours seen in ASD, namely atypical strengths in processing single words but deficits in interpreting complex sentences and stories. This may in turn account for the difficulties seen in ASD when interpreting homographs (Happé, 2011). It is speculated that this underconnectivity between cortical regions applies to other higher-level functions. Research assessing theory of mind (ToM), specifically mentalising, in ASD individuals supports this (Castelli et al., 2002). Castelli et al (2002) found that individuals with ASD were less accurate and offered less interpretations during a mental state attribution task relative to controls and that this correlated with reduced activation in the brain’s mentalising network. Despite support from other literature, caution should be taken when interpreting Just et al’s (2004) findings because of its low external validity. Only a small sample size was used, including only high functioning Caucasian individuals, meaning it cannot capture and account for the broad spectrum of ASD and the wider population. White matter (WM) is key for efficient and synchronised communication between brain regions, underpinning the foundation of brain connectivity (Dean et al., 2016). Research suggests atypical WM microstructure may account for the deficits seen in ASD. Bakhtiari et al (2012) assessed this in ASD participants compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). It was found that ASD participants showed decreased fractional anisotropy values (FA), bilaterally spanning over a large brain region relative to controls, telling of maldevelopment in WM. These decreased FA values in ASD individuals correlated with social and communication difficulties, assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Regions displaying decreased FA in WM tracts included those implicated in emotional face processing (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), language (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and executive function (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, which is linked to attention). A limitation of Bakhtiari et al’s (2012) study is that participants were not screened for other neurological conditions i.e. schizophrenia and ADHD which have also been identified as showing abnormalities in WM, namely low FA relative to controls (Davenport et al., 2010). Furthermore, Bakhtiari et al’s findings do not account for RRBs seen in ASD, with research suggesting an association between high FA values and RRBs (Cheung et al., 2009). This shows that the picture surrounding WM and the ASD behaviours is not completely clear yet and future research should seek to address this. To conclude abnormal brain connectivity appears to play an integral role in the profile of behaviours and differences in cognitive function seen in those with ASD. Underconnectivity theory arguably provides a robust account of language as well as ToM deficits seen in ASD (Just et al., 2004; Castelli et al., 2002). Meanwhile low FA values, indicative of WM disruption in ASD, can account for impairments in social and communication domains (Just et al., 2004). As mentioned above, DTI literature has also shown increased FA values corelating with RRBs seen in ASD (Cheung et al.,2009). Some researchers suggest atypical brain connectivity underpins the differences seen in ASD, going as far as to suggest it is the first firm finding in ASD research (see Hughes, 2007). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurological disorder, defined and diagnosed by the co-occurrence of impairments in communication, social interaction and the existence of restrictedrepetitive behaviours and interests in an individual (Lai and Baron-Cohen, 2015). Some researchers suggest that ASD is a fractionable disorder (Happé et al., 2006). Those in support of fractionation argue that there is no single cause for the symptomology seen in ASD and it may be speculated that this is contributing to the ‘lost generation’ of ASD individuals (see Lai and Baron-Cohen, 2015) whose needs may not be being met (Happé, 2006). Evidence in support of fractionation theory, largely comes from research into the broader autism phenotype (BAP), defined as subclinical level of ASD symptoms within the general population, that exist outside of the threshold for an ASD diagnosis (Sasson et al., 2013). ASD is as a highly heritable disorder with estimates as high as 90% (Losh et al., 2009). This genetic liability has been shown by family research to translate in unaffected relatives of ASD individuals as milder, subclinical expressions of the triad, identifiable as the BAP (Losh et al., 2009). Losh et al’s (2009) assessed the BAP in the parents of ASD diagnosed individuals (n=83) using a battery of well-established tasks, measuring ASD symptoms across the triad. Losh et al (2009) found that of the ASD parents, 22 were identified as positive for social BAP characteristics and 34 identified as positive for rigidperfectionist BAP characteristics. Parents demonstrating social BAP performed significantly less accurately relative to controls on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and similar results were observed across all 6 social cognition measures. However, this was not seen as plainly for tasks assessing executive function and central coherence. This demonstrates the validity of the BAP in parents of ASD individuals and suggest its componential nature, supporting the fractionation of the triad of impairments. However, Losh et al’s research did not control for other disorders such as schizophrenia, which has been proven to have phenotypic similarities to ASD, that also impair social cognition (Sasson et al., 2007). Research seeking to replicate this study should pre-screen for such disorders that could affect ability in tasks, to confirm finding specificity to ASD. Low to moderate inter-corelations between the triad domains of impairment in ASD individuals has been outlined by researchers as evidence in favour of the fractionation theory (Happé et al., 2006). Conversely, Murray et al (2014) suggests this may be a product of range restriction, underestimating the inter-corelation between traits in those diagnosed. It is argued that studies use of clinical samples represents only the extremes of ASD symptoms because of simultaneous selection in diagnosis, therefore attenuating trait variance and its corelation with other variables. Testing this Murray et al (2014) used a simulation study of 10,000,000 cases showing impairments in all 3 domains, to replicate diagnosis and compared this with real population data from 236 non ASD participants and 148 participants diagnosed with high functioning ASD or Asperger’s. Results showed significantly low inter-corelations between triad domains in the simulation study compared to the population study corelation. It was argued that this demonstrates the attenuation of inter-correlations between traits when simultaneous selection occurs. Murray suggest that investigations of ASD symptom inter-corelations should use both clinical samples and non-diagnosed participants, if we are to assume the characteristic of ASD exist on a continuum within the general population. This conversely suggests that using the general population can serve to facilitate the argument that ASD is a coherent, non-fractionable disorder. With this being said, the use of a simulation to reflect the ASD diagnosis process lacks ecological validity and cannot fully capture the character of the selection process in diagnosis, meaning cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions. Furthermore, this study is not reflective of the broad spectrum of ASD as only high-functioning individuals were sampled meaning it cannot account for low-functioning individuals. To conclude the BAP has been influential in identifying the genetic basis of ASD with a wealth of family-based research supporting this claim (Losh et al., 2009; Constantino and Todd, 2005). However, it remains the case that no single gene can account for all aspects of triad, implying that they may be instead be symptom specific (Happé et al., 2006). Research with the general population and those displaying the BAP can also be used in support of ASD being a coherent disorder as suggested by Murray et al (2014).

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>In order to analyse to what extent English law’s approach to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith is satisfactory, it important to understand that the fundamental attitude towards good faith and the recent developments in good faith, that lead to a paradox within the law.  In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one’s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law.<nl>This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance.<nl><nl>Traditional Views Towards Good Faith<nl>Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law.  Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think – perhaps wrongly – is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\"  <nl>Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes  that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract.  However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court’s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. <nl><nl>Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith<nl>Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that ‘ Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..’ This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur.<nl><nl>Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law.<nl>Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre – contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre – negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. <nl><nl><nl>The Quota To Satisfy<nl>Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to ‘proceed in good faith’ as well as ‘use reasonable endeavours’ to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was ‘no objective criteria’, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably.  This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, ‘is there a certainty of object?’, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is ‘ are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?’ This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts.<nl><nl>Upholding the contract leading too much involvement<nl>Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to ‘make’ the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was ‘It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the ‘natural and ordinary meaning’ of the words used by the parties.’ The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment.<nl><nl>                                       Alternatives to solve uncertainty<nl>Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law. ",

In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre – negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. The Quota To Satisfy Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to ‘proceed in good faith’ as well as ‘use reasonable endeavours’ to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was ‘no objective criteria’, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably. This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, ‘is there a certainty of object?’, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is ‘ are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?’ This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts. Upholding the contract leading too much involvement Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to ‘make’ the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was ‘It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the ‘natural and ordinary meaning’ of the words used by the parties.’ The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment. Alternatives to solve uncertainty Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts. Conclusion To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law."

Subsequently, impedance was checked and found to be below 10Kohms, and the Biopac was then set up to record raw EEG data at 0.5- 35Hz. The experimenter then set up a calculation channel to record the alpha frequency in the brain at the range of 8-13Hz and the digital channels were also set to receive event markers from Psychopy and Stimtracker. Event markers were then added after the Interstimulus Interval (ISI) routine and was sent by the software to the Biopac at stimulus onset allowing for an analysis of brain activity at that point in time.

      "raw_text": "Aims and Research Questions<nl>The topic of research being discussed in this essay is one of the experiences during a pandemic. This was chosen as a topic of research as it is interesting to see what experiences people going through during a pandemic. It is a situation which we are all facing and gaining a deeper insight into a particular individuals experience can allow us to overcome the likely feelings of going through the pandemic alone. Thus, the main research question was: ‘How has living in a global pandemic affected one’s life?’. From this, a semi- structured interview schedule was created containing open-ended questions with impromptu follow up questions to encourage free accounts and detailed responses (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003).<nl>Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method:<nl>Using IPA allows us to gain what Conrad (1987) terms as an ‘insider’s perspective’. We are submerged into one’s personal experience where we try to make sense of how they view the world and use that information as a basis for interpretation. We are not taking a holistic view but rather identifying and acknowledging that every detail that has been spoken upon adds to the view that one has of the pandemic, hence the idiographic approach. This is contrasted with discourse analysis where the pandemic would be viewed as a ‘social construct’ and one would deconstruct what is being said and how language is used to construct our experience of the pandemic and whether that is a normalised concept in society (Wood, 2000). In using IPA, we look beyond COVID 19 as a pandemic, but delve deeper into how it has impacted an individual’s life. This is done through a double hermeneutic approach (Giddens,1987) hence a bottom-up analysis of data. The data was read through several times, each time noting language use, phrases and emergent feelings that stand out. Emerging themes were then transformed from the notes and commonalities between themes were combined into majorsub themes, allowing for analysis of data through a chain of connections.<nl>Analysis<nl><data_extract><nl>This major theme aims to capture the difficulties living during a global pandemic. In this unpredictable circumstance, it is evident that it is taking a toll on Mia as here we see her use negative language whilst explaining what she is going through.<nl><data_extract><nl>The sense of the pandemic being a difficult circumstance was made evident through the repetition of \"unfortunate\" which was mentioned three times during the interview. This repetition resonates with an individual thus spotlighting how bad her experience is. Mia is unable to shake the ill feelings off and due to this, it is likely that Mia cannot help but call the circumstance unfortunate as it seems like it is the only key word that can truly capture what the feeling is like. Social interactions due to government lockdowns has meant that Mia has been unable to socially interact with others as she would have done previously and as this is an unchanging circumstance, Mia has likely come to terms with it and accepted it through the \"unfortunate\" being paired with \"…it is what it is\". It suggests her experience serves some kind of ambiguity and later elaborates the effects of this ambiguity by saying the situation \"is out of my control\", rendering her useless in a sense.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Mia’s emphasis on the word \"much\" denotes a significant emotional toll on her, regardless of anything else that may be happening in her life. This is in contrast to how life was pre-pandemic as she describes it as being \"WAY WAY better\", the expressed emphasis on \"WAY\" announces how much happier Mia was before this happened, showing the drastic shift in life experiences for Mia. Similarly, we see Mia go through a phase of disconnection – \"for example (.) yeah)\". This incomplete sentence signifies Mia trying to disengage from the situation, perhaps as a coping mechanism. She later admits that life has acutely changed as she knows one, including herself, now has to be \"careful\" when living life, bringing to light the sombre undertones of it all.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>Here, Mia is actively aware that the difficulties she is currently facing is for the good of the wider society. She displays an act of selflessness, moving towards the viewpoint that what the government is trying to do to keep everyone safe is a good thing thus providing a contrast to the difficulties she faces. This provides a turning point to Mia’s attitude as it reveals that her subconscious knows that this is a serious, unpredictable matter that needs addressing.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>The issue on mental health has clearly impacted Mia and has thus shaped her perception of what we call ‘freedom’. She no longer takes it for advantage, but rather takes it into her stride and appreciates the efforts taken by government to ensure all people are well and safe.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>Here, we get a sense of her deeper emotions during the pandemic and thus this quotation calling for a double entendre. First, the likely obvious meaning of Mia feeling hidden or concealed from the world, mainly due to the lockdowns mentioned during the interview. This is coincided with her emphasis on the word \"definitely\" when asked about her lost connections during the period of lockdown. It is evident that her relationships outside of her family meant a lot to her as she describes the experience as being \"really tough\", adding to the feeling of being hidden thus indicating that the relations have influenced part of her experience and has somewhat shaped her current identity and how she is managing to cope as she is lost in something that is so big<nl>However, in saying this, we also see a shift in her feeling \"shrouded\" as due to the connection with her friends drifting away, other, stronger, connection was being built with her family. She states, \"felt more connected to my family\". As this connection has been made stronger, Mia’s sense of feeling \"shrouded\" disappears and we see her experience being shed in a much more positive light – \"it’s made me feel better about the whole situation\".

      "fixed_text": "Aims and Research Questions The topic of research being discussed in this essay is one of the experiences during a pandemic. This was chosen as a topic of research as it is interesting to see what experiences people going through during a pandemic. It is a situation which we are all facing and gaining a deeper insight into a particular individuals experience can allow us to overcome the likely feelings of going through the pandemic alone. Thus, the main research question was: ‘How has living in a global pandemic affected one’s life?’. From this, a semi- structured interview schedule was created containing open-ended questions with impromptu follow up questions to encourage free accounts and detailed responses (Smith and Osborn, 2003). Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method: Using IPA allows us to gain what Conrad (1987) terms as an ‘insider’s perspective’. We are submerged into one’s personal experience where we try to make sense of how they view the world and use that information as a basis for interpretation. We are not taking a holistic view but rather identifying and acknowledging that every detail that has been spoken upon adds to the view that one has of the pandemic, hence the idiographic approach. This is contrasted with discourse analysis where the pandemic would be viewed as a ‘social construct’ and one would deconstruct what is being said and how language is used to construct our experience of the pandemic and whether that is a normalised concept in society (Wood, 2000). In using IPA, we look beyond COVID 19 as a pandemic, but delve deeper into how it has impacted an individual’s life. This is done through a double hermeneutic approach (Giddens,1987) hence a bottom-up analysis of data. The data was read through several times, each time noting language use, phrases and emergent feelings that stand out. Emerging themes were then transformed from the notes and commonalities between themes were combined into majorsub themes, allowing for analysis of data through a chain of connections. Analysis This major theme aims to capture the difficulties living during a global pandemic. In this unpredictable circumstance, it is evident that it is taking a toll on Mia as here we see her use negative language whilst explaining what she is going through. The sense of the pandemic being a difficult circumstance was made evident through the repetition of \"unfortunate\" which was mentioned three times during the interview. This repetition resonates with an individual thus spotlighting how bad her experience is. Mia is unable to shake the ill feelings off and due to this, it is likely that Mia cannot help but call the circumstance unfortunate as it seems like it is the only key word that can truly capture what the feeling is like. Social interactions due to government lockdowns has meant that Mia has been unable to socially interact with others as she would have done previously and as this is an unchanging circumstance, Mia has likely come to terms with it and accepted it through the \"unfortunate\" being paired with \"…it is what it is\". It suggests her experience serves some kind of ambiguity and later elaborates the effects of this ambiguity by saying the situation \"is out of my control\", rendering her useless in a sense. Mia’s emphasis on the word \"much\" denotes a significant emotional toll on her, regardless of anything else that may be happening in her life. This is in contrast to how life was pre-pandemic as she describes it as being \"WAY WAY better\", the expressed emphasis on \"WAY\" announces how much happier Mia was before this happened, showing the drastic shift in life experiences for Mia. Similarly, we see Mia go through a phase of disconnection – \"for example (.) yeah)\". This incomplete sentence signifies Mia trying to disengage from the situation, perhaps as a coping mechanism. She later admits that life has acutely changed as she knows one, including herself, now has to be \"careful\" when living life, bringing to light the sombre undertones of it all. Here, Mia is actively aware that the difficulties she is currently facing is for the good of the wider society. She displays an act of selflessness, moving towards the viewpoint that what the government is trying to do to keep everyone safe is a good thing thus providing a contrast to the difficulties she faces. This provides a turning point to Mia’s attitude as it reveals that her subconscious knows that this is a serious, unpredictable matter that needs addressing. The issue on mental health has clearly impacted Mia and has thus shaped her perception of what we call ‘freedom’. She no longer takes it for advantage, but rather takes it into her stride and appreciates the efforts taken by government to ensure all people are well and safe. Here, we get a sense of her deeper emotions during the pandemic and thus this quotation calling for a double entendre. First, the likely obvious meaning of Mia feeling hidden or concealed from the world, mainly due to the lockdowns mentioned during the interview. This is coincided with her emphasis on the word \"definitely\" when asked about her lost connections during the period of lockdown. It is evident that her relationships outside of her family meant a lot to her as she describes the experience as being \"really tough\", adding to the feeling of being hidden thus indicating that the relations have influenced part of her experience and has somewhat shaped her current identity and how she is managing to cope as she is lost in something that is so big However, in saying this, we also see a shift in her feeling \"shrouded\" as due to the connection with her friends drifting away, other, stronger, connection was being built with her family. She states, \"felt more connected to my family\". As this connection has been made stronger, Mia’s sense of feeling \"shrouded\" disappears and we see her experience being shed in a much more positive light – \"it’s made me feel better about the whole situation\". She has used her family as a way of accommodating her feeling hidden and lonely, having left university and most of her friends. Lines 38-39 indicates that Mia is trying to escape her mental health issues, almost as if she is begging and crying out for help as she wants to be able to do the things that she could do beforehand without any restrictions. It is evident that affirmations have somewhat aided in Mia’s recurrent undesirable experience, especially through the repetition of \"I believe\". It is as if Mia is seeking reassurance within herself for her experiences, she is trying to keep up the feelings of optimism however, her subconscious knowledge of how bad the situation is, is hindering the positivity she is trying to portray. Thus, through this emphasis, we gain a possible insight into Mia’s way of gaining control in her life, considering the unpredictability of the pandemic. \"We will get back to normality as if nothing ever happened. Life will return back to how it was before\" Here, Mia is explaining and imagining what the foreseeable future is going to hold for her, allowing her to relieve the weight of the pandemic off her shoulders. She plans to endeavour on her future plans. Nonetheless, this comes from Mia straying away from the question, seemingly getting carried away by her imagination, \"(.) lol anyways, back to working as a carer\", snapping back to reality, showing that her current experience seems to shift her focus in everyday life, even when speaking on something that is not directly linked to the pandemic. Conclusion COVID 19 seems to be more than just a ‘pandemic’. It is the one thing that we have all experienced and have in common; whether that may be for the good or bad. For some, it has been an experience of self-actualisation, a time where you find your flaws and develop them for the better.

      "raw_text": "Abstract<nl>This experiment was conducted to investigate the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task. The hypothesis for this experiment were that participants alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from the left of the parietal lobe. Participants were cued to expect stimuli on the right or left. The results were as hypothesised: when recording alpha range activity from the left parietal lobe amplitudes were higher in the left cue than right cue condition. In conclusion alpha activity can be modulated by attention and visual stimuli is processed on the opposite side stimuli is presented. The data were valid in his experiment.<nl>Introduction<nl>AIH is where high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). However, alpha is reduced in task relevant brain areas this means that alpha activity can be modulated by attention. Visual stimuli is processed contralaterally, so stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left will be processed on the right. Handel at al (2001) explains that higher alpha power contralateral to the unattended side means that unattended stimuli is associated with an increase in alpha activity, that therefore means alpha frequencies are higher if stimuli are not paid attention to. Sauseng et al. (2015) study, participants saw a cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms, an arrow showing which hemifield a target would appear was presented at the centre. There was an interval of 600-800ms. White bars on black background were presented for 50ms. Sauseng et al. (2015) had similar results to Handel in that there was less alpha activity on the side of the brain stimuli were processed. This shows that there is more alpha activity in the parietal lobe on the side where stimuli is not processed.<nl>In this experiment a partial replication of Sauseng et al (2005) was conducted. This was recorded on the left parietal lobe (P3) as he found that parietal sites were good indicators of alpha in relation to attention. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experiment is that alpha amplitudes (in microvolts) would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. <nl><nl><nl><nl>METHOD<nl>Participants<nl>There were 39 participants initially, but one participants' data was removed as data was only available for one of the two conditions therefore 38 participants data was collected and analysed. Participants were from a volunteer sample of undergraduate Psychology students. <nl>Design<nl>The design of this study was a within subject’s design as each participant saw both cue left and right conditions. The independent variable was cue location with 2 levels left and right. The dependent variable was alpha amplitudes in microvolts.<nl>Materials<nl>The materials used for this experiment was a Biopac MP36 to collect EEG data and receive event markers, EEG electrodes, AC Cream to improve conductivity, Everi cream, PsychoPy software used for running the experiment and send event markers to Biopac through a stimtracker device. Finally, stimulus, small and large white bars to be displayed on a black background (as shown in figure 1a and 1b) were used as well as cues: left and right arrows as shown like this &lt; and &gt;.<nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>Participant’s gave consent prior to taking part in this experiment. A Biopac was set up to record alpha range activity (8-13Hz) and to receive left and right cue event markers. The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. The electrodes were then placed on the head using the 1020 electrode placement system. 3 electrodes, the active electrode is the site being measured and will be attached to region P3. The reference electrode is attached to Fz as it provides a comparison. Finally earth electrode reduces electrical activity and will be attached to the forehead near the hairline.<nl>The impedance was checked and was below 10 kOhms.There were 12 practice trials in total where the ISI were fixed, and participants were given feedback. The experimental trials were the same as the practice trials but there were 20 blocks of 4 trials (cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) and 80 trials in total with random time interval. Experimenters told participants that they would see cues with an arrow presented for 34ms and to expect a stimulus.There was an interval between 600 and 800ms. The stimuli either large or small bar were shown for 50ms. Experimenters told participants to respond on the keyboard with ‘s’ for small or ‘l’ for large. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset during the experimental but not practice trials. The event markers allowed us to identify exactly when stimulus appeared on the screen. 200ms before stimulus onset were isolated to examine the effect of the cues on brain activity. Participants were debriefed and had a right to withdraw data. The experimenter cleaned the participant and analysed the data. <nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment <nl>The period of 200ms before stimulus onset was looked at and analysed. To get the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to the average data event markers were sent from psychoPy to identify when stimuli were presented. The alpha amplitudes in the 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. Rectifying the raw data turns all the minus values into plus values giving an average deviation from 0 in microvolts regardless of whether the alpha activity was excitatory or inhibitory. Averaging over 50 samples minimising outliers and extreme values, smoothing the curves making it easier to interpret the data. The data is then known as Rectified and averaged Alpha Amplitudes (RAAA).<nl>Analysis<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that median alpha amplitudes in P3 were higher in the cue left than cue right condition 200ms before the stimulus was presented, A Shapiro-Wilk test showed the values for the cue left and cue right conditions: (W= 0.827, n =38, p &lt;.001) and (W=0.846, n=38, p &lt;.001) The data were not normally distributed (p &lt; .05) therefore a Wilcoxon signed ranks test was done to analyse the data. This showed that the difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p &lt; .005). <nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported in that alpha activity increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left hemifield as opposed to the right hemifield 200ms before stimulus was presented. These results were consistent with alpha inhibition hypothesis as high alpha amplitudes and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007) on the ipsilateral side where cue was presented. Stimuli that was presented on the right was processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left was processed on the right consistent with Handel at al (2001) research.<nl>A methodological problem that might have affected the results is doing an experiment in a distracting environment as noise can disrupt attention and concentration when this experiment is a visual attention task. This experiment was conducted in a room full of people also conducting their experiment which accumulated to loud noise. Spencer et al (2000) also concludes that noisy environments are known to influence cognitive processing. Noise can be very distracting leading to interference making the results vary in validity. Another methodological problem that could occur is varying levels of impedance. Strict adherence to impedance of &lt; 10kOhms is required here, a higher or lower impedance can make the experiment invalid.<nl> In conclusion the differences were in the anticipated direction empirically and theoretically consistent with other researchers' results suggesting that, despite some of the issues, the data were valid as it supports the AIH theory of stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and vice versa. Overall, this means that this study was reliable making it replicable as it follows the same results as Sauseng et al’s (2005) study.",

In conclusion alpha activity can be modulated by attention and visual stimuli is processed on the opposite side stimuli is presented. The data were valid in his experiment. Introduction AIH is where high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). However, alpha is reduced in task relevant brain areas this means that alpha activity can be modulated by attention. Visual stimuli is processed contralaterally, so stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left will be processed on the right. Handel at al (2001) explains that higher alpha power contralateral to the unattended side means that unattended stimuli is associated with an increase in alpha activity, that therefore means alpha frequencies are higher if stimuli are not paid attention to. Sauseng et al. (2015) study, participants saw a cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms, an arrow showing which hemifield a target would appear was presented at the centre. There was an interval of 600-800ms. White bars on black background were presented for 50ms. Sauseng et al. (2015) had similar results to Handel in that there was less alpha activity on the side of the brain stimuli were processed. This shows that there is more alpha activity in the parietal lobe on the side where stimuli is not processed. In this experiment a partial replication of Sauseng et al (2005) was conducted. This was recorded on the left parietal lobe (P3) as he found that parietal sites were good indicators of alpha in relation to attention. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experiment is that alpha amplitudes (in microvolts) would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. METHOD Participants There were 39 participants initially, but one participants' data was removed as data was only available for one of the two conditions therefore 38 participants data was collected and analysed. Participants were from a volunteer sample of undergraduate Psychology students. Design The design of this study was a within subject’s design as each participant saw both cue left and right conditions. The independent variable was cue location with 2 levels left and right. The dependent variable was alpha amplitudes in microvolts. Materials The materials used for this experiment was a Biopac MP36 to collect EEG data and receive event markers, EEG electrodes, AC Cream to improve conductivity, Everi cream, PsychoPy software used for running the experiment and send event markers to Biopac through a stimtracker device. Finally, stimulus, small and large white bars to be displayed on a black background (as shown in figure 1a and 1b) were used as well as cues: left and right arrows as shown like this and . Procedure Participant’s gave consent prior to taking part in this experiment. A Biopac was set up to record alpha range activity (8-13Hz) and to receive left and right cue event markers. The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. The electrodes were then placed on the head using the 1020 electrode placement system. 3 electrodes, the active electrode is the site being measured and will be attached to region P3. The reference electrode is attached to Fz as it provides a comparison. Finally earth electrode reduces electrical activity and will be attached to the forehead near the hairline. The impedance was checked and was below 10 kOhms.There were 12 practice trials in total where the ISI were fixed, and participants were given feedback. The experimental trials were the same as the practice trials but there were 20 blocks of 4 trials (cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) and 80 trials in total with random time interval. Experimenters told participants that they would see cues with an arrow presented for 34ms and to expect a stimulus.There was an interval between 600 and 800ms. The stimuli either large or small bar were shown for 50ms. Experimenters told participants to respond on the keyboard with ‘s’ for small or ‘l’ for large. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset during the experimental but not practice trials. The event markers allowed us to identify exactly when stimulus appeared on the screen. 200ms before stimulus onset were isolated to examine the effect of the cues on brain activity. Participants were debriefed and had a right to withdraw data. The experimenter cleaned the participant and analysed the data. Results Data Treatment The period of 200ms before stimulus onset was looked at and analysed. To get the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to the average data event markers were sent from psychoPy to identify when stimuli were presented. The alpha amplitudes in the 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. Rectifying the raw data turns all the minus values into plus values giving an average deviation from 0 in microvolts regardless of whether the alpha activity was excitatory or inhibitory. Averaging over 50 samples minimising outliers and extreme values, smoothing the curves making it easier to interpret the data. The data is then known as Rectified and averaged Alpha Amplitudes (RAAA). Analysis Table 1. Shows that median alpha amplitudes in P3 were higher in the cue left than cue right condition 200ms before the stimulus was presented, A Shapiro-Wilk test showed the values for the cue left and cue right conditions: (W= 0.827, n =38, p <.001) and (W=0.846, n=38, p <.001) The data were not normally distributed (p < .05) therefore a Wilcoxon signed ranks test was done to analyse the data. This showed that the difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p < .005). Discussion The research hypothesis was supported in that alpha activity increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left hemifield as opposed to the right hemifield 200ms before stimulus was presented. These results were consistent with alpha inhibition hypothesis as high alpha amplitudes and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007) on the ipsilateral side where cue was presented. Stimuli that was presented on the right was processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left was processed on the right consistent with Handel at al (2001) research.<nl>A methodological problem that might have affected the results is doing an experiment in a distracting environment as noise can disrupt attention and concentration when this experiment is a visual attention task. This experiment was conducted in a room full of people also conducting their experiment which accumulated to loud noise. Spencer et al (2000) also concludes that noisy environments are known to influence cognitive processing. Noise can be very distracting leading to interference making the results vary in validity. Another methodological problem that could occur is varying levels of impedance. Strict adherence to impedance of kOhms is required here, a higher or lower impedance can make the experiment invalid.nl In conclusion the differences were in the anticipated direction empirically and theoretically consistent with other researchers' results suggesting that, despite some of the issues, the data were valid as it supports the AIH theory of stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and vice versa. Overall, this means that this study was reliable making it replicable as it follows the same results as Sauseng et al’s (2005) study."

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl>Middle managers have four main roles within an organization that they are tasked with in order to bring the firm success. Good middle managers should be sense makers of strategy and so explain and simplify what the strategic goals of the firm are, adaptors of strategy and so react to changes in the industry environment. They should also be local leaders meaning that they lead and direct those on lower levels to them while also being champions of strategic issues, going around the firm resolving and communicating the relevant issues to top management. A critical role of middle managers in strategy is sense making, as detailed in a report by Burgelman (1983) they shape the strategy of internal development and give form to the directives given from above, the Top Managers. Middle managers are the ones most directly involved with the people, products &amp; diversified groups and are therefore the impetus with which the strategy of an organisation can be implemented and developed, giving them great importance and relevance.<nl><nl>Middle managers are also implementors of strategy, one that has been developed and created by top managers, they allow for the testing of the possible flaws and failings of what has been handed down to them. Subsequently it is the middle managers again that have the responsibility and need to synthesize the information they receive while disseminating it to the top as well as operating level managers in order to facilitate the flow of information in the firm (Kuratko, 2005). This highlights the importance of middle level managers in the firm as they are in the perfect position to keep information going both ways and are able to connect top management to the lower levels of the firm which are normally very disconnected. As a result, at often times middle managers will need to ‘sell’ key issues to top management, persuading them to commit to resolving certain strategic issues they deem necessary to address. If middle level managers cannot attract the attention of senior management to fix and improve strategy this could lead to the ultimate demise of the company as a whole.<nl><nl>The eventual downfall of the mobile giant Nokia can in part be attributed to the failings of the middle managers, and the obstacles put in their way that prohibited them from completing their role as communicators and implementors of strategy. The middle managers were technological experts, the managers and their teams had a deep understanding of Symbian, the software Nokia used, it’s faults and flaws. This best placed them to give advice on what was and what wasn’t working, however the Nokia case study provides a perfect example of when communication isn’t open and positive and the aftereffects. Due to the atmosphere of fear and lack of openness, most middle managers were hesitant to mention their true feelings and communicate the problems to the top (Vuori &amp; Huy, 2016). This meant that the middle managers weren’t able to fulfil their roles, and Nokia’s fall illustrated that without them the business could not function cohesively as a unit.<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>One of the evident issues within Nokia was that there was a great lack of trust from the Top management to the lower levels, and this trust needed to be tangible for middle managers to keep an open dialogue with senior management. In order for information to flow from the lower levels to the upper levels of an organisation trust and a sense of ontological security is necessary, middle managers need to feel like they can openly disclose failures and mistakes with top management, however this wasn’t the case in Nokia. In addition, this trust was to be harboured by top management and it was their responsibility to reduce the fear that failure would lead to punishment (Mantere, S. 2008), instead instigating and encouraging a culture of openness with a sense of security. This culture of fear of failure was not something that could be amended by middle managers but needed action from top management. Since the early 1990’s this high-pressured culture was reinforced with social and economic sanctions, which, as time moved on, further demotivated middle managers to present the real problems that were occurring within the organisation, leading to skewed information flows between the lower and higher levels.<nl><nl>The literature indicates that the motivation to sell issues to top management is based on the organisational context of the firm, the theory of Issue-selling intention as explained by Yan Ling et al. (2005) clearly highlights the underlying issues within Nokia’s management. The theory details three contextual cues that motivate middle managers to sell issues to top management: Perceived organisational support, top management’s open mindedness and relationship quality. Albeit none of these were present in Nokia. The first factor, perceived organisational support, is when employees feel safe selling issues to senior management either formally or informally. However, some at the top in Nokia were described as ‘extremely temperamental’ and seen at often times as intimidating, threatening to fire those that made mistakes, creating a hostile environment in the firm disincentivizing middle managers to sell issues. This exacerbated the other contextual cue of relationship quality, given the perceived aggression from top management the relationship between the different levels could not be trusting nor friendly and resultantly gave middle managers no reason to say things that the top would not want to hear. This would not lead to imminent problems, as seen by Nokia’s continued growth during this period, although it did lead to a sense of conformity overtime disallowing middle managers to have a positive impact on Nokia’s strategic decision making.<nl><nl>The theory of Issue-selling intention clearly defines that it should be top management facilitating an ease of communication and instigating a sense of security with bringing forward problems present in the firm. The key underlying issue was the oppressive and domineering culture present at Nokia which created a chasm between top and middle level management. Given that this culture had been present for more than a decade top management should have taken action, slowly opening more channels of communication between the middle and top levels while assuring support for those that did come forward.<nl><nl><question3><nl><nl>To anyone working for Nokia it was clear that what top management said could not be refuted, being critical was not a part of the corporate culture and there were fierce repercussions threatened for those that spoke out of line. Within this context, middle managers needed to thread the needle and influence strategic direction in a way that wouldn’t cause friction with top management. One of these ways could have been issue bundling, where the middle managers would try to tie their issues with already agreed-upon goals so as to highlight the importance of their issue to top management in a way that could not be overlooked (Dutton et al., 2001). Middle management could for example try tying their issues to valued goals such as profitability and in this way increase the likelihood of having their issue addressed. This would have been a potent way for middle managers to get senior management to take action on issues that were very evident but not brought up for fear of being reprimanded.<nl><nl>In addition to this bundling of issues, another way in which middle level management could influence strategy and implement change would be through the collaboration and wider involvement of employees in selling the issues. Communication did not flow upwards within Nokia, but it did flow horizontally within those at the same level and middle level managers discussed openly the choices they made and reports they gave top management. As a result of collaboration with likeminded individuals, the middle managers would be able to win internal allies and accumulate internal influence (Wickert, C. et al., 2018). In turn managers would feel more empowered and confident to critique the top management’s instructions, which overtime would change the corporate culture and create a more open dialogue within the business. Therefore, middle level managers could have brought their issues to the top easier if they turned to each other for support as they knew of the problems plaguing the business but were too intimidated to bring them forward.<nl><nl>On the contrary, whatever change to come about would take time to implement, as shown on the theory of ‘The transition curve’. The first two phases of this theory capture the difficulty of individuals letting go of the past and coming to terms with the need for change (Balogun et al., 2016). As depicted on the theory, it would take a lot of courage to go against the corporate culture and begin to criticise top management knowing the risks that this would entail and would then lead to lower self-confidence of the managers. A caveat however would be that this theory solely focuses on the individual, and forgets the effect of the collective, which in this case would be great given the change undertaken to influence strategy would be done by all the middle managers, cohesively.<nl><nl><question4><nl><nl>The Nokia case study illustrates the rise and fall of a global market leader and highlights the difficulties of maintaining success in the face of an ever-changing external environment. Firms need to be able to move with the times so as to not be left behind. If there are parts of the firm, especially core competencies, that aren’t working as well as they once did then the firm needs to put it behind them and move on. Incumbents are often ‘overthrown’ when they cannot recognise the threat posed by disruptive innovation and instead continue with the converse of sustaining innovation (Schmidt, G.M., 2008). This was most certainly the case with Nokia, it had invested so much in its own software Symbian that there could be no doubts about its longevity and top management continually asked to incrementally update and change it. This was a key mistake, however, as not only was the software old fashioned as compared to the newer and improved IOS systems, but it was also very difficult to work with. The fact that Nokia tried to force Symbian to work for so long is in part what led it to its eventual demise. Instead, the firm should have cut out Symbian as soon as it stopped producing results and moved on with radical OS innovation that the firm so sorely needed in order to face the increasing competition. This in turn would have reduced pressure on the software organisation and given them the time necessary to produce a quality product instead of rushing results just to meet deadlines.<nl><nl>Overtime this lack of transformational change will cause a business to become less and less in touch with the ever-changing demands of consumers. The phenomenon of Strategic Drift will resultantly occur when a firm becomes less in line with the environment within which the organization operates (Johnson, G., 1992), this was the case with Nokia and can lead to a firms eventual demise. Incumbent firms use incremental change, continuing with the practices that have made them so successful in the past, until the reach a flux. At this point managers are unsure of what to do as they have fallen so far behind market trends and resultantly if they do not start transformational change then they may die. This theory can be useful for incumbent firms to recognise the faults that they can make but should be wary that the theory is not as simple as it seems. As in the Nokia case, it took a few years before the firm really started seeing the negative results from not adapting to the times and as a result the theory may be seen as too simplistic in truly addressing the heart of the issue.<nl><nl>A final key point that incumbent firms could learn from Nokia is that they cannot become arrogant and must keep managers humble so as to mitigate the overestimation of one’s capabilities. There was a lack of concern from the top, consistent within the middle levels of management that the iPhone was no threat to them. This sentiment arose from the feelings that the firm was invincible due to its market leadership and R&amp;D strength where it had invested over $50 billion over two decades. The overzealousness of the managers would lead to an incorrect assessment of the threat of competition, and lead to an eventual decline of the firm. Incumbent firms should take this example and remain sober minded with regards to competition and learn from Nokia the effects that disruptive innovation can have.",

      "raw_text": "Expression of emotion is one of the key ways in which humans communicate with one another and this expression is executed in many ways through tone of voice, body language (Medjden et al., 2020), the language we speak (Sun et al., 2020) and most importantly, our facial expressions. To effectively communicate with facial expressions, humans need to be able to correctly recognise these emotions and respond appropriately. Here, the question of what constitutes correct recognition of facial displays of emotion arises. This is achieved when the perceiver recognises the emotion intended by the person expressing the emotion. Thus, according to this definition, correct recognition of emotion is very subjective, proving that recognition of facial displays of emotion is a non-universal process. There are many factors that determine the non-universality of this phenomenon, but for this essay, only three factors will be discussed: 1) culture (Widen et al., 2011), 2) gender (Spies and Sevincer, 2018), and 3) mental illness (Uljaravic and Hamilton, 2013). This essay reviews the literature surrounding these factors and aims to support the argument of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion being non-universal with a wide range of convergent evidence.<nl><nl>The main factor to consider when arguing that recognition of facial displays is not universal is the role of culture. There has been vast amount of research that proves that culture does indeed influence emotion recognition. For example, studies by Widen et al (2011) found that culture influences the recognition of the basic emotions (Ekman and Friesen 1976). They conducted two studies: the first one involved 88 university students from Boston college rating 10 different facial expressions – first with a free label format and then with a forced-choice format. The second study employed the exact same method, but they increased the list of choices in the forced-choice task to include the three most commonly mentioned states (confused, thinking, suspicious) and a \"none of the above\" option. They found that although there was moderate agreement on the predicted emotion when assessed with forced choice (study 1: 58%; study 2: 42%), there was significantly low agreement when participants were assessed with free labelling (study 1: 18%; study 2: 16%). Therefore, this contrast in agreement in the different conditions possibly suggest that the options presented in a forced choice task may influence and shape their answer, meaning it is not the ideal task type to use when conducting emotion recognition research. Moreover, free labelling tasks have more ecological validity, making them more valid than forced choice tasks. <nl><nl>However, as with any psychological research, this study has limitations. While the researchers made sure to include individuals from various backgrounds in their sample size, the main drawback is that all of the participants had some exposure to Western, US culture as they were all university students at an American university. This means that even participants who maybe were not US citizens, still had been exposed to Western culture to an extent which may have influenced their answers and thus, the data of the culturally diverse participants would not be as accurate as if they had never moved to the US. Therefore, it is important to consider research that has employed participants from non-Western backgrounds. <nl><nl>Neuroimaging research conducted by Harada et al (2020) shows emotion recognition is influenced by culture by showing that neural activity in certain brain areas was different among participants from different ethnic backgrounds and that in-group biases influenced this activity. The study involved 3 groups of participants; native Japanese (JP) individuals who lived in Japan, Caucasian Americans (CA) and Japanese Americans (JA) both of which lived in the US. The study involved an fMRI scan of the participants while they completed an emotional face and perceptual matching task, viewing stimuli of either Japanese or Caucasian faces depicting negative emotions (fear or anger) or simple shapes that served as control. The results of this study show that in-group biases and collectivistic values influence cultural modulation of neural response in the bilateral amygdala. Furthermore, bi-cultural JAs showed enhanced neural responses in the ventral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices during the perception of Japanese negative facial expression which suggests greater sensitivity to ingroup biases in individuals from more than one culture. Thus, this study is a prime example of how culture can shape emotion recognition – if this was a universal phenomenon, then all participants would have had the same level of neural activity in the amygdala however that was not the case. Furthermore, the researchers also made sure to select participants from collectivist cultures – those who had never been exposed to individualistic cultures – which make the data more reliable as it is less likely to be influenced by Western norms. As culture plays a significant role in influencing emotion recognition of facial displays of emotion, credibility to the belief that emotion recognition is non-universal is given.<nl><nl>Another factor to consider when discussing whether correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is a universal process is the role of gender. Research has shown that gender influences emotion perception and recognition among humans. Indeed, a study conducted by Spies and Sevincer (2018) showed that women were much better than men at recognising whether smiles were genuine or not. They used a behavioural experimental paradigm whereby they had participants judge single and adjacent photos. The single photos involved both authentic and unauthentic smiles and participants were required to indicate which smile they thought the photo showed. The adjacent photos involved photos of the same person depicting either an authentic smile or an unauthentic smile. The results showed that women outperformed men in differentiating the two types of smiles in the adjacent photos condition. This therefore suggests that gender does play a role in recognition of facial displays of emotion. <nl><nl>However, it is important to note that this study only explores gender influence in this area in only one type of experimental paradigm – a forced choice test. An issue with this type of test is that it lacks ecological validity as in real life, people differentiate facial displays of emotion through various means for example, via their eyes. Indeed, a study by Hall et al (2009), using eye tracking techniques, found that women were quicker and more accurate in recognising expressions than men and they looked more at the eyes of the person in the photo stimuli than men. Thus, this study shows that by even using a different experimental technique (other than a forced choice task) gender differences in recognition of facial displays of emotion are still evident. <nl><nl>Mental illnesses also have proven to be an influencing factor in the correct recognition of facial displays of emotion. In a meta-analysis study by Uljarevic and Hamilton (2013), it was found that autistic individuals found it difficult to recognise facial displays of emotion. The systematic review involved 48 papers that all employed a behavioural study paradigm, that is, participants in the study were required to do a type of behavioural task. The results of this meta-analysis found a large negative effect size that suggests the autistic individuals have a general impairment in emotion recognition. <nl><nl>However, it is too presumptive to claim that the findings of this meta-analysis are applicable to other research investigating the role of mental illnesses on recognition of emotions using different experimental paradigms, i.e. those that deal with neuro-psychological data that is obtained through neuro-imaging techniques or other physiological methods. As highlighted before, the above study looked at studies that employed behavioural tasks. It is important to establish whether the findings of that study would still be prevalent when alternative techniques are used. <nl><nl>In support of this, a meta-analysis study conducted by Cuve et al (2018) found similar results to the previous study, but their analysis included physiological and eye-tracking studies. This study involved a review of 21 studies and the results showed that the majority of the studies suggested that individuals with autism show a level of active or reflexive avoidance to the eyes, consequently missing the subtle social cues conveyed through this particular body part. The eyes are a crucial part of the body in that they play a significant role in processing emotional expressions, especially negatives ones such as fear and sadness (Scheller et al 2012). <nl><nl>Therefore, in line with the previous meta-analytic study discussed in this essay, the findings of this study also suggest that individuals with autism struggle recognising facial displays of emotion, especially negative emotion. Thus, with research that strongly supports the notion that mental illnesses play a role in influencing recognition of facial displays of behaviour, the notion that this phenomenon is not universal but rather dependent on many factors is proven to be more credible.<nl><nl>Overall, the non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is widely researched. The factors discussed in this essay all influence emotion recognition of facial displays in distinct ways; it seems individuals from different cultures perceive facial emotions differently, women, more than men, are more likely to correctly recognise facial displays of emotion and autistic individuals generally have a difficulty in distinguishing and thus recognising different emotions. It also important to note that while emotion recognition of faces can involve either positive or negative emotions, it is more often the case that these factors play a bigger role when individuals are required to distinguish between negative faces rather than positive ones. That is, non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is more evident in negative emotions than positive ones.",

Hi Gearard, thank you for the chat today, it cleared up a lot of things for me! Here are the papers I needed you to look over: The Horselenberg paper conducts a Pearson correlation with two other values, kappa and x-squared (Table 2 in the Results section) I'm not sure as to which value to include as the effect size. The Porter and Sanford studies are the ones that include an ANOVA and I wasn't sure on whether I should includeexclude them (Porter - table 1, Sanford - section 3.2, 3.3). In the Rasmussen paper, in both studies, they look at different aspects of topic, so just wanted to confirm that to get effect size for overall topic and topic, do I pool the different effect sizes together? Lastly, I forgot to ask this during our call, but once I've completed them, would you be able to look at the different sections of my dissertation and provide some feedback? I really appreciate the help once again. Kind Regards, . Hi Nolan, Just wanted to write a quick email to personally thank you for releasing a longer, more simplified version of the Week 3 lecture. It was much easier to understand and made me less worried about the module as a whole. I appreciate the time it takes to make longer asynchronous content so I'm grateful that you took our feedback on board and made the lectures more easy to understand. If you don't mind, I'd like to make a suggestion regarding the first two lectures of the module. I think I, along with other students studying the module, would really appreciate if you released another video of the first two lectures, just further explaining and simplifying the content as with the existing 30 min asynchronous videos, it's quite difficult to grasp a full understanding of the concepts discussed in those lectures. I understand that making these asynchronous chunks can be quite time consuming and that you may have still yet to recordrelease the weeks 4 and 5 content, so I think it would be reasonable if you released them after the module content has been fully covered. I also realise that we have quite some time left till our summer exams so there is no rush to release the videos any sooner. I hope my feedback makes sense and once again, thank you for taking it on board. It's much appreciated! Kind Regards, . Final Year course Student university"

      "raw_text": "How can media be simultaneously supporting and endangering our democracy? <nl>In recent years, there has been a profound dispute regarding the institution of media and the part it plays for crippling ethical principles within a democracy. My argument in this essay is that both these processes have a pivotal role to play in facilitating and hindering societal growth. Regardless of these, we should work to fortify this institution as both factors are necessary for the growth of our democracy and this institution has a fundamental role to play in protecting the interests of all citizens as well as promoting equality. <nl>The power of media has been constantly viewed in terms of the ability of a single individual or group to enforce order and command authority over a vast number, enabling the entity to hold power over something like a media environment with ease (Freedman a 2014, pp.11). This resulted in weakening the public domain via undermining the autonomy and wide range of diversity that is necessary for democracy to take place effectively. As an example, take Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who has an immense amount of power, control and influence, some might even say that it is unprecedented. The most troublesome element of Facebook is Zuckerberg’s ability to manipulate and influence the data of two billion people (Hughes, 2019, pp.7). <nl>Over the years, Zuckerberg has accumulated a few companies such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The sheer amount of unparalleled control and influence that a single individual has is staggering. In addition, this immense level of power that Zuckerberg has at his disposal is unwanted and undemocratic. The reasoning being that such an extensive amount of power, no matter how good the intentions, does instigate corruption. There is the constant risk of using this kind of concentrated power, especially when left unchecked, for personal use and this, in turn, is dangerous (Freedman b 2014, pp.319-334). To put it into perspective Facebook uses the medium of media to get people to use its products. Then, they use the response of that individual to manufacture more data, making Facebook’s ability to calculate what you will do in a situation pervasive and a threat to democracy. (Zuboff 2018, pp. 287-289). <nl>Furthermore, another detrimental effect of democracy is that it risks the wrong choice of public servant. In this regard, the election of Donald Trump is an apt example. As Facebook has one of the most advanced predictive systems in the world, Trump was able to use this to his advantage by using the analytic data collected by Facebook. There were able to connect the files of voters to individual behaviour and then show specific ads that correlated with their voting patterns. Since winning the election Trump’s bizarre behaviour combined with his delusional ideas continually reinforces the fact that he is not fit to rule America and the main aid here was Facebook, which propelled the success of his election undermining the government (Bump 2018, p.1-2). <nl>Another factor is not adequately allowing individuals the right to vote. The devastating impact, which media has on our democracy is still present. Individuals can vote for individuals based on certain factors, such as how their ideology matches with the running candidate or something as <nl>fickle as admiring the appearance of the candidate. This can lead to bias where an individual is more likely to pick a candidate if their beliefs are aligned with theirs (Caselli, F 2007, pp1-3) These factors may not even have anything to do with how capable and well suited they are for the job. In the case of America, this worsened the fact that many states where Trump’s opposition received their votes were \"slave states\". There was an agreement made in the US constitution where every enslaved individual would only count as 35ths of a person (Acharya, A et al 2015, pp.4-7). This meant that even if more votes were obtained by other political candidates they would count as lesser votes overall, reducing their viability. <nl>In addition to this, there are profound issues when it comes to the topic of elite ownership and media power. Many individuals in the ruling class vigorously compete for power and ownership, which include the self-regulating ability to overcome democratic blocks (Marx 2010[1867] pp.8- 11). These individuals, known as the elite of society, often have a significant role to play in the media and the various ways that individuals, by certain messages, are susceptible to whatever the outlet portrays. They can use the controlling stakes they have in companies to get across a message that they want or control elements of news programs, newspapers and magazines all to the detriment of the working class and the surrounding institutions of society. Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Rupert Murdoch to name a few individuals who have bought controlling shares in media outlets. Rupert Murdoch, it can be said that he simply has too much power over the British state. (Helm, T et al 2011, pp1). Between them, they own media companies such as the Washington post and the Wall Street Journal, only further emphasising how the elite can hinder democracy. <nl>A sizeable number of shares bought by an individual would leave a company’s rule to one individual, especially with social media companies (Mills, C.W 1959:3-27). In this case, the media is hindering democracy since it is allowing certain individuals to misuse and manipulate public resources. This is because considering the amount of power that individuals can obtain over public and private sectors, to the point where they can influence and predict whom you vote for via subliminal messaging or manipulating your data to benefit their agendas. They can even go the extent of using your data to predict with a high degree of accuracy the way you will behave and the resultant impact on democracy. For example, the analytic data that Facebook collected and how it assisted Trump’s election. The possibilities are innumerous as to how they can exert their power. As a result, unethical practices are perpetuated, and the consequence is even more power and control which leads to a vicious cycle whereby the elite act in favour of the action which will provide them with the most benefit. These processes cripple democracy and making it feel more like a bureaucracy. <nl>Alternatively, even though the media can hinder democracy, there are ways that the media can support it, even strengthening it. One of these ways is that it protects the interest of its members. Democracy is unique in the sense that it allows people to get personally involved within their government. One way to achieve this is through social media platforms. In this way, <nl>the public have a sense of autonomy and a voice to speak up for themselves as to how they would prefer the running of their country. The choice is solely theirs as to whom they would want to elect depending on a wide range of reasons. One reason could be they think about who could, in the best way, represent their interests as well as benefit the country. Thus, giving the people free rein to choose whatever they like which also means that they could choose to not vote at all if they so wish. Everyone’s opinions, through their votes, are included. This is regardless of them being in the majority or not, which appeases the public and makes them more amiable to the idea of democracy (Caplan 2007, pp.3-7) <nl>Moreover, promoting equality positively is significantly beneficial to democracy. Through using a democratic system, which connects relationally with media, a person is free to explore differentiating arguments of the running candidates, a party’s manifesto details and any other details they could ever want to know. The fairness of this process is further emphasised by the fact that, regardless of social or economic background, public opinion is given. Even if you are wealthy or poor, have a lavish or humble lifestyle, under democracy your rights to vote are equal. Media only enhances the available opportunities. As a result, giving the liberal opportunity to engage in a political process in which you feel inclined towards since in the pure sense of democracy there is no bias or favouritisms. <nl>The media, being the main means of mass communication, is an enabler for democracy as having more educated voters can lead to a more legitimate government. Due to this media encourages mass participation and extends the reach that democracy can have over a country. This is beneficial as the institutions surrounding society also get strengthened as a result of the positive and consistent messages being promoted (Parsons 1992[1951] pp.45-51).Additionally, as larger numbers involved within a democracy means that a fairer and more representative process can take place and having an unrestricted, educated and varied choice enhances this. Thus, as individuals can make an informed decision how they want to engage in democratic practices, there is a higher degree of transparency within the government and that encourages more trust and in turn, makes democracy as fair and just of a system as possible (Katona, 2015 pp.359-394) <nl>For example, during elections there are several messages given about institutions, using the medium of media, such as education and health care. These include ideas such as improving the levels of education by developing a better curriculum and allocating more resources to ensure that students have a better overall quality of learning. Also, regarding the health care system the promise of more nurses, to improve the quality of service. Via this method, individuals engage within their political environment more if they know they are going to benefit as a result. So, as the surrounding institutions that underpin society strengthen, society becomes more stable. These institutions work synergistically building momentum of one another to <nl>reach a common social goal, stability (Canon, W.B 1987, pp.170-176). Thus, making it unavoidable for democracy to improve as well. <nl>Within a country, the group with the power to govern a country and its business is the government. This entity uses the tool of media to aid them in bettering the quality of democracy for everyone and strive to withhold the principles that their position stands for, which include the responsibilities they have to their nation. To hinder the monopoly of authorities, democracy needs to flourish. The state assists with this as the elected leaders are only in power for a certain period, so it is in their best interest to enforce the successful delivery of their promised policies, which benefit the people as well as their tenure but only if they are willing to do so. They are varied ways and methods in which they monopolise authority, a few of these being price capping and quality regulation (Bourdieu 1991[1982 pp.242-245]).Without the latter businesses would continuously put prices higher at a competitive rate leading to a decline in consumer welfare as well as lead to inefficiency. With the former, they can check the provision of good quality service as leaving businesses to their own devices will result in reluctance to keep the standards high. All this resulting in more stable democratic institutions. <nl>Nonetheless, government institutions, like any other institutions, are susceptible to exploitation as the elected use their position to support their own agenda, often using illegitimate means to get ahead. Furthermore, a beneficial point for media supporting democracy is that the structure of democracy works to reduce exploitation by spreading out the power that the role gives through bodies or committees who oversee the individual making sure no one has overarching power over the system. It is the fact that this task allows for easy power distribution, giving an equal opportunity for all (Gündemir, S. et al. 2017, pp.34-41). <nl>Within the government, the component of freedom usually allows individuals to act however, they want so long it is not at the detriment of others. Inside the structure of democracy, the population is free to act in any way they desire to seek any result. However, legal barriers restrict them, as they cannot go out of their way to harm another without repercussions. This governing structure grants the opportunity to pursue different careers and opportunities as well as giving a genuine voice to the people. Media is the thing that encourages such diversity, as you are free to express your own opinion and determine many lifestyle choices. <nl>Neither the communication tool, known as the media, is all-knowing nor is it useless. This tool can be capable of a vast amount such as altering the state and nature of dynamic relations within society for the better alongside mistaking acts and events creating a strain within society (Corner, 2011, pp.27-30). (For example) Due to the reasons mentioned, media can be a force for progressive change as well as a hindrance. It is safe to say that the media has a pivotal part to play within society, serving a variety of functions, and has multiple uses. Previously, having seen that the media can help the development of democracy, via methods such as promoting equality and the interest as citizens, individual trust within this process increases. Moreover, knowing that the media has the capacity to obstruct democracy. I am going to propose the argument that the media can neither endanger nor support democracy because it does not <nl>hold any power in and of itself. This communication outlet is merely the space in which power resides (Castells, 2009, pp.193). <nl>Therefore, media is not the chief proponent but merely hosts the interplay of power, control and dominance. It opens a vast space where people can come and hold power in areas such as business and politics (Freedman a, 2014, pp.11). Communication networks are central to this process and are key sources in society for it to hold power. The media agents involved help to spread this diverse message and engage in this with the end goal of altering the nature of the state (Castells, 2009, pp. 302-3). <nl>The problem has never been determining media’s influence with assisting or deteriorating the economic situation, it is more to do with who occupies and aggregates the larger sources of information and the amount of space they take within this network. Media’s main strength comes from the intertwining of various communication networks such as business, finance etc. Media weakens by the absence of news existing in some form or another within this domain. If there is nothing to occupy the space, then the impact of media is lackluster (Castells,2009, pp.194-195). Media cannot hold power over individuals of its own accord, it requires the strategic implementation of information from a combination of areas compiled into one place which then goes on to infiltrate all elements of social life. <nl>Conclusively, the relationship between media and democracy is extensive and far-reaching. Power, being ubiquitous in nature, seeps into the depths of media outlets and political institutions such as democracy. The power of media transcends merely control and is something far more perplexing. Even though we can see ways that media can assist and hinder democracy, its actual role is far greater and bewildering. I propose that more research is needed into the true nature of media and the way that its role functionally relates to different institutions, as well as the devastating impact it can have on society. <nl>",

Then, they use the response of that individual to manufacture more data, making Facebook’s ability to calculate what you will do in a situation pervasive and a threat to democracy. (Zuboff 2018, pp. 287-289). Furthermore, another detrimental effect of democracy is that it risks the wrong choice of public servant. In this regard, the election of Donald Trump is an apt example. As Facebook has one of the most advanced predictive systems in the world, Trump was able to use this to his advantage by using the analytic data collected by Facebook. There were able to connect the files of voters to individual behaviour and then show specific ads that correlated with their voting patterns. Since winning the election Trump’s bizarre behaviour combined with his delusional ideas continually reinforces the fact that he is not fit to rule America and the main aid here was Facebook, which propelled the success of his election undermining the government (Bump 2018, p.1-2). Another factor is not adequately allowing individuals the right to vote. The devastating impact, which media has on our democracy is still present. Individuals can vote for individuals based on certain factors, such as how their ideology matches with the running candidate or something as fickle as admiring the appearance of the candidate. This can lead to bias where an individual is more likely to pick a candidate if their beliefs are aligned with theirs (Caselli, F 2007, pp1-3) These factors may not even have anything to do with how capable and well suited they are for the job. In the case of America, this worsened the fact that many states where Trump’s opposition received their votes were \"slave states\". There was an agreement made in the US constitution where every enslaved individual would only count as 35ths of a person (Acharya, A et al 2015, pp.4-7). This meant that even if more votes were obtained by other political candidates they would count as lesser votes overall, reducing their viability. In addition to this, there are profound issues when it comes to the topic of elite ownership and media power. Many individuals in the ruling class vigorously compete for power and ownership, which include the self-regulating ability to overcome democratic blocks (Marx 2010[1867] pp.8- 11). These individuals, known as the elite of society, often have a significant role to play in the media and the various ways that individuals, by certain messages, are susceptible to whatever the outlet portrays. They can use the controlling stakes they have in companies to get across a message that they want or control elements of news programs, newspapers and magazines all to the detriment of the working class and the surrounding institutions of society. Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Rupert Murdoch to name a few individuals who have bought controlling shares in media outlets. Rupert Murdoch, it can be said that he simply has too much power over the British state. (Helm, T et al 2011, pp1). Between them, they own media companies such as the Washington post and the Wall Street Journal, only further emphasising how the elite can hinder democracy. A sizeable number of shares bought by an individual would leave a company’s rule to one individual, especially with social media companies (Mills, C.W 1959:3-27). In this case, the media is hindering democracy since it is allowing certain individuals to misuse and manipulate public resources. This is because considering the amount of power that individuals can obtain over public and private sectors, to the point where they can influence and predict whom you vote for via subliminal messaging or manipulating your data to benefit their agendas. They can even go the extent of using your data to predict with a high degree of accuracy the way you will behave and the resultant impact on democracy. For example, the analytic data that Facebook collected and how it assisted Trump’s election. The possibilities are innumerous as to how they can exert their power. As a result, unethical practices are perpetuated, and the consequence is even more power and control which leads to a vicious cycle whereby the elite act in favour of the action which will provide them with the most benefit. These processes cripple democracy and making it feel more like a bureaucracy. Alternatively, even though the media can hinder democracy, there are ways that the media can support it, even strengthening it. One of these ways is that it protects the interest of its members. Democracy is unique in the sense that it allows people to get personally involved within their government. One way to achieve this is through social media platforms. In this way, the public have a sense of autonomy and a voice to speak up for themselves as to how they would prefer the running of their country. The choice is solely theirs as to whom they would want to elect depending on a wide range of reasons. One reason could be they think about who could, in the best way, represent their interests as well as benefit the country. Thus, giving the people free rein to choose whatever they like which also means that they could choose to not vote at all if they so wish. Everyone’s opinions, through their votes, are included. This is regardless of them being in the majority or not, which appeases the public and makes them more amiable to the idea of democracy (Caplan 2007, pp.3-7) Moreover, promoting equality positively is significantly beneficial to democracy. Through using a democratic system, which connects relationally with media, a person is free to explore differentiating arguments of the running candidates, a party’s manifesto details and any other details they could ever want to know. The fairness of this process is further emphasised by the fact that, regardless of social or economic background, public opinion is given. Even if you are wealthy or poor, have a lavish or humble lifestyle, under democracy your rights to vote are equal. Media only enhances the available opportunities. As a result, giving the liberal opportunity to engage in a political process in which you feel inclined towards since in the pure sense of democracy there is no bias or favouritisms. The media, being the main means of mass communication, is an enabler for democracy as having more educated voters can lead to a more legitimate government. Due to this media encourages mass participation and extends the reach that democracy can have over a country. This is beneficial as the institutions surrounding society also get strengthened as a result of the positive and consistent messages being promoted (Parsons 1992[1951] pp.45-51).Additionally, as larger numbers involved within a democracy means that a fairer and more representative process can take place and having an unrestricted, educated and varied choice enhances this. Thus, as individuals can make an informed decision how they want to engage in democratic practices, there is a higher degree of transparency within the government and that encourages more trust and in turn, makes democracy as fair and just of a system as possible (Katona, 2015 pp.359-394) For example, during elections there are several messages given about institutions, using the medium of media, such as education and health care. These include ideas such as improving the levels of education by developing a better curriculum and allocating more resources to ensure that students have a better overall quality of learning. Also, regarding the health care system the promise of more nurses, to improve the quality of service. Via this method, individuals engage within their political environment more if they know they are going to benefit as a result. So, as the surrounding institutions that underpin society strengthen, society becomes more stable. These institutions work synergistically building momentum of one another to reach a common social goal, stability (Canon, W.B 1987, pp.170-176). Thus, making it unavoidable for democracy to improve as well. Within a country, the group with the power to govern a country and its business is the government. This entity uses the tool of media to aid them in bettering the quality of democracy for everyone and strive to withhold the principles that their position stands for, which include the responsibilities they have to their nation. To hinder the monopoly of authorities, democracy needs to flourish. The state assists with this as the elected leaders are only in power for a certain period, so it is in their best interest to enforce the successful delivery of their promised policies, which benefit the people as well as their tenure but only if they are willing to do so. They are varied ways and methods in which they monopolise authority, a few of these being price capping and quality regulation (Bourdieu 1991[1982 pp.242-245]).Without the latter businesses would continuously put prices higher at a competitive rate leading to a decline in consumer welfare as well as lead to inefficiency. With the former, they can check the provision of good quality service as leaving businesses to their own devices will result in reluctance to keep the standards high. All this resulting in more stable democratic institutions. Nonetheless, government institutions, like any other institutions, are susceptible to exploitation as the elected use their position to support their own agenda, often using illegitimate means to get ahead. Furthermore, a beneficial point for media supporting democracy is that the structure of democracy works to reduce exploitation by spreading out the power that the role gives through bodies or committees who oversee the individual making sure no one has overarching power over the system. It is the fact that this task allows for easy power distribution, giving an equal opportunity for all (Gündemir, S. et al. 2017, pp.34-41). Within the government, the component of freedom usually allows individuals to act however, they want so long it is not at the detriment of others. Inside the structure of democracy, the population is free to act in any way they desire to seek any result. However, legal barriers restrict them, as they cannot go out of their way to harm another without repercussions. This governing structure grants the opportunity to pursue different careers and opportunities as well as giving a genuine voice to the people. Media is the thing that encourages such diversity, as you are free to express your own opinion and determine many lifestyle choices. Neither the communication tool, known as the media, is all-knowing nor is it useless. This tool can be capable of a vast amount such as altering the state and nature of dynamic relations within society for the better alongside mistaking acts and events creating a strain within society (Corner, 2011, pp.27-30). (For example) Due to the reasons mentioned, media can be a force for progressive change as well as a hindrance. It is safe to say that the media has a pivotal part to play within society, serving a variety of functions, and has multiple uses. Previously, having seen that the media can help the development of democracy, via methods such as promoting equality and the interest as citizens, individual trust within this process increases. Moreover, knowing that the media has the capacity to obstruct democracy. I am going to propose the argument that the media can neither endanger nor support democracy because it does not hold any power in and of itself. This communication outlet is merely the space in which power resides (Castells, 2009, pp.193). Therefore, media is not the chief proponent but merely hosts the interplay of power, control and dominance. It opens a vast space where people can come and hold power in areas such as business and politics (Freedman a, 2014, pp.11). Communication networks are central to this process and are key sources in society for it to hold power. The media agents involved help to spread this diverse message and engage in this with the end goal of altering the nature of the state (Castells, 2009, pp. 302-3). The problem has never been determining media’s influence with assisting or deteriorating the economic situation, it is more to do with who occupies and aggregates the larger sources of information and the amount of space they take within this network. Media’s main strength comes from the intertwining of various communication networks such as business, finance etc. Media weakens by the absence of news existing in some form or another within this domain. If there is nothing to occupy the space, then the impact of media is lackluster (Castells,2009, pp.194-195). Media cannot hold power over individuals of its own accord, it requires the strategic implementation of information from a combination of areas compiled into one place which then goes on to infiltrate all elements of social life. Conclusively, the relationship between media and democracy is extensive and far-reaching. Power, being ubiquitous in nature, seeps into the depths of media outlets and political institutions such as democracy. The power of media transcends merely control and is something far more perplexing. Even though we can see ways that media can assist and hinder democracy, its actual role is far greater and bewildering. I propose that more research is needed into the true nature of media and the way that its role functionally relates to different institutions, as well as the devastating impact it can have on society."

      "raw_text": "Abstract <nl>59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). <nl>Introduction<nl>The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop’s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). <nl>This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986).

      "fixed_text": "Abstract 59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). Introduction The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop’s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The interference Stroop effect demonstrated further led to the development of the Stroop Test. Literature suggests that this is a consistent effect, with results of the Stroop test having high reliability (Siegrist, 1995). This gives rise to the hypothesis that the reaction time for the incongruent condition, where the words and font colour are different, will be longer than the congruent condition. Method Participants: 59 undergraduate psychology students from their first year at Aston University were recruited for this experiment via opportunity sampling. Design: The design was repeated measures and the independent variable was the congruency of the font colour and the meaning of the word itself, with two levels being congruent and incongruent. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) for participants to name the font colour in each condition. Materials: PsychoPy was used to implement the design of the experiment and collect reaction time data. The stimulus words for the congruent condition were ‘red’ in a red font, ‘green’ in a green font, and ‘blue’ in a blue font. The stimulus words for the incongruent condition were ‘red’ in a green font, ‘green’ in a blue font, and ‘blue’ in a red font. The response options available were the left arrow for red, the up arrow for green, and the right arrow for blue. Procedure: Participants gave informed consent prior to conducting the experiment. They were instructed to identify the colour of the font the word was printed in, by pressing the corresponding responses on the keyboard. The stimuli were presented in a randomised and counterbalanced order. Participants saw the 6 stimulus types 10 times, with 60 trials in total. They then identified the colour of the font of the words by pressing the keyboard as fast as possible, with the keyboard response signalling the next trial. The reaction times for each trial were stored and saved for further analysis. Results Table 1. As the hypothesis suggested, the mean for the incongruent condition is higher than the congruent condition (Table 1). The low standard deviations show that results did not vary highly in both conditions, suggesting that results may be consistent within each condition. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in reaction times between incongruent and congruent conditions at a 95% confidence level (Z= -3.638, p= .001). Discussion The research hypothesis was supported as the reaction time for the incongruent condition was significantly longer than that of the congruent condition, which was consistent with previous research by Stroop (1935). A limitation of the study was the small sample size and type of participants tested, as the results from only 59 undergraduate psychology students fail to produce an accurate representation of the general population. This is shown by Hackshaw (2008), explaining that small sample sizes produce results which overestimate the magnitude of the difference. To improve this, a wider sample size extending outside of the university would be required to assess whether the results are truly reliable. Additionally, the risk of demand characteristics due to the Stroop test being well-known may mean that participants would deliberately take a longer time to identify the colour of the font in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. Research participants are likely to hypothesise an aim of the study when they are aware that they are being observed (Hogg and Cooper, 2007). This could be remedied by introducing a pilot study where participants are asked about their perception of the aim of the study upon completion, allowing for the adaptation of the instructions and presentation of stimuli according to their responses.

      "raw_text": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party’s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.<nl><nl>Blair’s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown’s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government’s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters’ views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn’s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders’ policies.<nl><nl>In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours’ appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown’s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author’s personal opinion being a large influence.<nl><nl>After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. ‘Clause IV’ of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers’ rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well.<nl><nl>This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair’s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn’t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to ‘get better’ over the following year. At the same time, the government’s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements – the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the Blair–Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for Blair to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election.<nl><nl>The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair’s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments’ pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government’s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene.<nl><nl>Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair’s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister’s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years – and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour – an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than £150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. <nl><nl>Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour’s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour’s support for business with the defence of the party’s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called ‘predatory’ and ‘responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour’s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over £2m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing.<nl><nl>\"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he’s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services – a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from £9,000 to £6,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party – both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO’s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers’ rights.<nl><nl>In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn’t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation. Thus, to conclude, the Labour Party has been redefined to a large extent with several shifts throughout the political spectrum over the years.",
      "fixed_text": "Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party’s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.

      "raw_text": "Comprehending behaviour has been a motive for psychologists and they have perspectives which explain human behaviour. I intend to discuss the psychoanalytic and biological perspective.<nl><nl>The biological perspective focuses on the nature within the nature vs nurture debate. The debate is the question whether our behaviour as humans is predetermined by genetics or is governed by our environment(prenatal and during one’s life). The perspective focuses on the significance of genes, brain physiology and neurochemistry.Overall,it examines; emotions, thoughts and behaviour in a physical point of view. <nl><nl>The first assumption of the biological approach is brain physiology affects behaviour and thoughts;the brain has many different parts and these parts affecting different behaviours. This is localisation of brain function- this has been supported by early research e.g Wernicke and Broca as well as more recent methods such as neuro brain imaging.Broca's area is found in the left inferior frontal gyrus and Wernicke's area is located in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus. The Broca’s area discovered by Paul Broca in 1861 (Dronkers et al, 2007) is related to the production of speech damage to this area results in Broca’s aphasia, sufferers will struggle in terms of producing speech but not comprehension. Wernicke’s area, discovered by Carl Wernicke 1864 (Robson et al, 2014) is responsible for understanding of speech, someone with Wernicke’s aphasia will struggle understanding of speech but will be able to speak, though speech may not be fluent. Showing that brain physiology does affect behaviour and there are different parts responsible. Neurotransmitter activity also affect behaviour  biological psychologists have used research on mental disorders to support this, for example the dopamine hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia is caused by too much dopamine or too much dopamine receptors. (Desbonnet, in Handbook of Behavioral Neuroscience, 2016)<nl><nl>The second assumption is the idea that behaviour is inherited, twin studies are used  to study this as well as adoption studies, as you’re more likely able to tell the significance of genes (twin studies).Research on mental disorders such as depression has supported this; concordance rates of major depressive disorder amongst 177 twins between 1948 and 1976 showed that monozygotic twins (identical) had a rate of 46% whereas dizygotic twins had a rate of 20% (McGuffin P, Katz R, Watkins S, Rutherford J.1996).Showing the significance genes component in behaviour and how as humans we are genetically disposed to acting a certain way or having particular disorders. <nl><nl>As the biological approach looks at psychology in a physical light, it is regarded to be the most scientific approach, using empirical methods to gather information and leading them to have quantitative results. The approach’s use of brain scanning techniques which include; electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) and event related potentials (ERP)(Xue et al, 20120). These have been proven effective and the activity of the brain can be successfully observed. Such techniques have been exceptionally useful, e.g on localisation of function, fMRI scans produce brain maps showing which parts of the brain are most active during a task, this is done by measuring the haemodynamic response to active neurons. Where there are more active neurons indicates the parts of the brain which are active.<nl><nl>In addition, the approach has been successful in terms of its therapies, the use of drug therapy and its effect on one’s biochemistry. As the biological explanation for schizophrenia states that the cause of the disorder is too much dopamine or too much dopamine receptors, drug treatments follow from this. An example is the effect of antipsychotic drugs on patients with schizophrenia; both typical and anti typical antipsychotics (AAP) work by affecting dopamine and serotonin activity in the brain- however AAPs are more widely used as they have less side effects on patients. Clozapine, is an example and blocks serotonin, but AAPs in general work by affecting D2 receptors in the limbic system, in contrast to typical antipsychotics they do not affect other receptors. Research shows that both the first generation and second generation antipsychotics have positive effects on reducing schizophrenia symptoms. Earlier research by Awad and Voruganti et al. showed how 85% of patients benefited from taking lurasidoe, an AAP.(Awad et al, 2016).The psychoanalytic perspective introduced was introduced by Sigmund Freud. He put forward the idea that human behaviour is influenced by unconscious thoughts that we are actually not able to access however, these unconscious thoughts affect behaviour.This leads to an internal conflict within the mind. Additionally, Freud believed all behaviour and feelings within adults is a consequence of childhood experiences whether these experiences are remembered or not they ‘live’ in the unconscious part of the mind. The perspective takes into account the both sides of the nature and nurture debate as the drives within us are innate and ultimatley we are born with them e.g hunger, sex and aggression. However the fact childhood experiences affect adult behaviour, sides with nurture debate. <nl><nl>One of the main assumptions of the psychoanalytic perspective is the idea of a tripartite personality, Freud believed that all three develop at different stages in childhood. <nl>The id is the component of that we’re born with, it’s concerned with pleasure; food and sleep etc and seeks immediate gratification.It is described as ‘selfish’. The ego develops after, within three years of life- this component is based on the reality principle, it makes realistic decisions. Last to develop around 5 years of age is the super-ego, this acts as the ‘conscience’ out of all the three parts, it rationalises with the ego’s decisions- it does this by instilling moral on the go, these morals are societal rules but also the values that we have been brought up with influenced by parents. Complying with these rules results in feelings of pleasure and pride whereas going against these internalised rules leads to feelings of displeasure and guilt. These three parts of the psyche (personality) cause an internal conflict(Schultz&amp;Schultz, 2011, page 288) so Freud put forward the idea of Defense Mechanisms, these are five ways which we use to reduce the internal conflict:repression, denial, projection, displacement and sublimation. Projection is a common one where someone almost places their embarrassment onto someone else; for example, for example when you have disappointed someone and you are aware you are in the wrong, you may decide to blame them when they have done nothing wrong. Sublimation on the other hand is thought to have positive effects; this is where the negative feelings(the id’s demands) are turned into positive actions, someone who may have control issues and  may decide to be a store manager to exert this power on others in a positive way.<nl><nl>Another assumption of the psychoanalytic approach is that humans develop through Psychosexual stages during the progression of the tripartite personality. He proposed 5 stages; oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital. Within each stage, issues could arise- the issue is fixation. This idea of fixation can lead to psychological issues in adult feelings and behaviour. The oral stage is between birth and the age of an infant depends on the caregiver for feeding and the infant depends on feeding for gratification. The issue is arises when weaning becomes a problem, the caregiver should allow the infant to become less dependent, if this does not happen fixation occurs. As a consequence in adult life the individual will have dependency issues, for example clingy behaviour in relationships, additionally they’ll develop issues such as binge drinking, smoking or nail biting. The anal stage is during this stage of 18mths to  3.5 yeas. Parents should encoruage children to be able to control (urinating and defacating), if this is not overall a positive experience this will lead to either an anal retentive personality as an adult or an anal explusive personality. An anal-retentive individual would be very rigid and also very obsessed with cleanliness, this is because their caregiver during the anal stage may have been very strict and not providing any praise. The opposite would be an anal-expulsive adult who is diorganised and untidy; a consequence of lax guidance from the caregiver during the anal stage. The genital stage is the final stage, starting from puberty and into adulthood (Elkatawneh, Freud’s Psycho-Sexual Stages of Development, 2013) <nl><nl>Both the approaches have proven to be very applicable and have had application within the clinical field, this is a huge similarity between the two. The psychoanalytic perspective has produced therapies such as psychoanalysis.This  attempts to delve into the unconscious(feelings,memories or motives that are repressed) of the psyche by analysing the individual’s present behaviour. The individual is encouraged to look back into childhood for any trauma or occurrences that are affecting the present behaviour. It is usually used to treat depression, emotional disturbances etc. Similarly, the biological perspective has assisted in treating similar disorders such as depression through antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) this is a medication that increases serotonin, reducing depression symptoms.(Jain, Neurology Medlink 2009)<nl><nl>A difference between the approaches is that the psychoanalytic is not scientific whereas the biological is a scientifically credible approach as it uses scientific ways of  measurement; collecting data which empirical e.g through brain scanning techniques this means measurements are objective. Studies are conducted in controlled lab settings which are replicable and reliable, as a result this makes the approach a nomothetic as the results can be generalised and laws can be made from results. In contrast the psychoanalytic approach is not falsifiable. Freud’s assumptions can not be proved wrong, as they can not be scientifically tested or measured. This results in the psychoanalytic perspective being idiographic as there’s emphasis on one’s personal experience he also focused on case studies meaning results can’t be generationalised to produce laws as they’re too subjective.<nl><nl>To summarize, both perspectives are deterministic; the biological suggesting human behaviour is a result of our genetics,brain physiology and neuro chemistry therefore we have no free will. The psychoanalytical suggests behaviour is a consequence of upbringing as the psych is completely developed by six years of age, so both do not take into account the role of free will. Furthermore, the two perspectives continue to impact society in a positive way improving understanding of behaviour.",

An example is the effect of antipsychotic drugs on patients with schizophrenia; both typical and anti typical antipsychotics (AAP) work by affecting dopamine and serotonin activity in the brain- however AAPs are more widely used as they have less side effects on patients. Clozapine, is an example and blocks serotonin, but AAPs in general work by affecting D2 receptors in the limbic system, in contrast to typical antipsychotics they do not affect other receptors. Research shows that both the first generation and second generation antipsychotics have positive effects on reducing schizophrenia symptoms. Earlier research by Awad and Voruganti et al. showed how 85% of patients benefited from taking lurasidoe, an AAP.(Awad et al, 2016).The psychoanalytic perspective introduced was introduced by Sigmund Freud. He put forward the idea that human behaviour is influenced by unconscious thoughts that we are actually not able to access however, these unconscious thoughts affect behaviour.This leads to an internal conflict within the mind. Additionally, Freud believed all behaviour and feelings within adults is a consequence of childhood experiences whether these experiences are remembered or not they ‘live’ in the unconscious part of the mind. The perspective takes into account the both sides of the nature and nurture debate as the drives within us are innate and ultimatley we are born with them e.g hunger, sex and aggression. However the fact childhood experiences affect adult behaviour, sides with nurture debate. One of the main assumptions of the psychoanalytic perspective is the idea of a tripartite personality, Freud believed that all three develop at different stages in childhood. The id is the component of that we’re born with, it’s concerned with pleasure; food and sleep etc and seeks immediate gratification.It is described as ‘selfish’. The ego develops after, within three years of life- this component is based on the reality principle, it makes realistic decisions. Last to develop around 5 years of age is the super-ego, this acts as the ‘conscience’ out of all the three parts, it rationalises with the ego’s decisions- it does this by instilling moral on the go, these morals are societal rules but also the values that we have been brought up with influenced by parents. Complying with these rules results in feelings of pleasure and pride whereas going against these internalised rules leads to feelings of displeasure and guilt. These three parts of the psyche (personality) cause an internal conflict(SchultzandSchultz, 2011, page 288) so Freud put forward the idea of Defense Mechanisms, these are five ways which we use to reduce the internal conflict:repression, denial, projection, displacement and sublimation. Projection is a common one where someone almost places their embarrassment onto someone else; for example, for example when you have disappointed someone and you are aware you are in the wrong, you may decide to blame them when they have done nothing wrong. Sublimation on the other hand is thought to have positive effects; this is where the negative feelings(the id’s demands) are turned into positive actions, someone who may have control issues and may decide to be a store manager to exert this power on others in a positive way. Another assumption of the psychoanalytic approach is that humans develop through Psychosexual stages during the progression of the tripartite personality. He proposed 5 stages; oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital. Within each stage, issues could arise- the issue is fixation. This idea of fixation can lead to psychological issues in adult feelings and behaviour. The oral stage is between birth and the age of an infant depends on the caregiver for feeding and the infant depends on feeding for gratification. The issue is arises when weaning becomes a problem, the caregiver should allow the infant to become less dependent, if this does not happen fixation occurs. As a consequence in adult life the individual will have dependency issues, for example clingy behaviour in relationships, additionally they’ll develop issues such as binge drinking, smoking or nail biting. The anal stage is during this stage of 18mths to 3.5 yeas. Parents should encoruage children to be able to control (urinating and defacating), if this is not overall a positive experience this will lead to either an anal retentive personality as an adult or an anal explusive personality. An anal-retentive individual would be very rigid and also very obsessed with cleanliness, this is because their caregiver during the anal stage may have been very strict and not providing any praise. The opposite would be an anal-expulsive adult who is diorganised and untidy; a consequence of lax guidance from the caregiver during the anal stage. The genital stage is the final stage, starting from puberty and into adulthood (Elkatawneh, Freud’s Psycho-Sexual Stages of Development, 2013) Both the approaches have proven to be very applicable and have had application within the clinical field, this is a huge similarity between the two. The psychoanalytic perspective has produced therapies such as psychoanalysis.This attempts to delve into the unconscious(feelings,memories or motives that are repressed) of the psyche by analysing the individual’s present behaviour. The individual is encouraged to look back into childhood for any trauma or occurrences that are affecting the present behaviour. It is usually used to treat depression, emotional disturbances etc. Similarly, the biological perspective has assisted in treating similar disorders such as depression through antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) this is a medication that increases serotonin, reducing depression symptoms.(Jain, Neurology Medlink 2009) A difference between the approaches is that the psychoanalytic is not scientific whereas the biological is a scientifically credible approach as it uses scientific ways of measurement; collecting data which empirical e.g through brain scanning techniques this means measurements are objective. Studies are conducted in controlled lab settings which are replicable and reliable, as a result this makes the approach a nomothetic as the results can be generalised and laws can be made from results. In contrast the psychoanalytic approach is not falsifiable. Freud’s assumptions can not be proved wrong, as they can not be scientifically tested or measured. This results in the psychoanalytic perspective being idiographic as there’s emphasis on one’s personal experience he also focused on case studies meaning results can’t be generationalised to produce laws as they’re too subjective. To summarize, both perspectives are deterministic; the biological suggesting human behaviour is a result of our genetics,brain physiology and neuro chemistry therefore we have no free will. The psychoanalytical suggests behaviour is a consequence of upbringing as the psych is completely developed by six years of age, so both do not take into account the role of free will. Furthermore, the two perspectives continue to impact society in a positive way improving understanding of behaviour."

      "raw_text": "This essay will focus on how well FIFA have responded to the 2015 corruption scandal and an in-depth look into the measures they have since taken to prevent bribery being used within FIFA. By looking at different views and academic disciplines to critically evaluate if FIFA have done enough to prevent corruption and bribery continuing within their organisation.<nl><nl>Background:<nl>FIFA, an organisation people all over the world are familiar with. In 2002 213 countries broadcast the FIFA world cup making it the most watched event in television history. The reach and influence FIFA has is vast. FIFA is a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the international governing body of association football. FIFA was established in 1904 by 7 different nations. The global network and sensation surrounding FIFA Led them to generating $4.6 billion in 2018.<nl>In 2015 an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lead to 14 people being indicted surrounding widespread allegations of corruption, wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering within FIFA. There were allegations that $115 million in bribes were handed over to FIFA officials for several reasons. This case caused several arrests to be made in different countries across the world such as Australia, Columbia, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Germany. This case has been ongoing for several years and allegations of corruption within FIFA have been circulating for many more. In 2002 a FIFA whistle-blower contacted a British journalist with allegations of corruption within FIFA. Later there was a book written by the same journalist (Andrew Jennings) documentary about the corruption and the World Cup this led to the FBI contacting Jennings. Since then more and more information from investigators and whistle-blowers has come to light about bribes and corruption going on within FIFA mainly regarding World Cup’s and where they will be held. Countries were bribing FIFA officials to accept their bid for the World Cup to be held in their country. The investigation has found out that there was bribery involved in Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.<nl>In December 2014 FIFA had conducted their own investigation into the allegations of corruption however they did not release the findings of this investigation but just an executive summary. In which they claimed to have exonerated the bidding process of corruption. This decision shows that in 2014 they were not willing to make any major changes or take responsibility for the corruption and bribery that took place. These actions could show FIFAs unwillingness to change these practices and shows in the future it will still be standard practice for FIFA to take bribes.<nl><nl>2022 World Cup:<nl>There are many arguments surrounding the FIFA scandal some people argue that Qatar should not be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup as it effectively rewards their actions and involvement in the corruption. There are arguments that it would be inappropriate to allow a controversial state to host the World Cup and have such a large platform. The fact that this corruption harms so many people it breaches the ethics of virtues.  There are already red flags being raised about the 2022 World Cup and the fact that for the first time in its history it will be held in the winter due to the temperatures in the summer in the middle east. Anti-corruption expert Sylvia Schenk believes that if there was a legal dispute regarding this it would not be resolved until at least 2028 at which point it is ineffective. <nl>Between the scandal in 2015 and the World Cup that is due to take place in 2022 there have been many years and many different chances for FIFA officials to set a precedent and show that they are committed to stamping the corruption out of FIFA. One way to achieve this would be to allow another country to host the 2022 World Cup. It has been argued that this would not be too difficult as many countries have the infrastructure e.g., stadiums set up to accommodate the World Cup therefore logistics should not be an issue here. This shows that FIFA do not appear to have taken anything away from the scandal and try and change for the better.<nl><nl>Human Rights:<nl>The issues regarding the 2015 scandal are still Widely debated 2021. With Qualifying stages of the 2022 World Cup starting players have been protesting the allegations of human rights of migrant workers being breached in Qatar due to host the 2022 World Cup. The Guardian revealed in February 2021 that since Qatar won the bid to host the tournament in 2010 over 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar. However, this shocking statistic could be misleading it is impossible to know how many of these deaths are related to human rights breaches and how many are related to the World Cup. This however does not look good for FIFA or Qatar surrounding this global event especially as 37 deaths have been directly linked to the construction of the stadiums. This issue that is gaining global traction due partly to Norway who on the 24th of March protested by wearing T-shirts during the warmup which read \"human rights on and off the pitch \"in their World Cup qualifying match. Other teams have started to follow suit by wearing T-shirts raising awareness of the problem. Kimmich has argued that teams are 10 years too late to boycott. The damage has already been done and Qatar have been allowed to get away with this for far too long protests should have been taking place when Qatar was allocated the World Cup and before they started building all the stadiums. However, The German football Federation is not in favour of boycotting the World Cup. So, all the T-shirt wearing in the world will not help the migrant workers that have died or will continue to die for this World Cup or others to come. This is yet another example of a time where FIFA have sat back and let corruption run rife within its organisation six years after the corruption scandal this therefore shows they have not made major improvements or changes to stop his from happening for many more years to come.<nl><nl>Social Responsibility:<nl>It is not just a legal field that believes FIFA are problematic. It is argued that FIFA are also corrupt in terms of their corporate social responsibility. In a 2014 study it was found that corporations and companies that sponsored FIFA were disliked more and trusted less by the public and people are more likely to negatively talk about these brands with their peers. This study can be very negative for FIFA and the many brands that pay them millions in sponsorship. This could cause massive problems for FIFA in the future if corporations and brands the sponsor that events decide that they do not want to be associated any more. This is one example of how the corruption scandal has negatively impacted FIFA is brand and therefore value. Therefore, correcting and changing this public perception will be crucial to FIFAs continued success. <nl><nl>Feminist Perspective:<nl>There is also a view that FIFA is a \"boys club\". Professional tennis player Billie Jean King has tried to advocate for FIFA to hire more female managers and to appoint more females into higher roles within the company and hire someone specifically for the purpose of regulating gender equality within the company. She also raises a point that having more women within FIFA could improve the culture of corruption that exists. There have been studies that show that women are less likely to be involved in bribery and are less likely to condone bribe taking.  Data from different countries shows that corruption is less severe where women held more seats in parliament or more senior positions and comprise of a larger share of the labour force. Therefore, viewing this issue from the feminist perspective one way FIFA could counter some corruption could be to employ women in more positions and in more senior roles. However, it could be argued that this is less of a gender difference and more of a culturally based issue in however due to the global nature of FIFA this could potentially make a difference. The fact that some of these issues were raised years ago and have not been acted upon shows once again that FIFA are not dedicated to eradicating corruption.    <nl><nl>Legalities:  <nl>FIFA is registered and incorporated under swiss law. It is a very attractive base for many international organisations not only due to its location and political stability Switzerland also has most importantly a very lenient legal code and attractive tax regime. This could be one of the reasons that attracted FIFA to incorporate itself there. Switzerland is perceived to be a country that is least affected by corruption however this does not prevent organisations that are located there being involved in corruption. Article 332 of the Swiss criminal code only refers to the bribery of a public official as criminal therefore there is no criminal liability for the bribery of officials in international sports organisations such as FIFA. It could be argued that this is one of the reasons that corruption and bribery has run rampant within FIFA for so many years. It could be argued that under the Swiss federal act on unfair competition the type of bribery happening within FIFA could be criminally prosecuted. However transparency International believe that it is unclear whether this would be applicable to sport and FIFA. In 2004 the Federal Council ruled that this article did not apply to non-governmental organisations e.g. FIFA. There have been moves made by the Swiss Parliament to change the law so that Bribery that does not involve public officials can be criminally charged. This was following a recommendation from GRECO. This accountability should prevent more bribes taking place within FIFA.<nl><nl>Geography:<nl>The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates a situation where it is impossible for one country to be able to keep track and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is a billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials.  Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they denied Morocco the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than Qatar. It could also be argued that after the  bribery Qatar used to gain the world cup came to light Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco  teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco’s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Qatar’s GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco’s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as based on GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery.  <nl><nl>Psychology:<nl>There are many Psychological theories and there has been lots of research completed in regards to bribery and corruption. One of the main theories that comes from psychological studies is the trust game. This was first created by Berg et al the results from the study were surprising and went against the standard economic theory upon which they were based. The theory and results of this study can be applied to FIFA the anonymity and scale of the bribery makes it easier for people to be corrupted as there is a level of anonymity. One problem with this theory is that the study was done in 1995 on a very small population therefore the results cannot be generalised to modern society and the global society where customs cultures and values vary massively. Studies like this one tend to be studied by white men and study white men therefore there is massive gender and racial bias involved in the results of this study which reduce the effectiveness of it outside of the context of a single study.  Similar studies were conducted that compared data from many different countries to see if there was a relationship between nationality and the likelihood to take or condone bribery.  The study found that collectivism versus individualism on a national scale was the fact and most likely to affect bribery. This theory seems to line up with Qatar as it has a very large wealth divide. This divide makes it much easier for people to take part in bribes. In 1995 there was a cross national study focusing on ethics this study found that there was substantial crossover between personality values but the moral reasoning very significantly. The psychologists use social cognitive theory to explain the practical implications of this study. This could explain why some countries are more likely to be involved in bribery than others due to social cognitive theory and shared values of a society. There are many different areas of psychology that relate directly to bribery and corruption and the FIFA scandal. These theories should be able to show a way for bribery to be reduced in the future. This can be seen using the evolutionary psychology principle. This theory states that there are distinct patterns of corruption that can be seen throughout history with the FIFA 2015 corruption scandal named as one. This theory explains that social and cultural norms have evolved over time to allow to happen more freely. This could be good news for FIFA as it could explain why so much bribery has happened within the organisation and it could help reduce their blame and liability for the bribery. This theory can also show how to reduce bribery within FIFA in the future.          <nl><nl>Legal Case:<nl>The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates and in capability of anyone to be able to keep try and punish such a large organisation.

However, it is a very large and complex issue that covers many legal and political jurisdictions. This therefore makes it very hard to give definitive answer to how well FIFA dealt with the scandal. From my research for this essay, I have come across many recommendations for how FIFA could reduce bribery and corruption from so many different academic disciplines and the fact that FIFA has not implemented any of the shows FIFA has not learnt from 2015. On balance it appears they have not made enough changes to prevent this from happening again.",
      "fixed_text": "This essay will focus on how well FIFA have responded to the 2015 corruption scandal and an in-depth look into the measures they have since taken to prevent bribery being used within FIFA. By looking at different views and academic disciplines to critically evaluate if FIFA have done enough to prevent corruption and bribery continuing within their organisation. Background: FIFA, an organisation people all over the world are familiar with. In 2002 213 countries broadcast the FIFA world cup making it the most watched event in television history. The reach and influence FIFA has is vast. FIFA is a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the international governing body of association football. FIFA was established in 1904 by 7 different nations. The global network and sensation surrounding FIFA Led them to generating $4.6 billion in 2018. In 2015 an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lead to 14 people being indicted surrounding widespread allegations of corruption, wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering within FIFA. There were allegations that $115 million in bribes were handed over to FIFA officials for several reasons. This case caused several arrests to be made in different countries across the world such as Australia, Columbia, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Germany. This case has been ongoing for several years and allegations of corruption within FIFA have been circulating for many more. In 2002 a FIFA whistle-blower contacted a British journalist with allegations of corruption within FIFA. Later there was a book written by the same journalist (Andrew Jennings) documentary about the corruption and the World Cup this led to the FBI contacting Jennings. Since then more and more information from investigators and whistle-blowers has come to light about bribes and corruption going on within FIFA mainly regarding World Cup’s and where they will be held. Countries were bribing FIFA officials to accept their bid for the World Cup to be held in their country. The investigation has found out that there was bribery involved in Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. In December 2014 FIFA had conducted their own investigation into the allegations of corruption however they did not release the findings of this investigation but just an executive summary. In which they claimed to have exonerated the bidding process of corruption. This decision shows that in 2014 they were not willing to make any major changes or take responsibility for the corruption and bribery that took place. These actions could show FIFAs unwillingness to change these practices and shows in the future it will still be standard practice for FIFA to take bribes. 2022 World Cup: There are many arguments surrounding the FIFA scandal some people argue that Qatar should not be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup as it effectively rewards their actions and involvement in the corruption. There are arguments that it would be inappropriate to allow a controversial state to host the World Cup and have such a large platform. The fact that this corruption harms so many people it breaches the ethics of virtues. There are already red flags being raised about the 2022 World Cup and the fact that for the first time in its history it will be held in the winter due to the temperatures in the summer in the middle east. Anti-corruption expert Sylvia Schenk believes that if there was a legal dispute regarding this it would not be resolved until at least 2028 at which point it is ineffective. Between the scandal in 2015 and the World Cup that is due to take place in 2022 there have been many years and many different chances for FIFA officials to set a precedent and show that they are committed to stamping the corruption out of FIFA. One way to achieve this would be to allow another country to host the 2022 World Cup. It has been argued that this would not be too difficult as many countries have the infrastructure e.g., stadiums set up to accommodate the World Cup therefore logistics should not be an issue here. This shows that FIFA do not appear to have taken anything away from the scandal and try and change for the better. Human Rights: The issues regarding the 2015 scandal are still Widely debated 2021. With Qualifying stages of the 2022 World Cup starting players have been protesting the allegations of human rights of migrant workers being breached in Qatar due to host the 2022 World Cup.

In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd Bingham L.J. noted that ‘in many legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith’ but English law has decided not to adopt a good faith obligation but rather ‘developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.’ The courts in England are more concerned with commercial certainty rather than parties being just towards one another. <nl><nl>This essay will argue that the hostility towards good faith obligations within commercial contracts cannot be justified in the modern day and that there should be a good faith principle introduced in English Law. It will begin by discussing the current law in relation to good faith and explain how an overriding principle of good faith will be beneficial to the parties in commercial contracts. It will then suggest the reasons why in this day and age it is important for there to be an obligation of good faith within commercial contracts and give examples of the English law’s current recognition of implied and express good faith obligations. Finally, it will look at the general principles of the UK courts such as party autonomy and commercial certainty and explore how they can still be preserved with an obligation of good faith. <nl><nl>Good faith is the notion that those within contracts will act fairly towards one another. They will ‘put all their cards face upwards on the table’ and trade in a way that is open and fair.<nl>Traditionally good faith is not an overriding principle in English Law as the courts prefer for there to be certainty within commercial contracts as opposed to fairness. They are particularly against imposing broad good faith obligations. The reasons for this include the fact that it can cause uncertainty because if there was an obligation to act in good faith this can sometimes go against what the terms of the contract include. The parties can usually only go to court if one party does not fulfil their end of the contract. Furthermore, good faith can be seen as subjective as every person will have a different view of what good faith is and sometimes one judge may go too far and start siding with one party which would cause the other party a loss and so it would be difficult to find a middle point where it is suitable for both parties to not be at a complete loss. Another reason as to why the English courts prefer not to have a good faith obligation is because it makes them a lot more attractive to global businesses since they are one of the main countries without a good faith obligation. This allows for those wanting to get into commercial contracts to be more certain about the outcomes if anything was to go wrong. English law also prefers for there to be party autonomy as it allows both parties to be able to choose which law will govern their contract.  This allows for an enhanced level of certainty and predictability because both parties will be able to choose which laws best suit them. The parties also have freedom of contract which gives each party the freedom to enter into a contract and decide what terms to include. <nl><nl>Rather than an actual good faith principal English law prefers to adopt piecemeal solutions which are used for certain situations where it is seen as necessary. These will usually arise in fiduciary relationships, contracts of insurance and contracts of partnerships and employment. These include contractual interpretation where the courts will look at the intention of the parties rather than a strict interpretation of the words used in the contract.  Another instance where the courts might decide to use piecemeal solutions is when an unfair act amounts to promissory estoppel. Misrepresentation is another example where the courts might use piecemeal solutions. In some contracts such as ones where fiduciary duties are assumed there is a duty to consider the other party’s interests. The party assuming the fiduciary duties will be obligated to not act dishonestly and cannot allow their interests to clash with those of their principle.  <nl><nl>Within the terms of a contract a party is allowed to include an express term to act or negotiate in good faith. This will mean both parties will have to act and negotiate in good faith and the courts will uphold this term as it is written in the contract if it is breached by either party. In Berkeley Community Villages Ltd v Pullen, it was held that an agreement would be enough to create a contractual obligation for the parties to act in good faith. This approach was also used in CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co by Vos J. who stated that ‘the obligation of utmost good faith in the [contract]was to adhere to the spirit of the contract …. And to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, in the shortest possible time, and to be faithful to the agreed common purpose, and to act consistently with the justified expectations of the parties.’ There is an increased amount of recognition for express terms to act in good faith in commercial contracts and many judges will uphold the term because their concern is ensuring the terms of the contract are not breached. This means that if a party wants a good faith obligation in their contract then they just have to include one as a term of the contract but if the other party does not want a goof faith obligation imposed on them then it can cause some issues for the parties as it could be assumed that the other party may not have the intention to act fairly and that is the reason why they don’t want a good faith obligation in the contract. However, if there was a good faith obligation then this would ensure that both the parties have to act fairly towards one another which would almost eliminate the party’s having bad intentions entering the contract as they know if they act upon their bad intentions then they will have to face the consequences in court. In the past there has been attempts by judges to introduce a good faith principle that extends to all contracts. In 1766 Lord Mansfield declared that ‘[t]he governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon.’ However this outlook did not last long as the courts favoured party autonomy and sanctity of contract more.  It is useful for parties to have an express term to act in good faith in their contract as it would allow them to resolve a problem that might happen in the future using a good faith mechanism rather than use an expensive third-party tool. Having an express term to negotiate or act in good faith will allow parties to plan ahead in the event of an uncontrollable event happening such as the market crashing or an economic recession. In the event this does happen the parties will be able to discuss how they can continue to keep working with each other and how they will uphold their side of the agreement. It is becoming very common to find good faith clauses within contracts in the modern day which suggests that many people want to trade in good faith and would not be opposed to a good faith obligation as a lot of those in commercial contracts have willingly decided to include a good faith clause in their contracts. <nl><nl>Good faith may sometimes be implied by law in certain contracts as a term that must be followed. It is often needed in order for the contract to run smoothly. It is not implied based upon the intentions of the parties, rather because of the contractual relationship between the two parties.The different types of contracts it can be implied in include employment contracts, contracts of sale and goodwill as well as partnerships and contracts with fiduciary duties. Another way good faith can be implied is through fact. This is done to give importance to the intention of the parties in the contract. It is often implied based on necessity and obviousness. The case of Yam Seng Pte v International Trade Corp Ltd was significant in discussing whether there was an implied obligation that both parties will act in good faith with each other. Lord Leggart J. had agreed that the terms in the contract were enough to imply good faith and he also argued in favour of ‘the implication of a term requiring good faith in performance’ not only in just relational contracts but most commercial contracts based on the expectations of both parties. The fact that English law already has many instances where it uses pockets of good faith proves that a good faith principle would prove to be useful for parties entering into a contract as it is already used in several types of contracts and contractual relations. Many other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia have a good faith principle in place which means that it is possible for the United Kingdom to have one too without the worry of wondering how they will execute such a principle. Although, the English courts might argue that having an obligation of good faith will take away from the party’s freedom of contract and party autonomy, this can be disputed with the fact that the Canadian Supreme Court has said ‘the principle of good faith must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental commitments of the common law of contract which generally places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self-interest.’ The English courts can follow a similar approach and apply the principle in a way that will still allow those in commercial contracts their contractual freedom whilst also ensuring that they deal in a way that is honest, fair and truthful to the other party. <nl><nl>The introduction of a good faith obligation will allow parties to feel more reassured that if the other party was to act in bad faith towards them, then they will at least have support from the courts. The party who acted in bad faith would be required to give compensation to the other party in order to correct their wrongdoings. The English courts are already accepting of a good faith clause within contracts and also state that there is a duty to act in good faith in certain types of relationships. This suggests that they may be open to the idea of introducing a legally binding principle of good faith. The law has developed in regard to express terms to negotiate in good faith since the case of Walford v Miles where the House of Lords had stated that promises to negotiate or not sell were unenforceable and rejected that the opposing party were under an obligation to act in good faith. Lord Acknew has stated that ‘a bare agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, as it lacked the necessary certainty.  It was no more than an (unenforceable) ‘agreement to agree’. However, in Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras it was held that if there was an express term to negotiate in good faith then it is enforceable. Whilst Longmore LJ had expressed that there were three objections to negotiate in good faith, he also stated that these objections did not completely prevent enforceability. He claimed that the first objection had carried little weight because normally the express obligation would have been enforceable. The second objection would be difficult to determine as it is unlikely the courts will be able to decide when the breach of the term had amounted to good faith and unless fraud was involved then it is likely the court would not consider the other party had acted in bad faith. In regard to the third objection Longmore LJ stated it would be difficult to find out exactly how much loss had occurred as a result of the breach. The development in the law after both of these cases suggests that judges are more accepting of good faith clauses and they are not seen as unenforceable ‘agreements to agree’. The general view of judges in recent times agree with Longmore LJ and believe it would be ‘quite wrong’ for the courts to deem an express clause to negotiate in good faith as unenforceable. <nl><nl>It can be argued that introducing a good faith principle will undermine party autonomy and freedom of contract, but this can be easily resolved by using a method of enforcement similar to Canada when it comes to good faith. If the English courts enforce good faith, then they should limit the amount they get involved in order to preserve the freedom of parties. If the courts introduce a good faith clause then it should be ‘capable of being given legal content’. A good faith obligation would lead to fair dealing and less attempts of people acting in bad faith towards others. It would allow for more trust between parties as they will have more hope that it is unlikely the other party will act unfairly and unjustly towards them. <nl><nl>In conclusion there should be a good faith principle introduced in English law as it will reassure those entering commercial contracts that if they were to enter a contract then the other party will have to act towards them in good faith and trade fairly with them. Parties can also be reassured that the courts would help them if the other party acted in bad faith towards them. There is also an increase in the amount of people in commercial contracts including clauses to act or negotiate in good faith towards one another. This proves that many people are going out of their way to include these clauses as it can be seen as a form of protection. Many international courts have a good faith obligation in place, and it does not take away from the freedom parties have, rather it enhances their security and lessens the chances of them being scammed. This is because the other party will less likely want to act in bad faith if they know the implications of their actions if taken to court. Whilst it is likely the courts will have some reservations or concerns towards a good faith obligation; they can look at how international courts implement the obligation. This will help them to keep a balance between doing too much or too little whilst maintaining the general principles of English commercial law.",

      "raw_text": "Executive summary <nl>The following portfolio applies the six-sigma principle (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and control) to ASOS plc. The report begins by identifying which are the most important customer needs by drawing Critical to quality trees and using them to create metrics by which such needs can be identified. The mid-section of the report measures how well ASOS have met the needs expected by its customers and analyses and addresses the core issues behind this using methods such as the 5 why’s and affinity diagrams which aid in drawing out what the overall problem is and areas for improvement. The final sections of the report focus on addressing and eliminating issues by employing the 5’s and process mapping. Lastly overall recommendations are made for ASOS. Please find all relevant diagrams and documents in the Appendix at the end of the text. <nl>Introduction and Background <nl>The company that I have chosen to investigate is A.S.O.S. (Abbreviated for ‘As Seen on screen’) They are an online fashion and cosmetics retailer, founded in the year 2000 and based in the UK, London. 20 years later, the company now ship their products to 195 countries worldwide and sell over 850 brands on their site, alongside their own range of clothing and accessories. The company employs over 40, 000 s people as a part of this global operation. I chose to look at ASOS because they are a company, I have personal experience as a customer with, as well as knowing other people who have shopped with them also. I also thought it would be interesting to look at a business that operates solely online as this is the future of a lot of commercial activity. <nl>DEFINE (Value Added Case) <nl>The CTQ trees (figure 1) detail what needs are important to me as a customer at ASOS. The needs I identified were; good customer service, quality products and a high-quality website. Good customer service is important to me as there is not a physical store whereby, I can interact with the staff face-to-face or be persuaded by the physical environment to continue returning. Therefore, I can say that the integrity of the brand to me as a customer is dependent to on how well its customer service performs. If an order is not processed correctly, I expect customer services to fix the problem in order for me to decide to purchase from them again. These needs are further established by the following quality drivers; time taken to receive my order and how quickly a response is provided to my enquiries. Again, since the transaction happens online, as a customer I deem the brand more trustworthy if I have a positive experience of my product or <nl>refund consistently received quickly, and communication isn’t slow. This is reassuring to me and suggests that they care about my experience as a customer. I would further break these quality drivers into measurable metrics seen in figure that uphold ASOS to a high standard. If these metrics are followed, ASOS should be able to successfully provide good customer service. <nl>MEASURE (SERVQUAL) <nl>I asked 5 customers to complete a SERVQUAL questionnaire regarding the RATER aspects of ASOS (Basu, 2000), including aspects of the service which are tangible (i.e. clothes and accessories) and intangible (i.e. delivery and refunds). The results of the questionnaire are represented in figure 2, which outline the gap between ASOS ’customer expectations and actual perceptions once they have experienced the service and products. According to my results the areas which ASOS need the most improvement are empathy and assurance as they both fall below customer’s expectations of an ‘excellent online retailer.’ However, the graph shows responsiveness to have low expectations (in comparison to other areas) as well as perceptions. This is significant as I identified responsiveness as quality driver in the CTQ diagram. Although, this also suggests an opportunity for ASOS to be competitive as customers do not have as high an expectation for online retailers to be very responsive based on their past experiences. If ASOS implement this in the next stages of their six-sigma process they may have found a way to increase their competitiveness. The results also highlighted that in both Tangibles and Reliability customer expectations were exceeded, therefore ASOS can be said to have a high-quality performance in these areas. <nl>MEASURE (Cause and Effect Case) <nl>After considering the results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire and the needs highlighted in the CTQ diagram. I have chosen to analyse the causes behind two areas; Slow responses, which was the lowest scoring activity on the questionnaire and a lack of range in sizes as I have friends who have had issues with this when shopping from online retailers such as ASOS. In the diagram (figure 3) I have thought of potential causes for these issues; in order to identify ways to fix the core problems and thus improve the customer experience. Of the causes that I have identified, the most important to me as a customer are the fact that staff are uncertain of how to respond to emails. This is significant because if staff are unsure of how to respond then my query may not get answered quickly or with a response that is unsatisfactory or doesn’t adress what I am asking. The other significant cause is ASOS being slow to re- <nl>stock. This is undesirable as ASOS are a fast fashion retailer, not being able to meet this expectation, defeats the purpose of their business model and would make me look to other retailers in the market. <nl>ANALYSE (5 Why’s and Affinity) <nl>In the next stage of my research I created a flowchart asking the question ‘why?’ five times to further analyse the issue and conclude a root cause. From this exercise and use of an affinity diagram (figure 5), I identified and was able to group that the root causes were management related. There were internal issues regarding staffing, recruitment, training and time management that could be the cause of difficulties in responding to customer quieres and being slow to re-stock orders. To summarise, ASOS, like other companies in the same industry, often experience high turnover and sometimes can be slow to recruit new people in efforts to try and improve their retention level. ASOS could recruit internally if staff training was prioritised, thus giving staff the confidence to take on management roles when they become newly available. Overall, these issues fall under the responsibility of the Human resources department. With this information I will begin generating some potential solutions to improve the efficiency of the human resources at ASOS. <nl>IMPROVE (6 Hats and 5 S’s) <nl>Following the previous analysis stages, I thought of some plausible solutions to the HR issues that are potentially affecting the level of customer service at ASOS. I adopted the six-hat tool to analyse my options. The best solution I thought of was to outsource training for the marketing staff, primarily those that deal with customer service; however, it is important that all staff in this department have the same training to support each other where short-staffed. The goal of outsourced training would be to instil the confidence of staff and introduce methods of working that improve efficiency, without placing burden on the management staff. Wearing the black hat, (the most powerful), highlighted that ASOS have to be financially able to undertake this and consider which budget this will come from. I also considered whether training would actually make a significant impact or not, using the green hat in response, I decided that specific staff could be asked to undertake the training, if they find the training successful then the training could be extended to more departments. The Six sigma principle ‘standardise’ can also be applied here by creating posters or handbooks that can be placed around the office as a quick guide to responding to frequent enquiries, leaving time to respond more carefully to more complex enquiries. Circling back to the green hat, a <nl>computer program could be internally developed that scans emails for key words, listing these as quick enquiries to respond to. Above all ASOS should make it a priority to highlight customer service excellence in their company statement to encourage staff internalising these values. \"To win in services, a firm must develop a passion for service quality within the entire workforce.\" (Foster S. Thomas, 2016) <nl>IMPROVE (PDCA) <nl>At this stage the PDCA tool (Basu, 2000) As mentioned in the previous stage, the solution to the lack of training problem would be to outsource training. Therefore, the pilot study would be testing whether outsourced training will improve the efficiency of staff so that they can respond to emails faster. This will be done by giving staff and management a questionnaire that details the task they are least efficient in before training and another after the training to measure improvement. If a significant improvement is seen (large difference between before and after training scores), more employees across the organisation could also undertake the training. One of the considerable risks with the study is the financial ability of ASOS to support the training. In this case, I have chosen this method because it is easily scalable and will not cost much in the beginning but affords all departments time to plan and budget for this opportunity. The RACI chart (figure 7) shows that there is a shared responsibility between the human resources and managers to communicate internally and the responsibility of the training agency to provide a good service. It is also important that human resources consult marketing managers about which staff should undergo the training and make sure that they are informed. There is also accountability on the part of the staff to gain as much as they can from the training as it is primarily for their benefit. <nl>IMPROVE (Process Mapping) <nl>Six sigma process mapping is an effective tool for documenting a series of necessary steps and display of the value stream so that each step can be analysed for value creation (Quality improvement tools, 2018). Documenting process maps before and after changes (figures 8 and 9) highlights where value was created for ASOS’ customer service team. In this case the value created is in the staff training although visually the difference is not vast it demonstrates the effects of training mentioned in the previous section. Staff before training were more likely to ask management and seek approval for their responses, delaying the time customers received an answer, resulting in unsatisfied customers who do not return. <nl>Recommendations <nl>Another useful recommendations I would offer to ASOS would be to continuously update their FAQ (frequently asked questions) section. After successfully dealing with a complex query, consider that this may be useful to other customers and will reduce the workload in the long run as more customers will consult this beforehand. When a clothing item is delivered, the return sheet could also direct them to this page also. The more ASOS can engage and provide help to customers the more that this need for good customer service (as mentioned in the define stage) is being fulfilled.",

      "raw_text": "Background Information<nl>Superdrug are a UK health and beauty retailer and the second largest behind competitor Boots plc, with 900 stores across the UK and Ireland and a few European countries. In 2016 it became the UK’s fastest growing retailer in its industry, doubling its profit in the previous year. Superdrug have employed over 14,000 people across all their locations. In 2011 they launched their loyalty card as part of their ‘Take another look’ campaign and in 2015 the card was re-branded and given a new name. Presently, the loyalty card has seen a decline in the past 3 years, with less customers signing up our using their card.<nl>Aims and Objectives<nl>From the brief we understand that the overall aim of this proposal is to regain numbers in your loyalty programme and make sure that they remain consistent or rise in the long-term. Therefore, the overall objective, of this study is to investigate the cause of the decline in Superdrug’s loyalty program. This proposal will identify factors contributing to the loyalty decline in order for the marketing team to begin working on plausible solution. Some key questions that should be asked are:<nl>• Are members of the loyalty program currently satisfied with the program?<nl>• Are the current marketing efforts effective?<nl>• Why have some customers abandoned the program? What did they not like about the pro-<nl>gram?<nl>Research Design<nl>The study will consist of one quantitative and one qualitative method. The first part of the study will target customers that have left the loyalty scheme within the past 3 years. The aim is to discover why they chose to unsubscribe from the program. This will be the qualitative part of the study; a focus group, consisting of 10-15 participants, across the UK and Ireland. We recommend that the participants are as widespread as possible to avoid bias and display representation.

      "fixed_text": "Background Information Superdrug are a UK health and beauty retailer and the second largest behind competitor Boots plc, with 900 stores across the UK and Ireland and a few European countries. In 2016 it became the UK’s fastest growing retailer in its industry, doubling its profit in the previous year. Superdrug have employed over 14,000 people across all their locations. In 2011 they launched their loyalty card as part of their ‘Take another look’ campaign and in 2015 the card was re-branded and given a new name. Presently, the loyalty card has seen a decline in the past 3 years, with less customers signing up our using their card. Aims and Objectives From the brief we understand that the overall aim of this proposal is to regain numbers in your loyalty programme and make sure that they remain consistent or rise in the long-term. Therefore, the overall objective, of this study is to investigate the cause of the decline in Superdrug’s loyalty program. This proposal will identify factors contributing to the loyalty decline in order for the marketing team to begin working on plausible solution. Some key questions that should be asked are: • Are members of the loyalty program currently satisfied with the program? • Are the current marketing efforts effective? • Why have some customers abandoned the program? What did they not like about the pro- gram? Research Design The study will consist of one quantitative and one qualitative method. The first part of the study will target customers that have left the loyalty scheme within the past 3 years. The aim is to discover why they chose to unsubscribe from the program. This will be the qualitative part of the study; a focus group, consisting of 10-15 participants, across the UK and Ireland. We recommend that the participants are as widespread as possible to avoid bias and display representation. As Focus groups are costly, we thought that we should start with a small sample to begin with, if this study proves useful it can be carried over to other European countries where Superdrug operates. The quantitative part of the study will focus on current members of the program, highlighting marketing efforts that encouraged them to join the programme and discovering whether they are currently satisfied with its offering.

The predictions overall were all as expected, that certain personality types have different eating habits. The major findings of the results were the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. <nl>Introduction: <nl>Personality as said by Allport in 1961 is a dynamic organisation in an individual of psychophysical systems that create the characteristics, behaviour, thoughts and feelings of a person (Carducci, 2009). Many researchers have looked into the relationship between health and personality and have found that there could be a correlation between them therefore it is important to study more about the topic. Furthermore, by finding out about the correlation between an individual’s personality and eating behaviour it could aid the public health sector. If psychologist are able to develop theories based on the personality types of an individual linked to their eating habits which may be causing them health complications, then individuals may be able to better their health and reduce their issues from the advice they get due to research from psychologist. The widely accepted structure of personality is the ‘Big 5’ which is the five-factor model test. This is a self-report test that measures the big five personality traits, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN) where individuals have to see how they score by rating each statement regarding how well it describes themselves. After completing this test, the individual can see how their personality traits are and how it may affect their day to day life (Raad &amp; Perugini , 2002).<nl>Predictions:<nl>Based on previous research done by Lunn et al in 2014 it would be correct to predict that individuals with more increased openness will have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet would be present.  Furthermore, participants with a high conscientiousness  reflect self- discipline and determination, therefore, are also likely to have a general healthy diet therefore it would be right to say that a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet could be predicted. In addition to this, Wicki in 2010 found that stimulation seeking could explain the association between extraversion with alcohol consumption this means they could be prone to bad eating habits. Therefore, extraversion could be positively correlated with an unhealthy diet. Similar to this studies have shown that an individual with more neuroticism could be reliant on bad eating habits and prone to bad health and this is due to their general tension and negative emotions, so they use it to cope. Therefore, it could be predicted that individuals with high neuroticism will have a positive correlation with an unhealthy diet. Lastly, agreeableness needs further investigations, but the prediction could be that they could have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet, because they are mostly positive and have a positive mindset and therefore this could also lead to a healthier life and healthier mind(Johansen, 2018).<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design:<nl>For this study the independent variable was the personality traits that the participants were being tested on called OCEAN- openness, conscientious, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.

In addition to this, the descriptive statistics show that the minimum score of the FFQ was 1.50 and the maximum score for the FFQ score was 111.50, which is a large range.

Aside from the grand prize, the two other doors hold small gifts, a ‘lesser gift’ door is revealed, and contestants are asked whether they would like to switch their original door choice. <nl>The correct solution, given by Marilyn Voss, is that one should always switch. The contestant's original decision has a 13 chance of holding the grand prize, and once a door with the smaller gift is disclosed, that door has a 03 chance of holding the prize, meaning that the last door now has a 23 chance of holding the grand prize. Switching increases the chances of the contestant winning, but the problem is that when given the choice, most of them do not switch.<nl><nl>Granberg and Brown (1995) found that less than 15% of participants switched during lab replications. One reason for this may be that when asked how they would feel hypothetically, participants said they would feel worse if they lost after switching compared to losing with their original choice. Gilovich et al. (1995) found and concluded in a similar study that participants who switched experienced greater pain from their decision and explained the idea that ‘regrettable actions pack a bigger punch than inactions’. <nl>A supporting idea is given by Petrocelli &amp; Harris (2011) as they found that individuals tend to have increased levels of counterfactual thinking when they switch to a grand prize and lose. They argue that this reduces the ability to learn the solution of the problem and that counterfactual thinking influences memory distortions which has an effect on future decisions.<nl><nl>Another reason people may choose to stay rather than switch in dilemmas such as the MHD is the idea of an ‘illusion of control’ (Langer, 1975). Granberg and Dorr (1998) found that switching increased when a different person made the final decision. In this instance, it appeared as if individuals who made the decision stay or switch after an initial person, felt less obligated to stay. The authors suggest that the individuals who make the first decision believe that they must stick to the decision they made - without any grounds. However they did find that this wasn’t something that affected individuals long-term, as they averaged out to the same switch rate as a control group. <nl><nl>Even though it seems the majority stick, there are instances where people choose to switch. As mentioned before, rates of switching increase when there are manipulated factors. Friedman (1998) conducted a study where participants received $0.40 for the grand prize and $0.10 for the lesser for 10 rounds. He found the switching rate increased from 10-30% by the end of the rounds, suggesting that participants were learning to make the right decision. More interestingly, in the second half of his experiment he placed participants into one of four groups (larger incentives, record-keepers, a conflicting advice group and a compare group that were told around 60% of participants who switch win). Friedman found in each condition that there were increasing numbers of those that switched - up to more than half, but no one condition reaching 100.<nl>This presents the idea that people can do better in environments when given opportunities to understand the game. So, this could be the reason underpinning why some choose to switch, the fact that they can learn and understand how to play the game. Monetary incentives may also have a role in encouraging participants to learn at a faster rate. <nl><nl>A systematic review by Saenen et al. (2018) found that there were a few reasons why people sometimes decided to switch, including superior math skills, working memory and inhibition ability. However, they argued only behavioural performance improved and that there’s no hard evidence that individuals gained understanding of the problem. They also mention that behavioural performance isn’t consistent and that it’d be difficult to obtain consistent results, just by manipulating one factor that influences individuals to make the decision to stay.<nl><nl>The correct solution to win in the MHD is to switch and research has attempted to show that participants are more likely to switch when they are in situations where they are able to learn the rules of such games. However, switching is something a majority of people fail to do at first glance due to many reasons, including illusions of control or the value they put on their feelings after deciding. <nl><nl><question2><nl>Moral Reasoning (MR) is the process of using logic to determine whether an action or decision is right or wrong. Utilitarianism and Deontology, established from Bentham (1748-1833) and Kant (1724-1804), are forms of MR and are associated with systems for decision-making.<nl><nl>Deontological forms of MR argue that the right thing to do depends on actions’ intrinsic value, e.g. the act of lying is bad.

Supportive evidence for two systems in MR was given by Greene et al. (2001). They found that in instances of the personal and impersonal versions of the trolley dilemma (deciding whether to push a lever to save the 5 lives or deciding to push a large individual), individuals who made ‘utilitarian responses’ (to push) took longer to think, and brain imaging revealed that brain regions more closely related to working memory were active, compared to those who made deontological responses – who showed more activity in brain regions related to emotions.

They asked people how many individuals would need to be saved in order for them to push another individual and found that participants who gave the deontological response spoke about higher likelihoods of the individuals escaping the train track and low possibilities that pushing the man would stop the trolley.
