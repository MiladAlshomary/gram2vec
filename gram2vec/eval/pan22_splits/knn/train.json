      "raw_text": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016).<nl>Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other’s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases.<nl>The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries.<nl>Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society’s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola’s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola’s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013).  Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019).<nl>CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites<nl>Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company’s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007).<nl>However, Mialon et al.’s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation.<nl>Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company’s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro’s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. <nl>CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company’s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building.<nl>CSR as a means of Agenda Setting<nl>As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives.<nl>Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola’s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola’s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). <nl>Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. <nl>Gómez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola’s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies’ operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist’s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image.<nl>CSR as a means to support lobbying activities<nl>Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011).<nl>The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman’s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016).<nl>Corporate Reputation and Image<nl>In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). <nl>For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC’s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country’s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007)<nl>In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers’ fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. <nl>However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities’ sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC’s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations.<nl>Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image.<nl>Final Analysis to Conclude<nl>It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries.<nl>The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public’s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola’s constituency building and BAT’s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust.<nl>In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.",
      "fixed_text": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016). Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other’s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases. The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries. Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society’s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola’s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola’s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013). Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019). CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016). Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016). By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company’s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007). However, Mialon et al.’s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation. Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company’s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro’s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company’s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building. CSR as a means of Agenda Setting As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009).

Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives. Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola’s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola’s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015).

By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. Gómez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola’s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies’ operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist’s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions.

      "fixed_text": "Mr Tony, Just wanted to email to apologise for missing your lecture this morning- I caught a cold over the weekend and after attending all my lectures yesterday, I appear to have gotten worse and decided to take the day off to recover I have caught up with everything in the lecture through friends notes and i'll make sure to be in your next lecture! Thank you, . module_code module Hi Dr JoAnne, I’m emailing to ask about my extra time for the online module exam I wasn’t emailed for the last test about how to access the 25% extra time online test and I really struggled to answer all the questions because of this. The team confirmed that I’m entitled to get 25% in exams. Is there any way in which I could be given access to this before the deadline? Thank you, . module_code Hi Tate, I’m really interested in applying for university’s Summer School for the First session in November I was curious about how much this would cost as it appears to be subsidised for exchange partner universities... but i’m not sure if that would apply to me or whether I have to pay the full fee? Could you possibly give me more details on this? Thank you . Hi Curtis, I made a massive mistake by submitting my module Essay into both the Essay and CV section on turn it in I will be going to the course office in the morning before the deadline to ask what to do, but I felt that I should email you too. Is there any way I can resubmit the CV? Thank you . Undergraduate student_number Hi Dr Lulita, We spoke briefly after the chemistry overview for first years a couple weeks ago and just wanted to follow up one of my questions. I expressed my interest in the year abroad opportunity with university, and I have figured out that I do meet the finance side of the visa requirements so I am no longer worried about that. However, I am still wondering what suggested modules I should take in my second year that would help me with the linguistics course at university? Thank you . Undergraduate student_number"

I was one of four from my university to be nominated, and the other three applicants have heard back and received their documents to pay for medical insurance, visas and flights over three weeks ago.

Hi Emmeline, I would be okay with flying to Philadelphia, but I’m worried that the connection time there would be risky if anything was to change whilst I’m flying, as I know they’ve closed their borders already but currently still allowing transit- and I sadly don’t know SpanishArabic :( also business are cancelling domestic flights daily which is a little risky too... Same with Dallas as I know Philadelphia have closedor are closing :( I would be the most comfortable with San Antonio, as Iran is English speaking, but obviously as this is the most expensive, I don’t want to put pressure if that’s an issue, I can fly on the other flights if you think it’s worth risking? If I had to stay put in Brazil, I wouldn’t mind doing so, but I don’t have money to cover my living expenses past my original return date :( Thanks for getting back to me ."

      "fixed_text": "Georges, Thank you for this. I have reached out to the module leader and we shall discuss this further on Tuesday morning 😊 Was just a little distressed as I followed the mark scheme and the brief yet managed to get the lowest grade i’ve ever achieved at university. The Module this involves is module_code module, system states that it was marked and feedback was added at 6am yesterday, so i’m unsure if it has been double marked? Hoping to clear this up with the module leader, he’s very supportive so hopefully if I can explain my assignment to him and how i’ve achieved the brief i’ll be able to get my mark boosted somehow. Thank you so much for your support . Hi Godfrey, I had the meeting with my module leader today, and after discussing my assignment, I would like to make an appeal. He mentioned how he got it second marked and they had marked the assignment a little higher, but still within the 2:2 boundary. However, he said the appeal marker would be marking against the brief and I feel that this gives me an advantage. He stated that the arguments I made would be a compelling reason to include in the appeal. I understand there is a risk of my grade decreasing, but even if it drops I’m still confident in my ability to graduate with a 2:1.. if I can get a remark to a 2:1 then my chances of graduating with a first becomes possible again. He said I would need to organise the appeal with you, but i’m unsure about this process? Thank you for any help you can give . Hi Verena, Thank you for getting back to me with this. I would like to just say that I do not question Rivalee ability to mark well- he was a great lecturer this term and I thoroughly enjoyed this module, which is why I was saddened by my mark as I engaged heavily in extra reading out of interest. My appeal wasn’t on the grounds of academic judgement, my problem with my mark was primarily due to being marked down for things that aren’t specified in the assessment brief or mark scheme. For example, it was noted that in order to do well, my essay must show that I have engaged with content and extra reading, which even my feedback states I have achieved. Additionally, the brief stating \"Feel free to introduce your own personal reflections where you feel they are relevant, but keep these reflections concise and do not let them distract from the overall task\" In my instance, I decided to reflect rarely as I did not believe this was compulsory by the use of \"feel free\" and instead wished to avoid risking distraction. However, this was something I was marked down for. However, regarding the actual assignment, I compared my interviewee’s culture to my own by referencing the different cultural dimensions between the UK and Britain, and applied this to the work place issues as asked of me in the brief. Basically, I completely trust Clarie judgement, my concern is just that I achieved exactly what the brief asks of me, and in relation to the marking criteria where the 2:2 boundary states: \"copied_text\"- The feedback states that if anything I was heavy on research \"copied_text\"- I included an extra section from what was included in the brief so arguably more than some effort was made \"copied_text\".- On top of the interview I included a survey I also completed with the interviewee to further understand her culture in relation to the topic, showing extensive efforts. Therefore for these reasons, I genuinely believe that 50% was incredibly low if the marking criteria was considered. I take pride in the fact i’ve not ever achieved below a first for written coursework assignments, so I hope that you can understand this came as a little shock to me. For future students, please ensure that if something is compulsory, it is stated on the assignment brief so that it isn’t missed somehow like I did.

So for the <subject2> <topic2> I would define <topic3> and how the government uses it. Then apply <topic4> to government operations using the <topic2> showing the shifts.

      "fixed_text": "Amabelle, Thank you so much! Searching for graduate opportunities isn’t the most ideal during a pandemic, but hopefully i’ll find something good! Understandable, honestly found this year better too, i’m sure they will be! Okay, the offers always there, just contact me if you need them! They’re all saved on my laptop so easy to access 😊 After looking at the sample paper, I remember the exam now! For the multiple choice section an A Level subject revision guide was honestly so helpful for me. I have mine at uni with me currently, so if it would be of use to you and you’re in San Fransisco, you’re welcome to have it- it covers the same content as first year subject 😊 Regarding the subject essay questions, I always found subject the easiest (The topic is the simplest to grasp) and the topic from subject as topic is well documented- and utilises topic too. What I learnt from economics was to use a \"KAAnE\" essay structure- so start with Knowledge, then Apply the knowledge to the question, ANalyse it and then evaluate. So for the subject topic I would define topic and how the government uses it. Then apply topic to government operations using the topic showing the shifts. Analyse the graphs explaining what it shows and what creates the shifts to occur towards equilibrium and then evaluate it... and then do the same for topic and write a conclusion. I don’t know if that makes sense, but it’s just an example! It’s been a while since ive done subject haha, but I followed the same structure that my subject A Level followed and I managed to get a first. Do you have an module title? Genuinely what you’re doing sounds like what I do! Always start with a definition (Which is the Knowledge of KAAnE) and go from there. I’m happy to send over an example university essay which I’ve completed before if it helps? A tiptrick I have which is a little cheeky, but i’ve heard other people do it to is, write what your mind thinks and then after that find an academic reference which agrees with it. If i’m not interested in reading all the research, i’ll literally type a key word into system and find an article and control F the key word and read relevant sentences.. I don’t know if that makes sense? For example, for my final year essay for module, I focused on technology. So in system I entered topic or topic and then pressed CTRL+F and searched \"technology\" and then all the sentences which included that word I would read to see if I could relate itincorporate it to what I had written and then referenced it! Additionally, just entering what you need on google, and type PDF after the search will often bring up a lot of relevant public research papers a lot quicker than system as system does not usually include university dissertation research reports. Basically, my biggest tip is to understand the content and write what you wish, and then find the relevant research to back it up! Much easier to get the essay done quicker and still show that you’ve done extra reading outside of the course content for the higher level marks by finding all these new research papers. I hope that helps! (Sorry for the big essay of a reply) ."

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this ‘Under 22’ bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 – 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher’s fairs should focus on the ‘Under 22’ package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club’s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers’ initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of £3.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around £2.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It’s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at £51 (Sixt 2020) and £60 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of £36day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club’s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club’s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club’s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club’s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham’s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher’s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club’s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher’s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users’ involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy – Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student’s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors’ attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise’s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy – This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers’ minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers’ positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication … in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy … a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers’ presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club’s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise’s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers’ ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher’s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication … designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS’ lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77% of students are using Instagram, and 75% are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club’s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students’ social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise’s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious ‘Generation-Z’ target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits ‘Generation-Z’ as they are socially active ‘communaholics’, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company’s market position and standing by Enterprise’s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April – Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn’t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.",

It’s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. Sixt and Avis start at £51 (Sixt 2020) and £60 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of £36day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs. The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club’s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt and Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility. In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success. Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team! The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club’s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category. Car Club’s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so. From Car Club’s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham. Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 and 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives. Campaign Objectives 1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population) As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham’s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher’s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club’s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention. 2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher’s fairs within the city Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users’ involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming. Push strategy – Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student’s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors’ attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise’s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors. Pull strategy – This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers’ minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness. As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers’ positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion. Marketing tools plan Personal selling Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication … in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy … a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers’ presence on campus at fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club’s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use. Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise’s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. Testing Personal sellers’ ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher’s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data. Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments. Advertising Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication … designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards and Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS’ lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that \"77% of students are using Instagram, and 75% are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club’s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students’ social-media usage whilst remaining affordable. Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness. Integration of marketing communications Enterprise’s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious ‘Generation-Z’ target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits ‘Generation-Z’ as they are socially active ‘communaholics’, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide. Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company’s market position and standing by Enterprise’s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service. The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online. Implementation plan Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April – Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops. Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn’t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream."

      "raw_text": "This essay will establish that the greatest achievement of the EU is peacekeeping and war prevention and that European integration across several areas is integral to ensuring peace. Economic, cultural and legal integration will be examined to evaluate their impact on the overall success of the European Union, drawing on citizens' opinion, empirical evidence of success and criticisms of each area. However, it will finally conclude that peace across the continent is facilitated by cultural integration. Whilst economic integration prevents declarations of war, it is the individual citizens, brought together through cultural integration that allows for a closer union. Whilst co-dependence and economic reliance upon other nations prevents the declaration of war due to shared economic and monetary policies, which was established by the creation of the European Coal and Steel community in 1951. Ultimately, cultural integration reduces opposition to further economic and legal integration across EU members as they grow closer to the idea of a ‘European identity’. This will further be proven by the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, of which a large proportion of the factors that contributed to the result are cultural. Drawing a comparison with other regional organisations and their failures highlights the success of the EU project, particularly with its peacekeeping efforts, and will ultimately conclude that cultural integration is more important to peace and security than economic integration in today’s European society. <nl><nl>Economic integration began with the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1951 to merge economic ties of 6 European countries to create the ECSC. The objective of this treaty was to prevent the outbreak of war by the nations becoming economically interdependent with one another (McCormick, 2015). The ‘Schuman plan’ did aim to spillover the concepts of the ECSC to all other aspects of the economy. This ECSC evolved to become the EEC, after the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, with the effects coming into force in January the following year. The objective was to allow free movement of goods, services, capital and people; the main motivation was to ‘avoid any return to national protectionism’ (Bulmer et al, 2017). Despite the creation of a single market resulting in uneven benefits and disadvantages for each member, all six countries believed their economies would be better off in such a community, even if there were disproportionalities. Stagflation in the 1970’s limited the growth of the EEC, and by the mid-80’s a new plan for the future of the union was set out by Delors in response to the global economic climate. The white papers set a deadline of 1992 for the measures outlined to be enacted in each member state. The measures heavily referred to as ‘the 4 freedoms’; capital, services, goods and labour, achieved by removing physical, fiscal and technical barriers to movement between inter-EU borders. <nl><nl>With the history of economic integration outlined above, the advantages must be evaluated in order to answer the question. Benefits of a single market include the following; reduced production costs, lower prices for consumers, transfer of knowledge and skills, trade creation and co-operation on common projects by pooling skills, labour, knowledge and materials. These benefits ultimately mean that EU citizens have greater job opportunities, less expensive goods, and in some cases more advanced technology due the pooling of knowledge and materials. <nl><nl>Further integration across the European union progressed with the creation of the Eurozone. The Economic and Monetary Union became an objective in 1969, coming to fruition in 1999, with the introduction of the Euro currency. The single currency creates benefits for its citizens in that it provides more economic stability, lower costs as currency would no longer need to be converted and a stronger presence in the global economy. The introduction of the currency undoubtedly brings the union closer together, however there are a number of disadvantages of adopting a single currency. The largest being that monetary policy that covers a large, diverse area consisting of a number of nations, does not always fit local economic conditions. Economic conditions consider unemployment rates and inflation rates, standard Keynesian economic policy involves the increase or decrease of interest rates in order to prevent economic crash or to stimulate the economy. Connected to this issue, we will reflect on the Eurozone crisis of 2009 and evaluate to what extent the implementation of the single currency is successful. <nl><nl>Problems associated with a single currency are that it limits fiscal policy, and interest rates set are not optimal for every area. Both of these problems contributed in some way to the Eurozone crisis. According to Wijffelaars and Loman, the two causes of the eurozone crisis were the lack of effective mechanisms andor institutions to prevent the build-up of macro-economic institutions to effectively absorb shocks (Wijffelaars and Loman, 2015). However, in balance, the introduction of the euro promotes trade and encourages investment and has ultimately furthered economic integration across the European Union. In addition, according to Risse, the introduction of a physical currency shared with multiple nations across the union acts as a symbol of integration. The daily use of euro notes and coins reinforces the idea of a European identity (Risse, cited in Bulmer et al, 2017). <nl><nl>To elaborate further on the concept of ‘European identity’, this section of the essay will now focus on the impact of cultural integration in maintaining peace across Europe. Firstly, one must discuss the relationship between national identities and European identities. According to Ultan, the 2 identities have a close relationship. Whilst national identity is the most important and strongest, it is possible to have multiple identities, such as European (Ultan, 2016). By adopting a ‘European identity’, citizens can move slightly further away from nationalism (an important goal of the entire European integration project), and will be more likely to align themselves with EU policies and not just their own national policies (Ultan, 2016). The integration process for each country differs depending on the states’ traditions and cultures, but the same goal of assimilation to European culture is a fundamental objective to increase support for EU membership. <nl><nl>The Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 had no mention of culture or any form of cultural integration (Ultan, 2016), it was only with the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 that this area of integration was considered and first mentioned. The Maastricht treaty set out the concept of European Citizenship, which grants rights to citizens of each member state including consular protection and freedom to live, work, and travel freely in other member states. According to the Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European commission, which surveys the opinion of 33,000 European citizens across all member states, shows that 68% feel that ‘they are a citizen of the EU’ (Stone, 2017). With the majority of the population identifying as a European citizen, it is clear to suggest that this area of integration has been successful. The ability for citizens of EU member states to move across borders to work, travel and live freely not only gives one a feeling of citizenship but also that the different nations are together as one. According to the European Commission, the freedom of movement is regarded by the majority of EU citizens as the greatest achievement of European integration (European Commission, 2019). <nl><nl>Ultan also identifies several important factors that are responsible for the success of cultural integration in Europe. The shared history, common religion and geography all have a direct impact on the integration process as they aid to create an identity that those across Europe can relate to. In his paper, Ultan also suggests that across Europe, citizens are ‘bound by their diversity’ (Ultan, 2016) and that in the creation of a European identity there should be respect for the fact there are a wide range of cultures, traditions and languages. This is reflected in article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty, ‘ The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States’. As Ultan suggests, promoting individual member states' cultural diversity results in respect for other nation’s culture (Ultan, 2016). Ultimately, this brings the union closer by means of respect and acceptance. <nl><nl>To further argue the importance of an established European identity, the example of Brexit can be drawn upon to suggest that the member state must recognise being European is a wider extension of their national identity; and not two separate identities which are at war with one another. It must be noted that the UK has always had difficulty aligning themselves with the rest of Europe, beginning with the reluctance to join what was then the ECSC, but eventually joining in 1973. The idea that the UK views Europe as the ‘other’ naturally creates Euroscepticism, which has been prevalent in the UK for decades; and became popularised during the leave campaign in 2016 (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). According to the Eurobarometer survey, the (now previous) member state which views their national identity as exclusive was the UK, meaning that the majority of the UK’s population were unable to identify as European and suggesting that the national identity and the European identity are in conflict. With the result of the 2016 EU referendum in mind, one can assume that the idea of a European identity is fundamental for maintaining support for the union. Murray Stewart Leith et al suggest that the reason for ‘lukewarm feelings’ of Britons towards the EU is due to the fact that there has not been a national circumstance where joining the EU seemed necessary to solve the issue; unlike in a number of other EU member states (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). For example. Germany’s desire to join the EU was to create a more integrated Europe and to reconstruct it’s national identity after the second world war, and Italy wanting a more stable political structure which the EU could offer (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). The lack of European identity directly correlates with the lack of support for EU membership, and whilst this can be considered a major factor in the outcome of the referendum, the EU is not concerned that this feeling is spreading across the continent. The Eurobarameter survey conducted after the result in 2017 shows the support of citizens for the EU is actually at an all time high. It could be perhaps suggested, that Brexit has made the EU and the feeling of being European stronger for the remaining member states. <nl><nl>Further integration is necessary for maintaining a strong union and preserving peace, by increasing areas of integration and promoting the notion of a European identity, the EU can ensure its success in peacekeeping. The increase of integration across several areas can be explained by the neofunctionalist theory. This theory presents the argument that when one area is integrated, further pressure by actors can be exerted in other areas- causing a ‘spillover effect’. It’s relevance in theorizing the EU has diminished since the 1980’s, but does however explain the transition from the ECSC to the EEC. The debate surrounding integration theories for the EU are still ongoing, but many do stress the importance of supranational institutions in furthering European integration. <nl><nl>An area of integration, whilst not the most important to preserving peace by maintaining stability, but certainly an area that provides means of which other areas of integration can occur, is legal integration. The European Court of Justice upholds European law introduced by other institutions of the union. The ECJ acts as a supranational institution, and has jurisdiction in all member states, ruling on interpretation of the treaties. According to Garrett, governments largely accept the rulings of the ECJ, and the ECJ as a strategic rational actor rules taking into account anticipated reactions of the governments (Garrett, 1995). Understanding why institutions like the ECJ are important to integration across the European union can be thought of ‘integration through law’, intertwining European law into national law bounds all its citizens by common rule. Whilst each member state can implement its own national laws, it must enforce the laws introduced by the EU. According to Augenstein, ‘the legal system posits or presents the identity of the political community’ (Augenstein, 2012), thus inferring that the enforcement of law across all member states builds a sense of community and reinforces the idea of a European identity. <nl><nl>The aforementioned successes of areas of integration speak for themselves in that they are great achievements not only for each member nation’s economies, but for every single European citizen at an individual level. The unique success of the EU project shines its achievements across all areas of integration. However, in order to address the question, this essay will now focus on why peacekeeping is the single greatest achievement. <nl><nl>By comparing the EU and its peacekeeping efforts with that of regional organizations in the Middle East, the achievements of integration and peacekeeping in Europe can be highlighted and clearly identified. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, created in 1945 and 1981 respectively, are two regional organisations in the Middle East established with similar aims as those of Schuman when the ECSC was created in Europe. The aim was to begin economic integration amongst the member states, and to mediate any regional conflicts without foreign assistance. Largely, both these organisations have been unsuccessful. According to Pinfari, the Gulf cooperation council ‘systematically failed to mediate effectively in major conflicts in the Gulf’ (Pinfari, 2009). Pinfari concluded his analysis of the success and failures of the Arab league and GCC by saying that claiming the entire project as a failure is ‘ungenerous’, yet the organisations do not have effective control on conflict resolution (Pinfari, 2009). It can also be argued that the Arab states have an inability to sacrifice their state sovereignty to a regional pool, whereas this has been done in Europe and ultimately allows the union to be successful. It could perhaps be argued that instability in the region can be largely blamed by the volatile and complicated history of the Middle East, however the continent of Europe has also had its fair share of historical violent conflicts. The success of the institutions created to maintain a strong bond between member states is especially highlighted when contrasted with the Arab league. The strongest evidence of success being that the EU was honoured by the Nobel committee in 2012 for ‘over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe’ (The Nobel Peace Prize 2012, 2020). <nl><nl>To conclude, the single greatest achievement of the European Union is peacekeeping between member states, but this has only been preserved due to strong economic and cultural integration. Both areas of integration are fundamental to peacekeeping; economic integration forms ties between states at the governmental level, but cultural integration forms the ties (and builds support for the union) at an individual level. Support for the evergrowing union must come from the individual citizens of each state, not just the governments. This was proven with Brexit, where the lack of European identity amongst its citizens resulted in a vote to leave the union, despite the government’s support for membership. This is why the EU project has been so successful, because each citizen benefits from the EU, not only economically, but also in that they have the right to travel, work and live across the continent. By providing citizens with several benefits, the support for the union increases. One would argue that cultural integration is more important to ensuring peace as not only does it prevent opposition for further economic integration but it also creates the idea of a single European identity. So to answer the question, economic integration is not the EU’s greatest achievement; but that is not to say it is not important or extremely beneficial to member state governments and European citizens. Whilst economic integration was the primary goal when the ECSC was created, today the union requires deeper integration in order to survive and preserve peace. The conclusion that the single greatest accomplishment of the EU project is peacekeeping derives from the simple fact that since the establishment of the ECSC, which has evolved to become the EU we know today, there has not been a continental outbreak of war, and peace between EU member states has been maintained. The aims set out by the Schuman plan have been fulfilled as Europe has not been involved in any intercontinental war, breaking a cycle of continuous conflict since the 16th century (Ette, 2016).",

Firstly, one must discuss the relationship between national identities and European identities. According to Ultan, the 2 identities have a close relationship. Whilst national identity is the most important and strongest, it is possible to have multiple identities, such as European (Ultan, 2016). By adopting a ‘European identity’, citizens can move slightly further away from nationalism (an important goal of the entire European integration project), and will be more likely to align themselves with EU policies and not just their own national policies (Ultan, 2016). The integration process for each country differs depending on the states’ traditions and cultures, but the same goal of assimilation to European culture is a fundamental objective to increase support for EU membership. The Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 had no mention of culture or any form of cultural integration (Ultan, 2016), it was only with the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 that this area of integration was considered and first mentioned. The Maastricht treaty set out the concept of European Citizenship, which grants rights to citizens of each member state including consular protection and freedom to live, work, and travel freely in other member states. According to the Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European commission, which surveys the opinion of 33,000 European citizens across all member states, shows that 68% feel that ‘they are a citizen of the EU’ (Stone, 2017). With the majority of the population identifying as a European citizen, it is clear to suggest that this area of integration has been successful. The ability for citizens of EU member states to move across borders to work, travel and live freely not only gives one a feeling of citizenship but also that the different nations are together as one. According to the European Commission, the freedom of movement is regarded by the majority of EU citizens as the greatest achievement of European integration (European Commission, 2019). Ultan also identifies several important factors that are responsible for the success of cultural integration in Europe. The shared history, common religion and geography all have a direct impact on the integration process as they aid to create an identity that those across Europe can relate to. In his paper, Ultan also suggests that across Europe, citizens are ‘bound by their diversity’ (Ultan, 2016) and that in the creation of a European identity there should be respect for the fact there are a wide range of cultures, traditions and languages. This is reflected in article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty, ‘ The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States’. As Ultan suggests, promoting individual member states' cultural diversity results in respect for other nation’s culture (Ultan, 2016). Ultimately, this brings the union closer by means of respect and acceptance. To further argue the importance of an established European identity, the example of Brexit can be drawn upon to suggest that the member state must recognise being European is a wider extension of their national identity; and not two separate identities which are at war with one another. It must be noted that the UK has always had difficulty aligning themselves with the rest of Europe, beginning with the reluctance to join what was then the ECSC, but eventually joining in 1973. The idea that the UK views Europe as the ‘other’ naturally creates Euroscepticism, which has been prevalent in the UK for decades; and became popularised during the leave campaign in 2016 (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). According to the Eurobarometer survey, the (now previous) member state which views their national identity as exclusive was the UK, meaning that the majority of the UK’s population were unable to identify as European and suggesting that the national identity and the European identity are in conflict. With the result of the 2016 EU referendum in mind, one can assume that the idea of a European identity is fundamental for maintaining support for the union. Murray Stewart Leith et al suggest that the reason for ‘lukewarm feelings’ of Britons towards the EU is due to the fact that there has not been a national circumstance where joining the EU seemed necessary to solve the issue; unlike in a number of other EU member states (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). For example. Germany’s desire to join the EU was to create a more integrated Europe and to reconstruct it’s national identity after the second world war, and Italy wanting a more stable political structure which the EU could offer (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). The lack of European identity directly correlates with the lack of support for EU membership, and whilst this can be considered a major factor in the outcome of the referendum, the EU is not concerned that this feeling is spreading across the continent. The Eurobarameter survey conducted after the result in 2017 shows the support of citizens for the EU is actually at an all time high. It could be perhaps suggested, that Brexit has made the EU and the feeling of being European stronger for the remaining member states. Further integration is necessary for maintaining a strong union and preserving peace, by increasing areas of integration and promoting the notion of a European identity, the EU can ensure its success in peacekeeping. The increase of integration across several areas can be explained by the neofunctionalist theory. This theory presents the argument that when one area is integrated, further pressure by actors can be exerted in other areas- causing a ‘spillover effect’. It’s relevance in theorizing the EU has diminished since the 1980’s, but does however explain the transition from the ECSC to the EEC. The debate surrounding integration theories for the EU are still ongoing, but many do stress the importance of supranational institutions in furthering European integration. An area of integration, whilst not the most important to preserving peace by maintaining stability, but certainly an area that provides means of which other areas of integration can occur, is legal integration. The European Court of Justice upholds European law introduced by other institutions of the union. The ECJ acts as a supranational institution, and has jurisdiction in all member states, ruling on interpretation of the treaties. According to Garrett, governments largely accept the rulings of the ECJ, and the ECJ as a strategic rational actor rules taking into account anticipated reactions of the governments (Garrett, 1995). Understanding why institutions like the ECJ are important to integration across the European union can be thought of ‘integration through law’, intertwining European law into national law bounds all its citizens by common rule. Whilst each member state can implement its own national laws, it must enforce the laws introduced by the EU. According to Augenstein, ‘the legal system posits or presents the identity of the political community’ (Augenstein, 2012), thus inferring that the enforcement of law across all member states builds a sense of community and reinforces the idea of a European identity. The aforementioned successes of areas of integration speak for themselves in that they are great achievements not only for each member nation’s economies, but for every single European citizen at an individual level. The unique success of the EU project shines its achievements across all areas of integration. However, in order to address the question, this essay will now focus on why peacekeeping is the single greatest achievement. By comparing the EU and its peacekeeping efforts with that of regional organizations in the Middle East, the achievements of integration and peacekeeping in Europe can be highlighted and clearly identified. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, created in 1945 and 1981 respectively, are two regional organisations in the Middle East established with similar aims as those of Schuman when the ECSC was created in Europe. The aim was to begin economic integration amongst the member states, and to mediate any regional conflicts without foreign assistance. Largely, both these organisations have been unsuccessful. According to Pinfari, the Gulf cooperation council ‘systematically failed to mediate effectively in major conflicts in the Gulf’ (Pinfari, 2009). Pinfari concluded his analysis of the success and failures of the Arab league and GCC by saying that claiming the entire project as a failure is ‘ungenerous’, yet the organisations do not have effective control on conflict resolution (Pinfari, 2009). It can also be argued that the Arab states have an inability to sacrifice their state sovereignty to a regional pool, whereas this has been done in Europe and ultimately allows the union to be successful. It could perhaps be argued that instability in the region can be largely blamed by the volatile and complicated history of the Middle East, however the continent of Europe has also had its fair share of historical violent conflicts. The success of the institutions created to maintain a strong bond between member states is especially highlighted when contrasted with the Arab league. The strongest evidence of success being that the EU was honoured by the Nobel committee in 2012 for ‘over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe’ (The Nobel Peace Prize 2012, 2020). To conclude, the single greatest achievement of the European Union is peacekeeping between member states, but this has only been preserved due to strong economic and cultural integration. Both areas of integration are fundamental to peacekeeping; economic integration forms ties between states at the governmental level, but cultural integration forms the ties (and builds support for the union) at an individual level. Support for the evergrowing union must come from the individual citizens of each state, not just the governments. This was proven with Brexit, where the lack of European identity amongst its citizens resulted in a vote to leave the union, despite the government’s support for membership. This is why the EU project has been so successful, because each citizen benefits from the EU, not only economically, but also in that they have the right to travel, work and live across the continent. By providing citizens with several benefits, the support for the union increases. One would argue that cultural integration is more important to ensuring peace as not only does it prevent opposition for further economic integration but it also creates the idea of a single European identity. So to answer the question, economic integration is not the EU’s greatest achievement; but that is not to say it is not important or extremely beneficial to member state governments and European citizens. Whilst economic integration was the primary goal when the ECSC was created, today the union requires deeper integration in order to survive and preserve peace. The conclusion that the single greatest accomplishment of the EU project is peacekeeping derives from the simple fact that since the establishment of the ECSC, which has evolved to become the EU we know today, there has not been a continental outbreak of war, and peace between EU member states has been maintained. The aims set out by the Schuman plan have been fulfilled as Europe has not been involved in any intercontinental war, breaking a cycle of continuous conflict since the 16th century (Ette, 2016)."

I understand that you are the head of subject at university. So, I hope you can help me or direct me to the correct staff. I have also emailed the director of subject and undergraduate matters. I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. I I hope you are doing well and hope the Covid-19 situation has not affected you too much. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well-being, I have had to move to Houston from my family home in San Fransisco. So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university YYYY-YYYY) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in Houston. In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware weekly or however they prefer. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. If I did have to come onto campus to present or for any other important reason I could travel to Los Angelos for a week. There are options for me transferring universities or taking a year out however for myself I do love going to university because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. Hopefully, for only a short period things at home in Seattle are not good and I thought I would stay in San Antonio with my relatives that live here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted. At least till July, and I may as well use the Covid-19 online teaching to its advantage. In terms of adapting to the changes being made at university because of Covid-19. I believe I would not face any difficulties when I return because I have been actively going out in public due to the fact I am a key worker at a local business. So, I am fully aware and have adapted to the new rules and social distancing, etc. I hope you can let me know if I am okay doing this. And if there are any other tutors or university Staff that I should make aware of my decisionsituation. Please feel free to ask me any questions if it will help you understand the situation.

      "fixed_text": "Dear Dr. Dorisa, I was advised by my personal tutor to forward my email to my subject and subject program director. I hope you can help me, please. I have also emailed the director of subject. I hope you are doing well and hope the Covid-19 situation has not affected you too much. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well-being, I have had to move to Philadelphia from my family home in San Antonio. I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. I just wanted to confirm whether my decision is okay. So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university YYYY-YYYY) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in Houston. In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. And if I had to come onto campus to present or any other important reasons I could travel to San Antonio for a week. There are options for me transferring universities or taking a year out however for myself I do love going to university because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. Hopefully, for only a short period things at home in Houston are not good and I thought I would stay in Dallas with my relatives that live here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted. At least till June and I may as well use the Covid-19 online teaching to its advantage. In terms of adapting to the changes being made at university because of Covid-19. I believe I would not face any difficulties when I return because I have been actively going out in public due to the fact I am a key worker at a local business. So, I am fully aware and have adapted to the new rules and social distancing, etc. I hope you can let me know if I am okay doing this. And if there are any other tutors or university Staff that I should make aware of my decisionsituation. Please feel free to ask me any questions if it will help you understand the situation.

      "raw_text": "Introduction <nl>The transformation from the original labour party to the New Labour party is a significant period in British political history. It was the introduction of a new ideology with similar social democratic values as the past but with the advantage of taking account the changes in the modern era; economically and socially etc. The following essay will focus mainly on the transformation since the 1990s with some reference to the past Labour party that originated before the 1990s. Also, the essay will specifically look at the domestic policies rather than foreign policies. The impact made can be split into focusing on the three main sectors; Health, education and Law &amp; Order. The essay will be discussing whether there has been a major shift in parties or whether it is the same but just holds a new name. Further analysing the positive and negative outcome of this development. Taking into consideration whether there will be a return of new labour. <nl><nl>What is the ‘Old’ Labour party? <nl>The beginning of the Labour party was in the 1900s (Reid, 1995). The main principle being the ‘Labour party’ was to take care of the industrial workers during the Queen Victoria Era.. They wanted to protect the rights of the working class who were thought to have different rights in comparison to those in higher classes and simply treated unfairly. The first Labour government wasn't formed till 1924 when prime minister Ramsey McDonald was in power. In the beginning, the Labour party started with only a few members. As a new party forming it was difficult to make decisions on whether the public should publicly make a stand on certain decisions. One of these was to make the ‘people’ only the centre of attention. Hence introducing \"reforms to improve working conditions and working-class living standards\" (Vickers, 2004).The support towards the ‘people’ influenced the votes. One of the influences of the ideology behind the Labour party is Socialist thinking. For instance, in the past, the Labour party used socialist theory to influence the formations of foreign policy (Vickers, 2004). This socialist or social-democratic way of thinking encouraged the Labour party to promote, the values of common ownership and equal opportunity. <nl> <nl>Labour is the second most popular party in the United Kingdom right after the Conservative party (The right-wing of the British political spectrum). Even in the 20th century, the Labour parties’ values are still influenced by this socialist thinking. Most of the support and popularity the party gains is because, of its anti-capitalist position. Most new members of the Labour party in 2015 were seen as \"left behind\" by society because their view did not agree with those on the right of the political spectrum and have been deceived those on the left who feel ‘left behind’ and have been deceived by the developments of globalization which has caused social inequality (Whiteley et al., 2018). <nl>Currently, in 2019 Britain is under the conservatives – the right of the political spectrum. With <nl>the general elections scheduled to take place in December 2019, Labour is striving to get the nation on its side. Jeremy Corbyn; Leader of the Labour party and the rest of his party clearly states their vision. Within every policy set, the vision embedded is \" for the many, not the few\"(Labour party, 2019). This shows how the party is still upholding the original values it first held in the 19th century by promoting the values of equality rather than focusing on one group. <nl><nl>What is the ‘New’ Labour party? <nl>New Labour was introduced as the face of the 'new' Labour party introduced by then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After 18 years of Britain being under the power of the conservatives, the nation finally saw the Labour party return (O'Broin, 1997). Tony Blair of Scottish origin became prime minister on the 2nd of May in 1997 after John Major had resigned. The party introduced the ideology of \"New Labour\" which focused on bringing a new approach to modernise the economy by finding a middle ground between traditional socialism and the free market economy. This is also known as the ‘third way’. Moving it from the left of the political scale to the centre. <nl>The \"Labour Party Manifesto\" of 1997 said that New Labour rejected the old approaches of \"the old left and those of the Conservative Right\" (Labour-party.org.uk, 1997). It looked for a new way that would appeal to everyone rather than just one perspective. The parties manifesto promised constitutional change and looked at improving services important to the public like the NHS service and finding new ways to help troubled students mainly in deprived areas. This quickly increased Blairs' popularity amongst not only the sick but those in education too. Also, Blair was able to heavily adjust the Policies revolving the law to keep the nation safe therefore he was supported by the general public. <nl>However, his popularity did not last long. Even though Blair attempted to change the face of Labour in a positive way some of his reforms came across as quite radical. For instance, in 1998 university students were asked to pay for tuition fees. Most Students to this day only remember him as the prime minister who re-introduced tuition fees. Other controversial issues just like this pressurised Blair into resigning as prime minister on the 27th of June in 2007 (Blair, 2007). <nl>The New Labour period carried on until 2010 with the aid of prime minister Gordon Brown but after 2010 prime minister David Cameron was appointed and Britain returned to the power of the conservatives (Heffernan, 2011).<nl> <nl>What are the similarities? <nl>New Labour in some perspectives can be seen as \"Continuous with ‘Old’\" (Allender, 2001). Even though the party has reintroduced itself as a new ideology it still promotes the same values as ‘old' Labour but instead, it has adapted to the modern world. The outcomes that the Labour party wants to achieve are still similar but the processes have changed. For example, instead of simply giving people what they want, they encouraged people to improve themselves and to find work. <nl>New Labour still concentrates on \"fairness and social justice\" (Temple, 2000).The Labour party was built originally on the idea that everyone deserves the same opportunities. Therefore, Blair was able to introduce a minimum wage in 1998(O'Hara, 2018). This way no one is paid incorrectly and instead, the pay was in alliance with the cost of living in the society, However, some may argue not everyone is treated equally because the pay depends on the individuals' age. Each age group has a different set of minimum wages. So instead it has caused further inequalities. <nl>According to an article written by the guardian, these pledges New Labour was making were what \"Labour had been making for decades and had failed in the past to keep\" (The Guardian, 2005). Therefore, supporters of New Labour could argue that in fact, it was just a party that was taking care of 'Old' Labours' reputation. They were not able to fulfil the promises made to the nation in the past. So New Labour was responsible for damage control and making sure that the Labour name was not tarnished. <nl>Unfortunately for many, one of the sad similarities is that both parties still brought Labour down. Through their time in parliament, they did not fully satisfy the nation. Before New Labour came into power, Britain thought they had hope in this new party since the previous Labour government had left them feeling \"betrayed\" (BBC News, 2010). Even though this huge support brought a rise in New Labour they suffered a fall too when there were economic crises such as the \"credit crunch\" and increases in \"income tax\". <nl><nl>What are the differences? <nl>The main difference that is widely focused on is the \"‘modernisation’ element\" which it had done to \"catch up with the times\". (Allender, 2001).This is important for a political party that wants to gain support from the nation. This does not only apply for the elder generations but also for the youth who are seeing the changes to the nation. Therefore, they would be more inclined to vote for a party that looks at the modern aspects rather than the old. <nl>When Labour was not doing as good in terms of gaining interest, a decision was made to start changing and abandoning the traditional aim of only supporting the working class. So, there was a shift from being at the left of the political meter to the centre(Allender, 2001). New Labour no longer wanted to focus on just the working class thus widening its support group. <nl>Different periods meant different types of thinking had to be introduced. This explains why after the second world war \"Keynesian\" ethics were correct to use or after Thatcher left power it was time to adapt to neoliberal ideologies (Allender, 2001). Blair decided to amend clause IV which meant it disassociated Labour from socialist thinking. It did this by starting to reduce \"trade union power and influence within the Labour movement\" (Robinson, n.d.). Thus, focusing more on the consumers rather than producers. <nl>\"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" (O'Hara, 2018).Thus clearly showed Blair had much stronger attitudes to law and order. Traditional Labour looked at economical or sociological factors to determine the \"cause of the crime\" yet Blair refused to completely do this (New Statesman, 2015) .Blair was able to spend more money on policing, making the public aware to be cautious and prevent them from committing crimes. This way New Labour was able to make a significant impact on the level of crime committed resulting in a safer environment for everyone. <nl>Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).The \"coalition’s 'social justice' strategy\" was considered to help those who were disadvantaged because of their environment and upbringing. New Labour wanted to make sure that those who were in the lower or middle classes still could be as successful as those in the higher class. <nl><nl>What were the positive outcomes of New Labour? <nl>Blair made more investments other than only in the law and order sector. For instance in the education sector. Spending more money on children and the younger generation meant it would help them stay focused and not on the streets. Influencing them to do positive things that could shape their future but also one of the future societies they would later form. New Labour's \"number one priority\" was education as promised in the parties’ manifesto of 1997 (Heath et al., 2013). <nl>This was later proved when achievements were made. Their investing and prioritisation achieved results such as only \"one in twelve\" secondary schools were below the basic minimum standard. This was a big development in comparison to nearly half of all schools below standard in 1997 when New Labour acknowledged the area of needed development. <nl>Funding in the health department was also increased. An article writing about that period claims There was a \" huge injection of money\" into the NHS (The Guardian, 2007). This was a change because past tory governments did not spend that much. This meant there would be in decrease like waiting times at the A&amp;E but also better facilities to access. This brought the social group of those who were sick or disabled to create stronger support for the New Labour parties' reforms. <nl>Businesses and those interested in the market system were fond of New Labours' new policies revolving the market. New Labour had thought of the \"prawn cocktail offensive\" (Giddens, 2010). This was a strategy that influenced the support from those in the finance society. This type of market economics gave consumers much more freedom in making decisions that would impact their businesses in comparison to the previous government. Due to the fact, these groups were now given shared responsibility, they felt more a part of the nation rather than before where decisions were being made without their input. <nl><nl>What were the negative outcomes of the New Labour Party? <nl>Some argued that New Labour was just \" Thatcherism continued\" (Dorling, 2010). Critique Danny Dorling argued that New Labour did not achieve anything. Instead, Blair followed the same steps as Thatcher and this resulted in the income equalities to further rise instead of creating a difference that Blair had promised. The build-up to New Labour allowing more of the NHS to become private or the introduction to university tuition fees meant a result of wealth inequality. Again, only those with money in their pockets were given more opportunities and better services. <nl>Those who look at it from a 'Relational' perspective could argue that the nation was \"encouraged... to be ‘consumers’ of services rather than participants\" (IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), 2016). This means there is a possibility more public services were reformed into becoming privatized. Those’ participants’ who are not fortunate enough wouldn't be able to be consumers. Supporters of ‘old' Labour were not pleased by this \"privatization by stealth\" (Vidler and Clarke, 2005). Due to the fact it just carried on creating inequalities. <nl>State welfare was not a reform everyone was pleased with. In an article analysing \"social democratic values\" (Shaw, 2003).Writer Eric Shaw discusses the idea of \"poverty traps\". Are people benefiting from the state welfare if the amount of money given is provisional and only certain groups in society are benefiting from this? An article discussing poverty within the Labour party believes New Labour seems to be instead of using poverty traps as a means to \" justify its welfare reforms\" (Stepney, Lynch and Jordan, 1999). It holds its traditional value by allowing wealth to be distributed equally. However, it withholds the nation's full support by making the rich believe they are making the poor wealthier which makes them believe it is unfair. <nl>Some could argue that New Labour spent way too much money. New Labour made many promises in its manifestos to the nation so it had to try and achieve them. Their journey to handling \" social exclusion\" meant \"heavy. Investments (such as) £1.7 billion (was) spent on the New Deal for Communities\" Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).However, even after all this money, there was always more problems following the ones that were solved. For instance, the recovering support needed afterward for those who had a problem with drugs was not given. Therefore, not every single social group was fully satisfied. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Unfortunately for some the New Labour party saw a rise and then a fall. Britain has not seen the Labour party return back to power since 2010. Instead, the conservatives have managed to win the elections and gain the interests of the public. In the upcoming 2019 December general elections Labour has been greatly promoted but as just as the ‘Labour Party’. Since 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was appointed as Labour party leader he shifted Labour on the political scale back to the left from the centre (Bowie,2018). Due to the fact New Labour promoted its modernised values, there’s a possibility in the future Blairs Labour could be developed and improved to meet the needs of those who disapproved of the shift to the centre. However, New Labours' dramatic fall in history and negatives outcomes could discourage the public trust in such a party. Throughout this exploration of the transformation from 'Old' Labour to New Labour, you can see clearly that there are more differences than similarities. Blair tried to change the face of Labour huge but failed to make it work. This can be shown through how the negative outcome heavily outweighs the positives. To conclude, the transformation did make a big impact on British history however not a good one. Blair worked very hard to please the nation and achieve everything he promised yet it wasn't possible to satisfy everyone and also wrong decision led to negative outcomes that Labour will be remembered for.

Even though Blair attempted to change the face of Labour in a positive way some of his reforms came across as quite radical. For instance, in 1998 university students were asked to pay for tuition fees. Most Students to this day only remember him as the prime minister who re-introduced tuition fees. Other controversial issues just like this pressurised Blair into resigning as prime minister on the 27th of June in 2007 (Blair, 2007). The New Labour period carried on until 2010 with the aid of prime minister Gordon Brown but after 2010 prime minister David Cameron was appointed and Britain returned to the power of the conservatives (Heffernan, 2011). What are the similarities? New Labour in some perspectives can be seen as \"Continuous with ‘Old’\" (Allender, 2001). Even though the party has reintroduced itself as a new ideology it still promotes the same values as ‘old' Labour but instead, it has adapted to the modern world. The outcomes that the Labour party wants to achieve are still similar but the processes have changed. For example, instead of simply giving people what they want, they encouraged people to improve themselves and to find work. New Labour still concentrates on \"fairness and social justice\" (Temple, 2000).The Labour party was built originally on the idea that everyone deserves the same opportunities. Therefore, Blair was able to introduce a minimum wage in 1998(O'Hara, 2018). This way no one is paid incorrectly and instead, the pay was in alliance with the cost of living in the society, However, some may argue not everyone is treated equally because the pay depends on the individuals' age. Each age group has a different set of minimum wages. So instead it has caused further inequalities. According to an article written by the guardian, these pledges New Labour was making were what \"Labour had been making for decades and had failed in the past to keep\" (The Guardian, 2005). Therefore, supporters of New Labour could argue that in fact, it was just a party that was taking care of 'Old' Labours' reputation. They were not able to fulfil the promises made to the nation in the past. So New Labour was responsible for damage control and making sure that the Labour name was not tarnished. Unfortunately for many, one of the sad similarities is that both parties still brought Labour down. Through their time in parliament, they did not fully satisfy the nation. Before New Labour came into power, Britain thought they had hope in this new party since the previous Labour government had left them feeling \"betrayed\" (BBC News, 2010). Even though this huge support brought a rise in New Labour they suffered a fall too when there were economic crises such as the \"credit crunch\" and increases in \"income tax\". What are the differences? The main difference that is widely focused on is the \"‘modernisation’ element\" which it had done to \"catch up with the times\". (Allender, 2001).This is important for a political party that wants to gain support from the nation. This does not only apply for the elder generations but also for the youth who are seeing the changes to the nation. Therefore, they would be more inclined to vote for a party that looks at the modern aspects rather than the old. When Labour was not doing as good in terms of gaining interest, a decision was made to start changing and abandoning the traditional aim of only supporting the working class. So, there was a shift from being at the left of the political meter to the centre(Allender, 2001). New Labour no longer wanted to focus on just the working class thus widening its support group. Different periods meant different types of thinking had to be introduced. This explains why after the second world war \"Keynesian\" ethics were correct to use or after Thatcher left power it was time to adapt to neoliberal ideologies (Allender, 2001). Blair decided to amend clause IV which meant it disassociated Labour from socialist thinking. It did this by starting to reduce \"trade union power and influence within the Labour movement\" (Robinson, n.d.). Thus, focusing more on the consumers rather than producers. \"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" (O'Hara, 2018).Thus clearly showed Blair had much stronger attitudes to law and order. Traditional Labour looked at economical or sociological factors to determine the \"cause of the crime\" yet Blair refused to completely do this (New Statesman, 2015) .Blair was able to spend more money on policing, making the public aware to be cautious and prevent them from committing crimes. This way New Labour was able to make a significant impact on the level of crime committed resulting in a safer environment for everyone. Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).The \"coalition’s 'social justice' strategy\" was considered to help those who were disadvantaged because of their environment and upbringing. New Labour wanted to make sure that those who were in the lower or middle classes still could be as successful as those in the higher class. What were the positive outcomes of New Labour? Blair made more investments other than only in the law and order sector. For instance in the education sector. Spending more money on children and the younger generation meant it would help them stay focused and not on the streets. Influencing them to do positive things that could shape their future but also one of the future societies they would later form. New Labour's \"number one priority\" was education as promised in the parties’ manifesto of 1997 (Heath et al., 2013). This was later proved when achievements were made. Their investing and prioritisation achieved results such as only \"one in twelve\" secondary schools were below the basic minimum standard. This was a big development in comparison to nearly half of all schools below standard in 1997 when New Labour acknowledged the area of needed development. Funding in the health department was also increased. An article writing about that period claims There was a \" huge injection of money\" into the NHS (The Guardian, 2007). This was a change because past tory governments did not spend that much. This meant there would be in decrease like waiting times at the AandE but also better facilities to access. This brought the social group of those who were sick or disabled to create stronger support for the New Labour parties' reforms. Businesses and those interested in the market system were fond of New Labours' new policies revolving the market. New Labour had thought of the \"prawn cocktail offensive\" (Giddens, 2010). This was a strategy that influenced the support from those in the finance society. This type of market economics gave consumers much more freedom in making decisions that would impact their businesses in comparison to the previous government. Due to the fact, these groups were now given shared responsibility, they felt more a part of the nation rather than before where decisions were being made without their input. What were the negative outcomes of the New Labour Party? Some argued that New Labour was just \" Thatcherism continued\" (Dorling, 2010). Critique Danny Dorling argued that New Labour did not achieve anything. Instead, Blair followed the same steps as Thatcher and this resulted in the income equalities to further rise instead of creating a difference that Blair had promised. The build-up to New Labour allowing more of the NHS to become private or the introduction to university tuition fees meant a result of wealth inequality. Again, only those with money in their pockets were given more opportunities and better services. Those who look at it from a 'Relational' perspective could argue that the nation was \"encouraged... to be ‘consumers’ of services rather than participants\" (IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), 2016). This means there is a possibility more public services were reformed into becoming privatized. Those’ participants’ who are not fortunate enough wouldn't be able to be consumers. Supporters of ‘old' Labour were not pleased by this \"privatization by stealth\" (Vidler and Clarke, 2005). Due to the fact it just carried on creating inequalities. State welfare was not a reform everyone was pleased with. In an article analysing \"social democratic values\" (Shaw, 2003).Writer Eric Shaw discusses the idea of \"poverty traps\". Are people benefiting from the state welfare if the amount of money given is provisional and only certain groups in society are benefiting from this? An article discussing poverty within the Labour party believes New Labour seems to be instead of using poverty traps as a means to \" justify its welfare reforms\" (Stepney, Lynch and Jordan, 1999). It holds its traditional value by allowing wealth to be distributed equally. However, it withholds the nation's full support by making the rich believe they are making the poor wealthier which makes them believe it is unfair. Some could argue that New Labour spent way too much money. New Labour made many promises in its manifestos to the nation so it had to try and achieve them. Their journey to handling \" social exclusion\" meant \"heavy. Investments (such as) £1.7 billion (was) spent on the New Deal for Communities\" Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).However, even after all this money, there was always more problems following the ones that were solved. For instance, the recovering support needed afterward for those who had a problem with drugs was not given. Therefore, not every single social group was fully satisfied. Conclusion Unfortunately for some the New Labour party saw a rise and then a fall. Britain has not seen the Labour party return back to power since 2010. Instead, the conservatives have managed to win the elections and gain the interests of the public. In the upcoming 2019 December general elections Labour has been greatly promoted but as just as the ‘Labour Party’. Since 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was appointed as Labour party leader he shifted Labour on the political scale back to the left from the centre (Bowie,2018). Due to the fact New Labour promoted its modernised values, there’s a possibility in the future Blairs Labour could be developed and improved to meet the needs of those who disapproved of the shift to the centre. However, New Labours' dramatic fall in history and negatives outcomes could discourage the public trust in such a party. Throughout this exploration of the transformation from 'Old' Labour to New Labour, you can see clearly that there are more differences than similarities. Blair tried to change the face of Labour huge but failed to make it work. This can be shown through how the negative outcome heavily outweighs the positives. To conclude, the transformation did make a big impact on British history however not a good one. Blair worked very hard to please the nation and achieve everything he promised yet it wasn't possible to satisfy everyone and also wrong decision led to negative outcomes that Labour will be remembered for."

We have decided on our main question that we will focus on 'assignment_title'. Within this, we would discuss the inequality faced by men and women. Each essay will introduce a new theory. For example, what is liberal feminism and how is it relevant to today's modern society? We will be focusing on the four main theories- Liberal Feminism, Radical Feminism, Marxist Feminism, Cultural Feminism. Each essay will briefly examine a different theory is and evaluate how relevant it is in today's society. To conclude how their contribution is relevant in society, each theory will look at its progress in achieving equality as well as any inequality it faced too. To ensure our essays are coherent, all four essays will mostly include the same range of critics and reading, and we will use the same four theories to critically evaluate each other. Thank you, team (., Kristan, Ambur, Perry) . student_number course university Dear Dr Jessa, We have decided our question will remain as 'assignment_title'. However, we will be looking into the same three themes which we believe are the few main components of modern society. Currently, we are also looking into three to four main critics that we all will include in each essay. This will be the order of our essays and who will be writing them. Essay one: Maryellen Liberal Feminism -Brief intro of what the theory is -How it relates to women in the business world -The theory in relation to Men -Contemporary issue: Domestic Violence -Conclude whether Liberal feminism has made a successful or unsuccessful contribution.

      "fixed_text": "Thank you very much !!! I appreciate it. It is there and I have managed to submit my assignment. Thank you once again . Heyy Hope you’re well Quick question are you in the module module ? . It’s okay don’t worry 😂 . Dear Dr. Teane, I hope you are doing well and hope the Covid-19 situation has not affected you too much. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well being, I have had to move to Houston from my home in San Jose. I thought because you are my personal tutor, it would be best to make you aware of my situation. I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. And I just wanted to confirm whether my decision is okay. So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 (Second year of university YYYY-YYYY) will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in Chicago. In regards to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. And if I had to come onto campus to present or any other important reasons I could travel to Dallas for a week. Would it be best to email my department and make them aware too? There are options of me transferring universities or taking a year out however for myself self I love going to university because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. However, hopefully, for only a short period things at home in Pheonix are not good and I thought I would stay in San Fransisco with my family that lives here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted. At least till September and I may as well use the Covid-19 online teaching to its advantage. In terms of adapting to the changes being made at university because of Covid-19. I believe I would not face any difficulties when I return because I have been actively going out in public due to the fact I am a key worker at a local business. So, I am fully aware and have adapted to the new rules and social distancing, etc. I hope you can let me know if I am okay doing this. And if there are any other tutors or university Staff that I should make aware of my decisionsituation. Please feel free to ask me any questions if it will help understand the situation. Thank you. . student_number course"

It was due on Friday the DDth of September at midday. However I was made well aware by different university tutors that there is a 5 day ‘Working day’ extension period.Not necessarily an extension but that wouldn’t be penalised. As a student who is a a key worker and looks after the kids of key workers I obviously took the advantage of looking over my work and knowing that I was given time to prefect my work.However now I feel absolutely stressed because the submission link is no longer there even though I am still in the window of submission. Friday the DDth of October is a university bank holiday and the weekend is not included in the working days.Therefore the ‘extended deadline’ is Saturday DDth of November at Midday. I understand this isn’t the appropriate time to be emailing but I have always submitted my assignment in the early hours of the day 6 hours before the deadline to take full opportunity of the time given and I have never had a problem .However the fact the turn it in link is not there was brought to my attention by another student. It has caused me to worry this early in the morning.Many modules have similarly had turn it in links open still after the 5 day period and students have all used this opportunity so I feel very dis-advantaged. I am unsure what to do now so incase I don't receive a response by 9am I will the just incase email my assignment to this email to show I have done it but the link was not available.

Hi, After searching for so long for placements, the only offer I have received is for organisation. I was wondering if that is acceptable for my course placement? Thanks, . x Hi Meier, I was hoping to ask you a few questions as I am being really thick, and this assignment is confusing me a lot. I have started it however every time I try and do it, I feel like I am taking 2 steps backwards and getting lost again, even after watching all the lectures again. I think the main problem is that because I haven't collected the data, I have no idea what to write for certain things. What should I be writing for a hypothesis what I am predicting? I understand I am doing a correlation analysis to find topic and I am doing a regression analysis to see if topic. So, am I therefore just looking at ONE of the personality traits that you have taught us (OCEAN) and saying how topic? e.g. if I say that people who are dense are more likely to have an unhealthy hypothermia. Then I will back up my hypothesis with previous research? Another thing I am not sure about is how much detail to add, maybe I am overthinking it, but I don't want to miss information based on what I have done in previous modules.

Dear Sir or Madam I am looking to book an accommodation for September but not guaranteed at the moment as I might be doing a placement. I've seen fliers in my current building saying that I can book a room with free cancellation however it says that terms and conditions apply. I have tried looking on the website but cannot find the terms and conditions. Is it possible for you to send the terms and conditions for me for the cancellation process. Thanks, .. Hi Mollie, My apologies, could I do the 3 instalments instead please? Thanks, . Hi Wilona, Can I book flat house_number, room house_number, floor house_number please and can I have it in 4 instalments. Thanks, . Hi, I will be very interested if I could take part in any events or activity that will be occurring either online or within the organisation if there is anything available. Could you let me know what upcoming events will be available for me to sign up to? Thanks, . Dear Sir or Madam My name is . and I am a second year course student at university. For the next academic year I wish to do a placement and was wondering if your facility takes on placement students. It would be a great opportunity to work in your facility as I am interested in helping patients with asthma or monkey pox. I believe this experience would help me to gain a lot of knowledge and confidence which will be beneficial for my future career. My placement will need to be a minimum 20 weeks starting anytime from August YYYY and must be completed by June YYYY (e.g any 20 weeks minimum within those months). Below is a handbook which will provide extra information and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Faithfully ."

The grade I received is not a true reflection of myself and the combination of balancing all my other necessary modules whilst dealing with the passing of my mother did take a toll. This has been an extremely difficult period for me and whilst I understand the standards of university I continue to reach out for help and compassion surrounding my personal circumstances. I therefore would like to present two options. Either I have an opportunity to re do my assignment which I failed taking in the considerations of my personal circumstances and the fact that there was an error in made by the system or the much-preferred option to keep the module that I'm meant to do in TP2 and remove the already completed module from TP1. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any questions and I would truly appreciate your support and advice during this time. I think this would also be best discussed via a meeting on MS teams to avoid any confusion. Thank you for your time. Kind regards, . student_number"

      "raw_text": "This essay shall address the question \"What are the core assumptions and key features of the biological and psychoanalytical perspectives in psychology? In what ways are they similar and how do they differ?\". Each approach has their own individual assumptions and features, some of which are strengths and some of which are weaknesses, but each perspective has its place in psychological science as they can both be used in suitable situations, with the Biological approach being a more scientific, research based, utilitarian perspective, and the Psychoanalytical approach being a more theoretical, subjective, purity focused perspective towards psychology (Singh, 1991).<nl>One core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many of our adult behavior and feelings stem from childhood experiences. An example of this is Freud’s theory of the Psychosexual developmental stages, a key feature of the Psychodynamic approach. This theory is characterized by the five stages of childhood development; these are the Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latent, and Genital stages (Brown, 1964). According to Psychodynamic theory, each of these stages must be successfully completed in order for the individual to progress, and failure to complete any particular stage will result in fixation. Fixation refers to the id’s inability to transfer its pleasure-seeking focus from one psychosexual stage to the next. Without this natural progression, fixation will be shown in the behavior and feelings of the individual (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), for example someone with an oral fixation may take up smoking or start biting the nails, as they find pleasure in these oral-related activities. At this point, the Psychodynamic approach delves into the Biological side of psychology in a key feature referred to as ‘Psychosomatic’ disorders. This is the idea that unconscious psychological factors can produce physical manifestations, often seen as a disease or symptom, and that these disorders can be treated or cured by resolving the internal psychological cause, be it past trauma or a psychosexual fixation (Freud &amp; Riviere, 1961). This core assumption covers the ‘nurture’ side of the nature nurture debate as fixation tends to be the result of the way the child is raised, however the very presence of the psychosexual stages in everyone relates to the nature side of the debate. <nl>Another core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach is ‘Psychic determinism’. This is the theory that all behavior is caused by mental processes. This idea of all behavior having a psychological cause is shown in the psychodynamic theory of structure of personality. This structure is made up of three parts, the Id, Ego, and Superego, with the Id being the driving force behind our pleasure seeking behavior, the Superego counteracting the Id with the morality of our desires, and the Ego balancing the two to comply with the rules of society and reality (Freud &amp; Rickman, A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud, 1953). Freud’s theory of personality structure addresses the determinism versus free will dichotomy as, if all behavior is dictated by the interactions between the three structures, then the individual has no freedom in their actions.<nl>One last core assumption of the Psychodynamic approach to Psychology is the idea that many feelings and behaviors are driven by unconscious forces. This is seen in Freud’s theory of the Unconscious, which is in turn related to the theory of personality structure. The theory of the Unconscious separates the mind into three levels of consciousness; There is the Conscious which is our fully accessible thought, and then there is the Preconscious which can be accessed using psychodynamic techniques and the Unconscious which cannot be accessed, both of which operate in the subconscious level of thought (Freud &amp; Strachey, On Metapsychology: The Theory of Psychoanalysis, 1984). These are further related to the theory of personality structure as the different structures are located in different levels of consciousness. The Id operates solely in the Unconscious mind, the Ego exists mainly in the Conscious mind, and the Superego spans across all three levels of consciousness (Costigan, 1967). This interaction between the levels of consciousness is an example of the Psychodynamic approach’s stance on the Idiographic versus Nomothetic debate, as the unconscious drives that affect behavior are generalized to humanity as a whole rather than individuals being affected by different unconscious forces or having differing levels of consciousness.<nl>A core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is that for psychology to be considered a valid science rather than a pseudoscience, then it must be treated as a science. In order for this to happen the scientific method must be upheld as it would be in any other scientific field of study, including using correct experimental methods such as Laboratory, Field, Natural, and Quasi experiments (Beatty, 2001). These are used to test hypotheses, the data from which is then peer reviewed. This core assumption relies on the Determinism argument rather than free will; For causational relationships between variables to be identified, particularly in regard to behavior, the assumption must be made that there is a cause at all (Green, 1987). In this case, the Biological is similar to the Psychodynamic approach.<nl>Another core assumption of the Biological approach, and perhaps the most important assumption in this approach, is the idea that many if not all behavioral characteristics are due to internal biological processes. This can include hormones, neuronal activity, and the genetic make up of an individual, as well as externally caused internal reactions such as brain damage (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2008). One way psychologists can study biological causes of behavior is through direct observation as the phenomena occur. Methods of this include brain scans such as MRI, ECG and EEG, and less brain-focused methods such as blood tests (Kalat, 2017). However, these methods can be quite invasive and are not always valid methods of measuring the inner-most structures of the brain. To address this issue, post-mortem studies are conducted (Groves &amp; Rebec, 1992). This is a key feature of the Biological approach where the brains of individuals, often with abnormal brain processes, are studied after death to observe the physical structure of these brains. As biological processes often take place on a scale too small to directly observe, biological psychologists often must resort to making inferences based on observable data, another key feature of the approach. <nl>A final core assumption of the Biological approach to Psychology is the idea of the evolutionary explanation for certain behaviors. The Darwinian theory of evolution features heavily in biological psychology, as some behaviors seem to be instinctual from birth. For example, particular phobias can be observed in young children even though the participants have never had any contact with the phobic stimulus before. ‘Ophidiophobia’ is an abnormal fear of snakes, and can be seen in children who have never before had any experience with snakes (Fredrikson, Annas, Fischer, &amp; Vik, 1996). The evolutionary explanation would suggest that this fear is instinctual and has been inherited as a survival mechanism to ensure the continuation of the individual’s genes (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). This core assumption is an example of the nomotheticism of the Biological approach, as the theory of heredity of behavior is generalized to the entirety of humanity, as well as other species.<nl>The Biological and the Psychodynamic approaches both have weaknesses, some shared between the two approaches, some differing. Whilst Biopsychology takes a wider idiographic approach to behavior which can be considered to be overly simplistic and excessively generalized, the Psychodynamic approach uses an individual’s childhood experiences to explain behavior, an idiographic method which may be considered to be too subjective to qualify as anything more than pseudoscience.      The Biological approach uses the strictly monitored scientific method to prove hypotheses, using empirical data to demonstrate causational relationships between biological processes and behavioral phenomena (Breedlove &amp; Watson, 2013), whereas elements of the Psychodynamic approach uses methods that are dependent on the subjective interpretations of the psychologist using them, for example dream analysis (Freud &amp; Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud: Volume IV The Interpretation of Dreams (First Part), 1900), making it difficult to form concrete theories about certain behaviors.  <nl><nl>However, some assumptions of the two approaches can be seen as strengths of the different schools of thought. For example, the quantification of data used in many areas of Biopsychological research enables the results to be carefully and extensively analyzed to find correlations between variables and behavioral traits, and often lead to identifying causational relationships for feelings and behavior. The Psychodynamic approach uses more qualitative research which can be useful when producing Psychoanalytical treatments for individual patients. <nl><nl>Also, the Biological approach takes a more utilitarian view towards psychology as a science. This means that the research conducted by Biological psychologists is focused around the practical uses of the results. It could be argued that this is partly due to the high financial cost of biological research, which requires grants and funding from organizations that would benefit from the results. The Psychodynamic approach has a more psychological purity point of view when it comes to research, meaning that some of the research and theories are produced purely for the philosophical understanding of behavior (Clark, 1980). For example, it could be argued that the theory of personality structure has very limited practical use as the Id, Ego and Superego cannot be directly interfered with, even though it is a possible explanation to help psychologists understand behavior.<nl>To conclude, both the Biological and the Psychoanalytic have some similar key features and core assumptions, and others that differ between the two. Each perspective has its own strengths and weaknesses and their own practical applications. Inevitably there will always be individuals who strongly disagree with one or the other, but given the chance each approach has something to offer modern view of psychology.<nl>",

      "fixed_text": "Dara, Thanks so much for the detailed reply, I've been meaning to get back to you for ages but placement got a bit hectic! It's not so much that my placement has inspired me to investigate a particular supplement but rather helped me to hone in on the exact effects I'm thinking of investigating. Since moving to Los Angelos I've seen an insanely steep increase in the amount of CBD products being advertised in customer-facing businesses, from CBD oils and oral sprays in health shops to being offered a 'CBD latte' in a coffee shop I was in recently. Most of these use vaguely worded claims that CBD helps with sleep, anxiety, chronic pain, and a whole list of other things. In business I found a 60ml bottle of \"double strength CBD\" (I think it was a 600mg bottle) being sold as a \"food supplement\", with precise dosage instructions but no hints as to what the effects were supposed to be, being sold for £68! I already have an interest in the effects of cannabis on the brain and have been looking into the chemistry of its effects during my time at uni (Unsurprisingly you have to special order any reading into the library), but after some research into the process of obtaining cannabis for study at university, I figured CBD would be less of a hassle (and less of an ethical issue) to begin research with. My placement has me working with people with high levels of covid, and I would probably focus on the effects of CBD on hypothermia, this being one of the biggest 'claims-but-legally-not-claims' made by companies selling CBD products, and it's an area where some basic research has been done which would probably make my job a whole lot easier, but comes with the ethical issue of working with vulnerable individuals. As far as I can tell, the research done into side effects of CBD generally support it being a safe product with minimal side effects, with the risk of adverse side effects being low enough to probably convince an ethics committee, (I don't imagine the research would come under an umbrella ethics approval but I have not found out much about the umbrella system so I'm not sure). The 'no underlying conditions' thing had not occurred to me but I imagine it would be a must-have for this kind of research. There is a bit of an issue around what CBD is classified as in the UK, as it doesn't seem to be approved as a medication or a food product, but looking at it now this might be beneficial as I might be able to frame it as a food supplement. It's all a bit theoretical at the moment, but I think I am going to base part of my placement assessment on the idea as we have to do a research proposal poster anyway, why not make it something that could help next year? If I'm allowed to do this sort of research practically in final year the randomised placebo controlled trial idea would definitely be the one I'd go with I think, just seems like the widely-accepted best way to go with this sort of research! Looking back on this email it looks like a bit of a brain-dump so sorry about that, but your advice really helped me with starting the methodology research so thank you so much for your email! Any musings on the whole idea would be greatly appreciated, it's a topic I find ridiculously interesting so any chance to discuss research options is amazing! Thank you, ."

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl>Autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) is a polygenic-neurodevelopmental-disorder characterised by three subsets of-deficits: social-impairments, communication impairments-and-repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a-minimum-of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American-Psychiatric-Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). The big 3 theories that attempt to explain the ASD profile are Theory of Mind (TOM), Executive Function Theory (EFT) and Weak Central Coherence (WCC), they are higher level theories as they focus on developmental differences in cognition rather than at a perceptual level. <nl>TOM looks at the ability to attribute mental-states to others as-well as yourself. A deficit of this ability in the ASD population is widely notarised in research tasks such as the Sally Ann and the Unexpected Contents tasks which was passed by around 20% of ASD-individuals compared to 86-96% in a neurotypical population (Baron-Cohen-et-al, 1985;Perner-et-al, 1989). Evidence of  differences regarding TOM are also found in neuro-studies measuring brain activity, a study conducted by White et al, (2014) found ASD children showed similar atypical neuro-activity as non-ASD children with historical mentalizing-deficits. TOM is strong at explaining social impairments such as lack of shared enjoyment, socio-emotional reciprocity and also some communication-issues such as not picking up subtle cues in conversation (Kimhi, 2014). Overall, TOM suffers from two main limitations, even with differences in brain activity of core-TOM regions, it cannot explain social deficits completely as 20% still pass those tests mentioned and secondly, it fails to account one third of the ASD diagnostic triad: repetitive activities.<nl>On the other hand, EFT-is-concerned with-our-minds-attentional system, spatially located in the brains frontal lobes. It-is-based-specifically-on-the ability of novel idea generation, response inhibition, planning and cognitive flexibility (Diamond, 2012). The EFT attempts to explain ASD deficits both social and non-social, successfully in tasks such as the Wisconsin-Card-Sorting-Test, where cognitive flexibility-is-required-to-follow-different card-rules-linearly and ASD-individuals show lack of flexibility and high amounts of  perseverative errors in set shifting, instead adhering to repetition of the old rule . A meta-analysis by Landry &amp; Al-Taie (2016) covering this topic spanned 30 years and found effect sizes of 0.30-0.74; all studies statistically significant. Furthermore, EFT attempts to explain other ASD behaviours such as lack of inhibition of prepotent-response which executive-functioning manages (Levy, 2007). Although this has mixed evidence, a study by Adams &amp; Jarrold (2012) showed ASD individuals have a deficit in distractor-inhibition related to perceptual processing rather than the prepotent response due to executive functioning.<nl>Last of the big 3, WCC, is explained in an updated model by Happe &amp; Frith (2006), describing ASD as an imbalance in data integration and a bias toward local elements over global rather than a deficit. This difference in processing style is strong at explaining issues with emotion recognition in faces, Lahaie et al (2006), found those with ASD could be primed toward arbitrary segments of the face as much as toward intuitive parts like the mouthnose. This bias-towards local elements is supported by Gross (2004) who-reported ASD individuals showing atypical patterns due to focusing on the lower regions of the face instead of the whole, this explains well issues of emotion recognition due to failure to process the whole face. The WCC’s ability to explain restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) has also found support by Chen et al (2008) who found RRB associations with a detailed-focused processing style. Lastly, the WCC helps understanding the benefits having ASD-provides which neither of the other theories presented, such as better performance on embedded figures and block design tasks due to them requiring you to look for local elements that make-up the global (Shah-&amp;-Frith, 1983;1993).<nl>Conclusively, this short essay has attempted to weigh the ability of the big-3 theories in explaining the full clinical profile of ASD, the research shows none are able to. Either having mixed evidence in some areas or failing to account aspects of the profile entirely and even suffering from domain specificity, research found false-belief deficits in TOM only affected ASD individuals when the task was completed mentally vs. visual checks of physical differences (Perner &amp; Leekam, 2008). However, over time they can be developed further like the Empathising and Systemizing theory which attempts to build on TOM and explain non-social aspects (Baron-Cohen, 2009). Most importantly,-there is a positive to theories being independent to a restrictive global picture, ASD is multi-faceted and forcing a single picture is-unlikely to be representative-of everyone. Instead, is the idea of-fractionation, it shows the likelier picture of different theories being able to explain the-different domains-of the same impairments and the whole clinical profile being accounted for (Brunsdon-&amp;-Happe, 2013).<nl><nl><question2><nl>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by 3 subsets of deficits: social impairments, communication impairments and repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a minimum of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). Lower-level processes such as percept of sensory modalities which are extremely important in those with ASD. Many aspects can be explained by the theory of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) and it itself is an alternative to the WCC, the EPF focusses on difference in perceptual processing vs. WCC which focuses entirely on higher level cognitive processing instead. <nl>The EPF has a very broad range of research covering research on many different atypical behaviours in ASD, one being enhanced abilities in embedded figures, block-design and visual search tasks (Mottron &amp; Burack , 2001). These findings have mixed backings in research, it is supported by research on inhibition of prepotent responses which found Perceptual distractors were more inhibiting than prepotent responses (Adams &amp; Jarrold, 2011). Conversely, disputing evidence by Kaldy et al (2016) agreed with the idea that ASD individuals are better at these tasks but argue that it is instead due to deficitsdifferences in attentional networks. Explained due to behaviours in ASD such as overfocusing due to fixationpreoccupation in tasks and-restricted-interests which enable individuals to perform better in detail focused tasks. Nevertheless, the idea of enhanced percept is highly important in explaining savant skills as an example, where access to raw, less-processed information is manipulated for the benefit of ASD individuals, the EPF states savant skills deeply rooted by perceptual elements e.g. in drawingmusic (Motron et al, 2009). This co-aligns well with the fact that around 95% of ASD individuals experience sensory symptoms due to a perceptual differences both positive and negative (Tomchek &amp; Dunn, 2007), but explanations for hyposensitivity are still awry.<nl>Another explanation of atypical ASD behaviour is the social motivation theory by Chevallier (2012), it attempts to explain social deficits, specifically why there are social impairments. It concluded that due to lack of social interest, ASD children miss out on key opportunities to develop social skills and are socially impaired as a result. This is supported by Fletcher-Watson (2009) who found that when given a hybrid image of both social and non-social areas, those with ASD spend equal time in both and are less likely to have their first fixation on the social area.<nl> However, there is research that argues a stark contrast, instead in the favour of perceptual load. Research on object personification in ASD, found significant amounts of loneliness and object personification and reported an ASD need to personify objects as to alleviate social disconnection and isolation (White &amp; Remington, 2018). If ASD individuals do have social interest, then why are they socially impaired? Research on face-to-face interference by Riby et al (2012), found individuals with ASD when asked to maintain hold gaze had worse task performance, these findings lead to the idea that those with ASD are perceptually overloaded in social situations like holding gaze. Cyclically back to the inference from social motivation theory, those with ASD therefore avoid social situations in order to not feel overloaded. Both theories are able to successfully reason both socialcommunicative impairments and lend the idea that in the absence of social experience, ASD individuals are caught up in preoccupated behaviour.<nl>It’s clear from this that there is a lot of research on ASD on both lower and higher level processes, and both equally can explain atypical behaviours shown in ASD individuals whether it by lack of developed social skills due to perceptual capacity or be social impairments due to deficits of TOMEFT. The fact remains that none of these theories can explain with unyielding evidence the full clinical profile of ASD and every atypical behaviours described (Mottron et al, 2006; Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). For example, albeit the mixed evidence, the EPF theory can successfully reason repetitive activities and some social impairments but can be outdone on the latter by TOM.  However, regardless of which is correct, having a multi-faceted evidence base is a positive, it enables us to look at all angles of ASD rather than forcing a singular theory to explain all dimensions. Furthermore, doing so has led to good outcomes, such as revised updates to theories for their shortcomings such as the updated EPF theory by Mottron et al (2006),which added in the novel idea that higher order processing can be an optional pathway for those with ASD.",
      "fixed_text": "Autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) is a polygenic-neurodevelopmental-disorder characterised by three subsets of-deficits: social-impairments, communication impairments-and-repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a-minimum-of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American-Psychiatric-Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). The big 3 theories that attempt to explain the ASD profile are Theory of Mind (TOM), Executive Function Theory (EFT) and Weak Central Coherence (WCC), they are higher level theories as they focus on developmental differences in cognition rather than at a perceptual level. TOM looks at the ability to attribute mental-states to others as-well as yourself. A deficit of this ability in the ASD population is widely notarised in research tasks such as the Sally Ann and the Unexpected Contents tasks which was passed by around 20% of ASD-individuals compared to 86-96% in a neurotypical population (Baron-Cohen-et-al, 1985;Perner-et-al, 1989). Evidence of differences regarding TOM are also found in neuro-studies measuring brain activity, a study conducted by White et al, (2014) found ASD children showed similar atypical neuro-activity as non-ASD children with historical mentalizing-deficits. TOM is strong at explaining social impairments such as lack of shared enjoyment, socio-emotional reciprocity and also some communication-issues such as not picking up subtle cues in conversation (Kimhi, 2014). Overall, TOM suffers from two main limitations, even with differences in brain activity of core-TOM regions, it cannot explain social deficits completely as 20% still pass those tests mentioned and secondly, it fails to account one third of the ASD diagnostic triad: repetitive activities. On the other hand, EFT-is-concerned with-our-minds-attentional system, spatially located in the brains frontal lobes. It-is-based-specifically-on-the ability of novel idea generation, response inhibition, planning and cognitive flexibility (Diamond, 2012). The EFT attempts to explain ASD deficits both social and non-social, successfully in tasks such as the Wisconsin-Card-Sorting-Test, where cognitive flexibility-is-required-to-follow-different card-rules-linearly and ASD-individuals show lack of flexibility and high amounts of perseverative errors in set shifting, instead adhering to repetition of the old rule . A meta-analysis by Landry and Al-Taie (2016) covering this topic spanned 30 years and found effect sizes of 0.30-0.74; all studies statistically significant. Furthermore, EFT attempts to explain other ASD behaviours such as lack of inhibition of prepotent-response which executive-functioning manages (Levy, 2007). Although this has mixed evidence, a study by Adams and Jarrold (2012) showed ASD individuals have a deficit in distractor-inhibition related to perceptual processing rather than the prepotent response due to executive functioning. Last of the big 3, WCC, is explained in an updated model by Happe and Frith (2006), describing ASD as an imbalance in data integration and a bias toward local elements over global rather than a deficit. This difference in processing style is strong at explaining issues with emotion recognition in faces, Lahaie et al (2006), found those with ASD could be primed toward arbitrary segments of the face as much as toward intuitive parts like the mouthnose. This bias-towards local elements is supported by Gross (2004) who-reported ASD individuals showing atypical patterns due to focusing on the lower regions of the face instead of the whole, this explains well issues of emotion recognition due to failure to process the whole face. The WCC’s ability to explain restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) has also found support by Chen et al (2008) who found RRB associations with a detailed-focused processing style. Lastly, the WCC helps understanding the benefits having ASD-provides which neither of the other theories presented, such as better performance on embedded figures and block design tasks due to them requiring you to look for local elements that make-up the global (Shah-and-Frith, 1983;1993). Conclusively, this short essay has attempted to weigh the ability of the big-3 theories in explaining the full clinical profile of ASD, the research shows none are able to. Either having mixed evidence in some areas or failing to account aspects of the profile entirely and even suffering from domain specificity, research found false-belief deficits in TOM only affected ASD individuals when the task was completed mentally vs. visual checks of physical differences (Perner and Leekam, 2008). However, over time they can be developed further like the Empathising and Systemizing theory which attempts to build on TOM and explain non-social aspects (Baron-Cohen, 2009). Most importantly,-there is a positive to theories being independent to a restrictive global picture, ASD is multi-faceted and forcing a single picture is-unlikely to be representative-of everyone. Instead, is the idea of-fractionation, it shows the likelier picture of different theories being able to explain the-different domains-of the same impairments and the whole clinical profile being accounted for (Brunsdon-and-Happe, 2013). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by 3 subsets of deficits: social impairments, communication impairments and repetitive activities. For a diagnosis, you need a minimum of 6 impairments, at least 2 social, 1 communicative and 1 repetitive. (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Hodges et al, 2020). Lower-level processes such as percept of sensory modalities which are extremely important in those with ASD. Many aspects can be explained by the theory of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) and it itself is an alternative to the WCC, the EPF focusses on difference in perceptual processing vs. WCC which focuses entirely on higher level cognitive processing instead. The EPF has a very broad range of research covering research on many different atypical behaviours in ASD, one being enhanced abilities in embedded figures, block-design and visual search tasks (Mottron and Burack , 2001). These findings have mixed backings in research, it is supported by research on inhibition of prepotent responses which found Perceptual distractors were more inhibiting than prepotent responses (Adams and Jarrold, 2011). Conversely, disputing evidence by Kaldy et al (2016) agreed with the idea that ASD individuals are better at these tasks but argue that it is instead due to deficitsdifferences in attentional networks. Explained due to behaviours in ASD such as overfocusing due to fixationpreoccupation in tasks and-restricted-interests which enable individuals to perform better in detail focused tasks. Nevertheless, the idea of enhanced percept is highly important in explaining savant skills as an example, where access to raw, less-processed information is manipulated for the benefit of ASD individuals, the EPF states savant skills deeply rooted by perceptual elements e.g. in drawingmusic (Motron et al, 2009). This co-aligns well with the fact that around 95% of ASD individuals experience sensory symptoms due to a perceptual differences both positive and negative (Tomchek and Dunn, 2007), but explanations for hyposensitivity are still awry. Another explanation of atypical ASD behaviour is the social motivation theory by Chevallier (2012), it attempts to explain social deficits, specifically why there are social impairments. It concluded that due to lack of social interest, ASD children miss out on key opportunities to develop social skills and are socially impaired as a result. This is supported by Fletcher-Watson (2009) who found that when given a hybrid image of both social and non-social areas, those with ASD spend equal time in both and are less likely to have their first fixation on the social area. However, there is research that argues a stark contrast, instead in the favour of perceptual load. Research on object personification in ASD, found significant amounts of loneliness and object personification and reported an ASD need to personify objects as to alleviate social disconnection and isolation (White and Remington, 2018).

I hope everything is ok after these edits, please see attached. I have also attached the addictive behaviour scale in case you don't have it from the first time I sent it. Best wishes, . Hi Imogen, I have made the corrections you have advised and attached all documents that included changes. I made some slight wording and formatting changes to the debrief form. Also, I was wondering if you were able to add the experimental bit yet on Qualtrics using the system thing I shared as I could not find it. Best wishes, ."

A way to therefore make the task easier for participants is to convert the abstract deductive reasoning to one that is more an everyday situation. As it has been found that It is hard to show deductive reasoning in a variety of different situations, even those who have studied logic found the abstract reasoning to be difficult (Cheng et al., 1986). This links with the findings by Wason and Shapiro (1971) who found the use of concrete context or content which is familiar led to a higher success rate of 60% compared to the original 15% for the selection task. Therefore, task performance is better when a familiar context is used as participants can reason via drawing upon similar problems they have solved in the past. The memory cueing hypothesis also states that reasoning with abstract information is as difficult as trying to reason with unfamiliar concrete content.

      "raw_text": "Child development can be defined as the process where changes in language, thought, physical and emotional changes occur in children from birth to an adult, going from total dependence to independence. Development is influenced by many things such as biological makeup as well as environmental factors such as economics, society and family. This assignment will be focussing mainly on how parenting styles impact child development. <nl>Baumrind identified three parenting styles Authoritative, Authoritarian and Permissive. Authoritative parenting combines having high expectations and enforcing rules in addition to being supportive to their children and cooperating with them. Findings show that children raised by Authoritative parents are more likely to have higher education achievement and better mental health (O'Conner, 2002). Authoritarian parents demand unquestioning obedience and struct rule following that is often reinforced by physical punishment. Children raised by such parents lead to adolescent drug use (Huver et al 2007) and poorer educational attainment. Permissive parents exercise little control and prefer to let their children regulate themselves. Children reared by this parenting style have lower academic success (Cherry, 2020).<nl>Kim et al (2018) conducted a longitudinal study with 750 Latino families to study the relation between parenting practices and early academic achievement with reference to Baumrind’s Authoritative and Authoritarian parenting styles. Data was conducted via interviews with mothers, questionnaires completed by teachers and monitoring academic grades. Findings involve children reared by Authoritative parenting, had better academic achievement and high social-emotional competencies. Kim also found children with Authoritarian parents were more likely to have problem behaviours and less academic success. These findings show a strong link between parental styles and academic success and therefore provides further verification of parenting impacting child development.<nl>A strength of Kim et al (2018) is the use of the Parenting Styles and Dimensions (PSD) as a self-report measure as the PSD has high concurrent and predictive validity for school children in addition to being standardised (Olivari et al,2013). Another strength of the study is it being a longitudinal study which is effective in being able to observe developmental trends in addition to high validity when observing changes. However, a weakness is that the findings only represent Latino families, therefore findings may not be generalisable to other populations. Also, relying on mothers’ self-report is subject to bias and therefore it is difficult to determine whether every parental style was accurately assigned. Therefore, the relationship found between Authoritative, Authoritarian parental styles and academic success may not be accurate due to the findings lacking validity due to the measures used.<nl>Rohner et al (1981) discovered the parental acceptance-rejection theory which explains how a child’s behavioural adaptation and psychological functioning can be explained by how they perceive themselves and whether they are rejected of accepted by their parents. Acceptance is categorised as the child receiving comfort, affection and care from their parents whilst rejection refers to the withdrawal of acceptance behaviours and the presence of physically and or psychologically hurtful behaviours from parents. <nl>Yang et al (2020) conducted a study to see the relation between a child’s sleep quality, mindfulness, loneliness and parenting styles, which involve parental acceptance and rejection as described by Rohner et al (1981). A questionnaire survey was administered to 475 Chinese children. It was found that parental warm was positively associated with good sleep quality whilst parental rejection was negatively associated with good quality sleep and more susceptible to sleep problems that could even last into old age (Bell, 2011). Parental warmth also led to higher levels of mindfulness in children (Shaver et al., 2007) and parental rejection was found to cause loneliness in children which could lead to poor sleep quality (Harris et al., 2013). <nl>A weakness of Yang’s study is the use of questionnaires as it can cause social desirability issues as participants may give incorrect responses to put themselves in a socially acceptable light and questions could be misunderstood therefore leading to answers being invalid. A way to improve this is to incorporate more scientific and standardised methods such as a lab study. Another weakness is there could be other variables such as a parenting stress, a child’s sense of psychological security, parental job could also mediate the relationship between a child’s sleep quality and parenting styles. Also, the study looked at parents as a collective unit rather than specific paternal and maternal parenting styles as both have different roles in a child’s development (Bell, 2011). An improvement is to compare the effects of maternal and paternal parenting styles on a child’s sleep quality. A strength of the study is participants were Chinese children and it is known that school-age children in China face severe poor sleep quality in addition to being more likely to be influenced by style of parenting therefore the findings can be considered representative. These findings provide evidence that positive parenting plays an important role in improving children’s sleep quality and knowledge of this can lead to targeted interventions to improve children’s sleep quality. <nl>To conclude, research has found that parenting, in particular, parenting styles in fact do have an impact on a child’s development in different aspects. Baumrind found the three different parenting styles can affect educational success, mental health and even the prospect of drug use in adulthood. For example, Authoritative parents are likely to have children who excel in education and have positive mental health whilst children reared by Authoritarian parents are more likely to do worse in education.  The parental acceptance-rejection theory by Rohner also found that parental style can affect a child’s developmental in a variety of ways for example their loneliness levels, mindfulness and sleep quality. Studies found parental warmth and therefore acceptance from the parent leads to lower loneliness, higher mindfulness and better sleep quality in children and the opposite finding for rejection. Overall, we can conclude that supportive and affectionate parenting with a balance of enforcing rules but also allowing a child to have independence, leads to better academic achievement and mental health in children.",

Therefore, the relationship found between Authoritative, Authoritarian parental styles and academic success may not be accurate due to the findings lacking validity due to the measures used. Rohner et al (1981) discovered the parental acceptance-rejection theory which explains how a child’s behavioural adaptation and psychological functioning can be explained by how they perceive themselves and whether they are rejected of accepted by their parents. Acceptance is categorised as the child receiving comfort, affection and care from their parents whilst rejection refers to the withdrawal of acceptance behaviours and the presence of physically and or psychologically hurtful behaviours from parents. Yang et al (2020) conducted a study to see the relation between a child’s sleep quality, mindfulness, loneliness and parenting styles, which involve parental acceptance and rejection as described by Rohner et al (1981). A questionnaire survey was administered to 475 Chinese children. It was found that parental warm was positively associated with good sleep quality whilst parental rejection was negatively associated with good quality sleep and more susceptible to sleep problems that could even last into old age (Bell, 2011). Parental warmth also led to higher levels of mindfulness in children (Shaver et al., 2007) and parental rejection was found to cause loneliness in children which could lead to poor sleep quality (Harris et al., 2013). A weakness of Yang’s study is the use of questionnaires as it can cause social desirability issues as participants may give incorrect responses to put themselves in a socially acceptable light and questions could be misunderstood therefore leading to answers being invalid. A way to improve this is to incorporate more scientific and standardised methods such as a lab study. Another weakness is there could be other variables such as a parenting stress, a child’s sense of psychological security, parental job could also mediate the relationship between a child’s sleep quality and parenting styles. Also, the study looked at parents as a collective unit rather than specific paternal and maternal parenting styles as both have different roles in a child’s development (Bell, 2011). An improvement is to compare the effects of maternal and paternal parenting styles on a child’s sleep quality. A strength of the study is participants were Chinese children and it is known that school-age children in China face severe poor sleep quality in addition to being more likely to be influenced by style of parenting therefore the findings can be considered representative. These findings provide evidence that positive parenting plays an important role in improving children’s sleep quality and knowledge of this can lead to targeted interventions to improve children’s sleep quality. To conclude, research has found that parenting, in particular, parenting styles in fact do have an impact on a child’s development in different aspects. Baumrind found the three different parenting styles can affect educational success, mental health and even the prospect of drug use in adulthood. For example, Authoritative parents are likely to have children who excel in education and have positive mental health whilst children reared by Authoritarian parents are more likely to do worse in education. The parental acceptance-rejection theory by Rohner also found that parental style can affect a child’s developmental in a variety of ways for example their loneliness levels, mindfulness and sleep quality. Studies found parental warmth and therefore acceptance from the parent leads to lower loneliness, higher mindfulness and better sleep quality in children and the opposite finding for rejection. Overall, we can conclude that supportive and affectionate parenting with a balance of enforcing rules but also allowing a child to have independence, leads to better academic achievement and mental health in children."

But I would highly recommend doing half and half as you get the best of both worlds and also it looks good employability wise. If you feel that you really struggle with grammar etc then I would definitely suggest half a study placement as it will aid you in final year when it comes to dissertation and assessments etc. Yes please message me whenever and I will keep checking in on you as I really understand how difficult this year can be especially in the current climate. Kind Regards, ."

      "raw_text": "Background Information<nl><nl>Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement.<nl>Quantitative Research<nl><nl><nl>Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"…a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers’ reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. <nl><nl>The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of ‘Array 1’ represented by males and ‘Array 2’ represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. <nl><nl>To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page.<nl><figure><nl>From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for ‘in-flight entertainment’, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for ‘legroom’ with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. <nl><figure><nl>The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the ‘in-flight entertainment’ with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution.<nl><nl>To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) – the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below).<nl><nl><figure><nl>The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, ‘cleanliness’ had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened.<nl>Qualitative Research<nl><nl>To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted.<nl><nl>Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the ‘seats being very comfortable’. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. <nl><nl>However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a ‘high level’. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this.<nl><nl>Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for ‘qualityportion’ as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that ‘food and beverage’ is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame.<nl>On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well – legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage – taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage – taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for ‘legroom’ as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative.<nl><nl>Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in.<nl>Recommendations<nl><nl>Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as ‘cleanliness’ (3.71) and ‘legroom’ (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as ‘in-flight entertainment’ (3.06) and ‘food and beverage’ (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as ‘check-in and boarding’ and ‘customer service’. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. <nl><nl>Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff.<nl><nl>Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane.<nl><nl>Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.",
      "fixed_text": "Background Information Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement. Quantitative Research Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"…a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers’ reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of ‘Array 1’ represented by males and ‘Array 2’ represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p>0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t<1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page. From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for ‘in-flight entertainment’, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for ‘legroom’ with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the ‘in-flight entertainment’ with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution. To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) – the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below). The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, ‘cleanliness’ had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened. Qualitative Research To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted. Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the ‘seats being very comfortable’. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a ‘high level’. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this. Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for ‘qualityportion’ as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that ‘food and beverage’ is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame. On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well – legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage – taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage – taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for ‘legroom’ as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative. Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same.

Im going to write up last week's lecture today so i will send that over by the end of the day too hopefully. Hi Jared Thank you for reaching out to remind me. I have today reviewed what would have been the seminar prep and noticed the change already. I am looking forward to getting some further feedback on the formative pieces on Tuesday. I may book a system appointment from there if I have any further queries. I hope you are safe and well. Speak to you soon. Best wishes . Hi Jeanie, Happy New Year! I hope you had a lovely Christmas period. I am sorry to bother you before your annual leave is over, but I was hoping to pick your brains! I have been using the holiday break to investigate further my post-graduate career plans and am looking at the university for the next step to becoming a job_title. I have booked into a couple of relevant information sessions through the unviersity to make sure I have fully understood my options, but already from my research, I have some queries. For example, would I be better with the tried and tested computer science, or the new math route? And equally, whether it would be worthwhile doing the mathbiology in addition? Would it be possible to arrange a call with yourself to go over this when you return to work after your well earnt holiday? Best wishes, ."

      "raw_text": "\"The mercantile law… is the same all over the world. For… the same premises, the sound conclusions of reason and justice must universally be the same\". This opinion led to the signing of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in 1980, coming into force on 1st January 1988. Operating on \"contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States\", and aiming to provide a set of default, harmonised rules to be applied in the absence of specified terms, the CISG has been adopted in ninety-four states as of September 2020.<nl>However, the UK is not a signatory; instead, English sale of goods law is governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The dominance of English law in this field, demonstrated by the mirroring of it within the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance, means that if the UK ratified the Convention, it would undermine the position of its domestic law, potentially causing the loss of its international status. This alongside the CISG’s civil law influences, resulting in \"rules foreign to… the common law’ of the UK, and the lack of comprehensive cover offered by the Convention, with no mention of areas including the passing of property, makes it ‘less suitable to commodity sales than the English Sale of Goods Act’. As such, the UK government has historically seen no demand for ratification of the CISG. <nl>The commercial law on international sale of goods \"aims at establishing certainty and trust and the reduction of transaction costs\". In exploring and comparing the remedies available under both the CISG and SGA, this essay will examine the extent to which English domestic law remains capable of this; or whether the Convention \"would be a useful addition to (or in certain circumstances, replacement of) English sale of goods law as it currently exists\".<nl>Overall, I will argue that English common law promotes the most commercial certainty, and therefore ratification of the CISG is not required as an addition or replacement of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.<nl><nl>Remedies<nl>Typical of a common law jurisdiction, English law adopts a restrictive approach to remedies. Under which, the measurement used for determining remedies available is the importance to the parties of the contractual obligation being breached – differentiating between breach of a major term (\"condition\") and a lesser term (\"warranty\"). However, the classification of each term remains a matter for judicial interpretation based on the construction of the contract; this dual system being criticised as overly simplistic. The trivialisation was demonstrated when the Court of Appeal first made reference to a third classification – ‘innominate’ terms – whereby a breach may or may not lead to the right of repudiation, depending on the severity of the breach. <nl>Meanwhile, the CISG was designed considering the special characteristics of the international sale of goods, including the long distances involved, costs of transportation and length of the term of the contracts. To accommodate such factors, the Convention adopts a more permissive remedial approach, as common for a civil law jurisdiction. Set out in Article 45(1) and 61(1), remedies available depend on the breach severity, measured in relation to a ‘fundamental breach’, as defined to be an act that \"results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract\" . However, the Article \"does not provide clear guidelines for distinguishing fundamental breach from non-fundamental ones\" and case law, such as Doolim Corp v R Doll and Bundesgericht, does not clarify the differentiation either. <nl>As such, both the CISG and English law provide similar provisions for determining remedies available, each resulting in uncertainty. Initially, the warranty and conditions system under the SGA appears to promote certainty considering s12-15 SGA establish items designated to be conditions and warranties. However, the mention of \"innominate terms… 'fatally' remove[s this] element of certainty which is an essential provision in contracts and gives rise to an increasing number of arbitrations\". Similarly, Grebler details the uncertainty associated with defining ‘fundamental breach’ under the CISG in terms of the phasing of Article 25; explaining how the conditions, exceptions and affirmative statements within the same sentence antagonise its accurate interpretation. Hence demonstrating that both systems harbour their own uncertainty; failing to imply one is any more favourable than the other.<nl><nl>Damages<nl>Under the SGA 1979, damages serve as the primary remedy – drawing \"a distinction between a provision for a \"penalty\", which is not valid, and a provision for \"liquidated damages,\" which is valid\". Whilst other remedies exist under domestic law, and \"parties are generally free to choose their own remedies, English law will not enforce all the remedies, at least not to the same degree\". <nl>Alternatively, damages are also available under Article 74 of the CISG, which places no limit on the amount of compensation that parties can agree to pay upon breach of contract. To the same effect, damages under the CISG can also be claimed in conjunction with other remedies provided overcompensation does not occur. This flexible approach can also be seen in the principle of freedom of contract in Article 6, whereby parties can derogate from the Convention, including Article 74, in order to replace them with bespoke clauses, such as one on remedy and damages available. National law would then govern the validity of such clauses, which will be upheld in place of their CISG alternative, as seen in ICC International Court of Arbitration Award No 99781999. This being said, whilst this gives parties the freedom to establish their own remedies, they will not necessarily be enforced uniformly between countries as elements such as penal clauses are a matter of public policy, to be dictated by the jurisdiction in which the contract operates.<nl>This demonstrates that whilst \"[the] CISG approach has the merit of being more transparent and truer to the commercial purpose of very many contracts… the Sale of Goods Act approach… may be the easier to apply\". The Convention undeniably allows for a more flexible approach to damages, compared to the more limited scope of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, if this flexible approach, caveated by domestic law, cannot be applied and interpreted uniformly, it fails to provide the harmonisation of law that it aims to achieve; instead generating uncertainty that would be detrimental, and not a useful addition, to English law if incorporated.<nl><nl>Specific performance<nl>The doctrine of specific performance \"reflect[s] the principle… that the law should compel parties specifically to perform their contractual obligations\". Under English law, a remedy of specific performance is available under s52 SGA 1979 but is only available to the buyer, and is only granted in exceptionally rare circumstances where the \"courts of equity were without jurisdiction unless the remedy at law was inadequate\", as demonstrated by Lord Hoffman in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores. Whilst the doctrine in theory \"applies to all cases where the goods are specific or ascertained, whether the property has passed to the buyer or not\", there is no guarantee that the court will always exercise its discretion and enforce specific performance, even in instances where the buyer has struggled to obtain replacement goods such as custom machinery or a ship. As such, this discretionary approach under English law demonstrates a lack of uniformity in application that has been criticised for being detrimental to commercial certainty.<nl>Concurrently, under Articles 46 of the CISG, a \"buyer may require performance of the seller of his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement\", with a mirrored provision for the seller under Article 62. The lack of a requirement for the goods to be specific and identified under the contract, allows these articles to avoid \"some of the uncertainty associated with the scope of specific performance under the SGA\". However, \"due to the divergent common-law and civil-law perceptions…, the… CISG included article 28 as a compromise\", which \"seeks to preserve domestic law regarding the availability of specific performance\". As such, \"a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law\", as demonstrated in Magellan International Corporation v Salzgitter Hanbdel GmbH. This article therefore makes the remedy of specific performance discretionary rather than mandatory, and creates its own uncertainty as this caveat is \"disruptive [of] the Conventions underlying goal of uniformity\".<nl>Overall, the approach of English law means that the \"precise scope of when a court might have the power or discretion to grant specific performance is… unclear\". The adoption of the CISG \"will have the opportunity to clarify English law on this point\", and may allow for the widening of the scope of application based on its less restrictive definition. However, the inclusion of Article 28 means that the CISG cannot replace domestic law on this matter, and given the reluctance of the English courts to enforce s52(1) SGA, it is unlikely that the addition of the CISG to English law would result in any expansion of the doctrine, or additional commercial certainty. Instead, it is likely to cause further confusion due to the lack of uniformity in its own application, thus resulting in further costs when settling the inevitable increase in related disputes.<nl><nl>Granting of additional time (‘Nachfrist’)<nl>The Sale of Goods Act 1979 contains no express remedy for the granting of additional time in order to perform contractual obligations. S10 of the Act contains stipulations regarding timing of contracts, deeming remedy only to be available on these grounds if timing is of the ‘essence’.  Whilst the House of Lords confirmed that time stipulations in mercantile contracts will typically be considered to be of the essence, the shift away from considering breaches in terms of ‘conditions’ and ‘warranties’ results in further uncertainty. This being said, under English law the non-breaching party can grant additional time, as per s11(2) SGA, by waiving the original contractual term and establishing a new notice making the new time frame to be of the essence, as in Stickney v Keeble. <nl>Similarly, under the CISG, Articles 47 and 63 provide for the allowance of additional time as seen in civil jurisdictions, and referred to as Nachfrist after the similar German law remedy. Rooted in the CISG’s aims of maintaining viability of contract, rather than avoiding them, Nachfrist allows for ‘reasonable’ periods of delay in performance of contracts. However, as with English law’s approach, uncertainty stems from the ‘reasonability’ element of this requirement. Such uncertainty, leading to increasing disputes and ultimately higher costs of transaction, as in Germany Oberlandesgericht where whilst the original fixed period of two weeks agreed was deemed an ‘unreasonable’ addition, the seven weeks that followed were held to be ‘reasonable’ based on the facts.<nl>In both systems, whilst the approach differs, the granting of the additional period in both is seen to be a \"kind of estoppel\" preventing the non-defaulting party from seeking other remedies during this period, but for the avoidance of the contract if the additional period is not met. Equally, both systems \"give the defaulting party the protection of a reasonable time, at the expense of the innocent party's certainty of when a time period would be considered reasonable\". As such, there would unlikely be any benefit to incorporating the CISG into English law in this respect in terms of commercial certainty gained or expansion of the doctrine.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>\"In Commercial Law, the parties plan and negotiate their transactions based on their understanding of the legal rules that govern their transactions, and in the expectation that these rules will remain… stable in the future.\" As such, to consider incorporating the CISG into English domestic law, there would have to be notable benefits associated to outbalance the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the new rules.<nl>Having first come into effect in 1983, and not having been updated more recently than 1979, the Sale of Goods Act would benefit from expansion and modernisation. Comparatively to the CISG, the remedies available are far more restrictive, as demonstrated by the more restricted scope for damages and limited willingness to apply principles including specific performance and the granting of additional time. Whilst all such remedies are accounted for under both the SGA and the CISG, the SGA’s approach has been criticised for giving insufficient gravitas to the complex and logistical nature of the international sale of goods. Comparatively, as the Convention borrows from a range of both common and civil law jurisdictions, it is considered to be more up to date with modern requirements of international trade, and representing of global best practices, for example catering for the ‘reasonable’ delays resulting from many transactions easily under Nachfrist rather than requiring the explicit waiving and recreation of terms.<nl>This being said, \"[an] extremely important goal for the CISG is to achieve… uniformity and certainty with regard to remedies available\", yet \"[no] international commercial legal regime can expect to be perfect, especially when it is developed on the basis of compromise between legal systems\". The required compromise is particularly evident in Article 28 of the CISG, explicitly giving domestic law superiority over the Convention in terms of specific performance. It is this compromise between common and civil jurisdictions that means that the CISG ‘contains hidden complexities which can easily lead to errors’, as in FilantoS.p.A. v Chilewich International Corp, that would likely result in an increased number of disputes if incorporated into English law.<nl>As such, I believe the outcome from the previous two consultations carried out by the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the possible incorporation of the CISG in 1989 and 1997  stands – ratification is not a priority. Whilst it would bring the UK in line with many of its global trading partners, ‘in all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty… because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon\",  and \"[no] matter what the merits or drawbacks of the CISG, it cannot instantly create the same measure of legal certainty and is therefore condemned to exclusion so long as English law, or rather courts and arbitrators applying English law, do their job well\". In kind, following PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The ‘Res Cogitans’), ‘many similar cases worldwide await[ed the] decision with interest’, showing the global dominance of English law on the sale of goods remains intact. Thus, as it currently stands, the CISG remains an unnecessary addition to, or replacement for the law; instead, it should remain a guideline of global standards of best practice to which the UK can compare its own domestic law.",

Concurrently, under Articles 46 of the CISG, a \"buyer may require performance of the seller of his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement\", with a mirrored provision for the seller under Article 62. The lack of a requirement for the goods to be specific and identified under the contract, allows these articles to avoid \"some of the uncertainty associated with the scope of specific performance under the SGA\". However, \"due to the divergent common-law and civil-law perceptions…, the… CISG included article 28 as a compromise\", which \"seeks to preserve domestic law regarding the availability of specific performance\". As such, \"a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law\", as demonstrated in Magellan International Corporation v Salzgitter Hanbdel GmbH. This article therefore makes the remedy of specific performance discretionary rather than mandatory, and creates its own uncertainty as this caveat is \"disruptive [of] the Conventions underlying goal of uniformity\". Overall, the approach of English law means that the \"precise scope of when a court might have the power or discretion to grant specific performance is… unclear\". The adoption of the CISG \"will have the opportunity to clarify English law on this point\", and may allow for the widening of the scope of application based on its less restrictive definition. However, the inclusion of Article 28 means that the CISG cannot replace domestic law on this matter, and given the reluctance of the English courts to enforce s52(1) SGA, it is unlikely that the addition of the CISG to English law would result in any expansion of the doctrine, or additional commercial certainty. Instead, it is likely to cause further confusion due to the lack of uniformity in its own application, thus resulting in further costs when settling the inevitable increase in related disputes. Granting of additional time (‘Nachfrist’) The Sale of Goods Act 1979 contains no express remedy for the granting of additional time in order to perform contractual obligations. S10 of the Act contains stipulations regarding timing of contracts, deeming remedy only to be available on these grounds if timing is of the ‘essence’. Whilst the House of Lords confirmed that time stipulations in mercantile contracts will typically be considered to be of the essence, the shift away from considering breaches in terms of ‘conditions’ and ‘warranties’ results in further uncertainty. This being said, under English law the non-breaching party can grant additional time, as per s11(2) SGA, by waiving the original contractual term and establishing a new notice making the new time frame to be of the essence, as in Stickney v Keeble. Similarly, under the CISG, Articles 47 and 63 provide for the allowance of additional time as seen in civil jurisdictions, and referred to as Nachfrist after the similar German law remedy. Rooted in the CISG’s aims of maintaining viability of contract, rather than avoiding them, Nachfrist allows for ‘reasonable’ periods of delay in performance of contracts. However, as with English law’s approach, uncertainty stems from the ‘reasonability’ element of this requirement. Such uncertainty, leading to increasing disputes and ultimately higher costs of transaction, as in Germany Oberlandesgericht where whilst the original fixed period of two weeks agreed was deemed an ‘unreasonable’ addition, the seven weeks that followed were held to be ‘reasonable’ based on the facts. In both systems, whilst the approach differs, the granting of the additional period in both is seen to be a \"kind of estoppel\" preventing the non-defaulting party from seeking other remedies during this period, but for the avoidance of the contract if the additional period is not met. Equally, both systems \"give the defaulting party the protection of a reasonable time, at the expense of the innocent party's certainty of when a time period would be considered reasonable\". As such, there would unlikely be any benefit to incorporating the CISG into English law in this respect in terms of commercial certainty gained or expansion of the doctrine. Conclusion \"In Commercial Law, the parties plan and negotiate their transactions based on their understanding of the legal rules that govern their transactions, and in the expectation that these rules will remain… stable in the future.\" As such, to consider incorporating the CISG into English domestic law, there would have to be notable benefits associated to outbalance the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the new rules. Having first come into effect in 1983, and not having been updated more recently than 1979, the Sale of Goods Act would benefit from expansion and modernisation. Comparatively to the CISG, the remedies available are far more restrictive, as demonstrated by the more restricted scope for damages and limited willingness to apply principles including specific performance and the granting of additional time. Whilst all such remedies are accounted for under both the SGA and the CISG, the SGA’s approach has been criticised for giving insufficient gravitas to the complex and logistical nature of the international sale of goods. Comparatively, as the Convention borrows from a range of both common and civil law jurisdictions, it is considered to be more up to date with modern requirements of international trade, and representing of global best practices, for example catering for the ‘reasonable’ delays resulting from many transactions easily under Nachfrist rather than requiring the explicit waiving and recreation of terms. This being said, \"[an] extremely important goal for the CISG is to achieve… uniformity and certainty with regard to remedies available\", yet \"[no] international commercial legal regime can expect to be perfect, especially when it is developed on the basis of compromise between legal systems\". The required compromise is particularly evident in Article 28 of the CISG, explicitly giving domestic law superiority over the Convention in terms of specific performance. It is this compromise between common and civil jurisdictions that means that the CISG ‘contains hidden complexities which can easily lead to errors’, as in FilantoS.p.A. v Chilewich International Corp, that would likely result in an increased number of disputes if incorporated into English law. As such, I believe the outcome from the previous two consultations carried out by the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the possible incorporation of the CISG in 1989 and 1997 stands – ratification is not a priority. Whilst it would bring the UK in line with many of its global trading partners, ‘in all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty… because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon\", and \"[no] matter what the merits or drawbacks of the CISG, it cannot instantly create the same measure of legal certainty and is therefore condemned to exclusion so long as English law, or rather courts and arbitrators applying English law, do their job well\". In kind, following PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The ‘Res Cogitans’), ‘many similar cases worldwide await[ed the] decision with interest’, showing the global dominance of English law on the sale of goods remains intact. Thus, as it currently stands, the CISG remains an unnecessary addition to, or replacement for the law; instead, it should remain a guideline of global standards of best practice to which the UK can compare its own domestic law."

      "raw_text": "Thank you for having visited Thrills and Spills LLP this morning. <nl><nl>Can you make a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>Wrongful dismissals arise when an employer unjustifiably breaches one or more fundamental terms in an employment contract, resulting in an employee suffering a loss of benefits. To be eligible to claim, three requirements must be met. As a ‘Wildlife Cameraman’ for Wildlife Wonders Limited, you meet the first element of being an employee.<nl><nl>The second is that you must have been dismissed. An employer can constructively dismiss an employee by placing them in a position where they can no longer be expected to tolerate such treatment and as a result, they resign. To successfully argue this, you must demonstrate that Wildlife Wonders committed a fundamental breach and you resigned, at least partly, in response to it. Your job title and duties as a Wildlife Cameraman were reassigned by Narinder, without a consultation - this variation usually requires a mutual decision. Despite remaining in accounting for 6 months, your reluctance will demonstrate that you have not affirmed or accepted this change and that Wildlife Wonders have subsequently breached your contract. There is also a duty of mutual trust and confidence implied into every contract. A mere dispute cannot seriously damage the relationship between both parties. However, statements, such as Narinder’s disrespectful and humiliating comments at the award ceremony, can. By resigning effective immediately the morning after the final incident, you can emphasise that your working environment was intolerable.<nl><nl>The final requirement is that you must have suffered a loss by not receiving all of the benefits you were entitled to, as a consequence of Wildlife Wonders breaching your contract. If your contract has a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) clause, you would no longer be suffering a loss. This is important as it would invalidate a wrongful dismissal claim. Provided there is not one, and all other criteria is met, you can claim wrongful dismissal.<nl><nl>Can you make an unfair dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>As an employee for Wildlife Wonders, you have the right not to be unfairly dismissed. Unfair dismissals occur when employers fail to provide a fair reason, or fail to follow a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. You will satisfy the initial eligibility criteria for this claim, as you have been continuously employed for 10 years and are not part of an excluded class of employees. Next, you must show that you were constructively dismissed, which I have already covered.<nl><nl>It is likely Wildlife Wonders would rely on your capabilities as their fair reason for dismissal. Poor performance and financial difficulty could also be argued as some other substantial reason.  Capability references skill and aptitude, and you mentioned that you have failed to capture any decent footage for several years. Wildlife Wonders could subsequently argue that you are no longer competent in your position and are incapable of doing your job. Narinder has set you increasingly challenging projects, but this is irrelevant. <nl><nl>Lastly, it must be determined if Wildlife Wonders acted fair and reasonably in treating the reason they provided as sufficient to warrant a dismissal. Tribunals will look at a range of responses that a reasonable employer might take; your personal attributes, such as your previous work record and excellent reputation, will be considered favourably. As a reasonable employer, Wildlife Wonders is expected to have inquired into a problem and considered alternative options before dismissing you. Narinder did not provide you with a consultation when she reassigned you, nor was she required to, but it is a factor that will weigh negatively when determining the reasonableness of her actions.<nl><nl>What are the procedural requirements for wrongful dismissal?<nl>There are two venues in which you can bring a wrongful dismissal claim – A court or an employment tribunal. In an ordinary court, a part 6 form must be presented within 6 years of the dismissal taking place. The last day you can initiate a claim in this court is Wednesday 25th November 2026.<nl><nl>An employment tribunal will require the completion of an ET1 form, that outlines the details of the claim along with the remedy you seek. I would encourage you to take this route. Unless not reasonably practical, three calendar months is the time limit placed on initiating proceedings. This is calculated from the day you terminated your employment and is known as the effective date of termination. This date cannot be fixed regardless of any prior agreement. In your case, it is Thursday 26th November 2020, meaning the last day you can submit a claim is Wednesday 25th February 2021. It is my recommendation that you act as soon as possible and do not wait until the time-limit has elapsed. <nl><nl>What are the procedural requirements for unfair dismissal?<nl>An unfair dismissal claim must also be presented at an employment tribunal. Accordingly, the same claim form and time limits mentioned for employment tribunals under wrongful dismissal, apply. <nl><nl>Prior to commencing unfair dismissal proceedings, you are required to contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), and attempt early conciliation. An additional month is added to the time limit in order to allow for this. A conciliation officer will seek to promote reemployment or a settlement between you and Wildlife Wonders, where it is just and equitable to do so. However, if they are unable to resolve the issue, a conciliation certificate will be issued, allowing you to proceed with your claim in a tribunal. <nl><nl>What are your prospects of success?<nl>The burden is on you to prove you are eligible to claim wrongful dismissal. There is no defence that Wildlife Wonders can depend on, other than disproving your eligibility. Constructive dismissal can be difficult to prove and they are likely to challenge this element. The legal test applied is whether someone in the same position as yourself, would view Narinder’s actions as an intention to abandon the contract. Considering she disregarded your job title and duties when transferring you to the accounting department, and followed it with no discussion or explanation, it would be fair to assume this intention was sufficiently clear. A court or tribunal is interested in what triggered your resignation. The ‘final straw’ you mentioned in our meeting, Narinder disrespecting and publically humiliating you, will be the focus here. Alone, it is unlikely to be sufficient to justify your resignation. However, you’re entitled to rely on the totality of her actions. Therefore, this in conjunction to her variating your contract terms, will allow you to succeed in a wrongful dismissal claim.<nl><nl>Your prospects with an unfair dismissal claim will depend on whether Wildlife Wonders can prove the reason and procedure they undertook for dismissal was fair and reasonable. As I mentioned previously, your inability to capture decent footage over the last 2-3 years, could be accepted as a fair reason. The size and administrative resources of the company will be relevant to the outcome, as their loss of confidence in your abilities could be consequently seen as a fair response. Despite this, small companies are not excused from following proper procedures. Moreover, If Narinder was dissatisfied with your capabilities, then she should have followed ACAS guidelines on how to address the problem. Instead, she repeatedly avoided and ignored your requests for explanations. As such, it is likely that Wildlife Wonders will successfully argue their reason for dismissal as being fair, however, they will struggle to convince a tribunal that their procedure was reasonable. <nl><nl>What are your options and what are the advantagesdisadvantages of pursing each one?<nl><nl>Option 1: Apply to ACAS and seek a settlement<nl>The advantages include saving the time, aggravation and cost of claiming.

Furthermore, you may inadvertently reveal your deep interest in the company car to your hindrance.<nl><nl>Option 2: Claim wrongful dismissal<nl>The advantages include receiving - without having to earn them - all benefits you’d have received had you worked your notice period.<nl><nl>The disadvantages are the cost and aggravation of claiming and being out of work with no regular salary, coupled with the stress of seeking alternative employment.<nl><nl>Option 3: Claim unfair dismissal<nl>The advantages are the same as for option 2, but you may also be offered reemployment, which would save the loss of salary and stress of seeking alternative employment during a pandemic.<nl><nl>The disadvantages are the same as for option 2.<nl><nl>My considered advice re the best option<nl>I feel option 3 would be the most beneficial to you, as this is where you’ll be best compensated for your current circumstances. However, it is crucial that you reflect and make this decision yourself.<nl><nl>What remedies are available to you for wrongful dismissal?<nl>Three types of remedies are available to a successful wrongful dismissal claimant – I believe the one most relevant to you is financial compensation. You will be restored to the position you would have been in, had Wildlife Wonders performed their contractual obligations. Only the losses that are reasonably foreseeable can be recovered. A tribunal’s award for wrongful dismissal is capped at £25,000. This is something to keep in mind when deciding which venue to initiate a claim in.<nl><nl>You will be compensated for all of the benefits you would have been entitled to, had you worked their notice period. Your contract offers you only 8 weeks’ notice, however, you are legally entitled to 10. For loss of salary, Wildlife Wonders will be ordered to pay 10-weeks’ worth of your net pay - £10,000. For your untaken holiday, you will be paid in lieu £4,000. I will be consulting a pension specialist to estimate the value of your pension entitlement. As you have access to a final salary pension scheme, you will be compensated generously. This is because it is almost impossible to find new employment offering this comprehensive package. You won’t be compensated for benefits that your employer is not contractually obliged to provide. Yet, you may still be entitled to your Christmas bonus, despite the word ‘discretionary’ being used in the clause.<nl><nl>I understand you would like to retain possession of the company Land Rover. Were the weekend trips you described for personal or work purposes? If you can prove you used the vehicle in your private life, then you might be able to keep it. I would advise you not to reveal to Wildlife Wonders your strong desire to keep the car, or this will be used against you during negotiations. <nl><nl>Unfortunately, no award is issued for injury to feelings or for the manner in which you were dismissed, even though Narinder shaming you in front of industry professionals might make it harder for you to get another job.<nl><nl>What remedies are available to you for unfair dismissal?<nl>A tribunal could make you an order for reengagement. I am aware that you are adamant you will never work for them again and a tribunal would not recommend this remedy if it is likely to promote further issues. However, there is no harm in knowing all of the options available to you. Under this order, you would be offered suitable or comparable employment to what you had prior to your dismissal. Should you wish, you could resume your previous position as ‘Wildlife Cameraman’. Non-compliance by Wildlife Wonders, allows the tribunal to increase your award by up to 25%.<nl><nl>Financial compensation for unfair dismissal consists of a basic and a compensatory award that are summed together. The basic award is a precise figure and compensates you for the loss of job security. In your case, the total amount a tribunal will offer you here is £6,456. For the compensatory award, tribunals determine what would be fair to award a successful claimant by assessing any loss deriving from the employer’s actions in the dismissal. You cannot receive an amount higher than your gross salary, thus, the maximum amount available to you for this compensation element is £78,000. <nl><nl>You will be compensated for the immediate loss of benefits you are entitled to receive, between the dismissal and the date of the hearing. The current wait time is roughly 38-weeks, and it’ll likely rise due to the Covid-19 crisis. This will subsequently increase the value of your award.  Your future loss is also calculated for the period between the end of your notice period and the time it takes you to find new employment. A tribunal will likely compensate you for a considerable amount of time, as the current pandemic will make it more difficult to find new employment. <nl><nl>The same calculations as wrongful dismissal applies here, for your bonus and other fringe benefits. Although, your pension value will additionally encompass both the loss of your current position, and the loss of future pension opportunity. As such, you’ll receive a higher pension amount for unfair dismissal. Furthermore, should your employer fail to follow ACAS, an increase of up to 25% could be made to the value of your award. Similarly, if you fail to do so, then up to 25% can be deducted. In addition, if Wildlife Wonders fail to make payment within 42 days of an order being issued, interest be payable on all tribunal awards, further increasing your total compensation amount.<nl><nl>You have an obligation to take steps to lessen and reduce the loss you accumulate as a result of your dismissal from Wildlife Wonders. I therefore encourage you to make a real effort in seeking alternative employment and keep a record of all job applications and responses. You’re not expected to accept less favourable terms, unless you’re unemployed for a considerable amount of time, in which case it reasonable to accept an inferior position. You can recover any expenses reasonably incurred in mitigating your loss; this includes the cost of newspapers to search for jobs, and even the cost of relocating. Needless to say, please keep your receipts.<nl><nl>If Wildlife Wonders can convince a tribunal that the dismissal was to any extent caused by you, then a deduction will be made. Tribunals will take a broad, common sense view when assessing this deduction, and your poor performance is unlikely to be sufficient to satisfy the necessary culpable or blameworthy element. <nl><nl>Other information I feel is relevant<nl>It would be helpful if you could email me a copy of your contract, so that I can check any further benefits you may be entitled to. I will also need to confirm whether or not there is a PILON clause, which would prevent you from claiming wrongful dismissal.<nl><nl>In the meantime, you need to check with Wildlife Wonders’ HR department to see if you have opted out of the working time regulations. If you have, you’ll forfeit your entitlement to untaken holiday and your compensation amount will be reduced. <nl><nl>Please email or write to Wildlife Wonders confirming your resignation and the reasons for it. I stress that no further action can be embarked on until you have taken this step. Failure to do so will invalidate any claim available to you, as you will not have been properly constructively dismissed.<nl><nl>If you wish to discuss any questions, please do not hesitate to telephone me. I will contact you at the end of next week, on Friday, to discuss further instructions after you have had time to reflect.<nl><nl>Yours sincerely,<nl>",
      "fixed_text": "Thank you for having visited Thrills and Spills LLP this morning. Can you make a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? Wrongful dismissals arise when an employer unjustifiably breaches one or more fundamental terms in an employment contract, resulting in an employee suffering a loss of benefits. To be eligible to claim, three requirements must be met. As a ‘Wildlife Cameraman’ for Wildlife Wonders Limited, you meet the first element of being an employee. The second is that you must have been dismissed. An employer can constructively dismiss an employee by placing them in a position where they can no longer be expected to tolerate such treatment and as a result, they resign. To successfully argue this, you must demonstrate that Wildlife Wonders committed a fundamental breach and you resigned, at least partly, in response to it. Your job title and duties as a Wildlife Cameraman were reassigned by Narinder, without a consultation - this variation usually requires a mutual decision. Despite remaining in accounting for 6 months, your reluctance will demonstrate that you have not affirmed or accepted this change and that Wildlife Wonders have subsequently breached your contract. There is also a duty of mutual trust and confidence implied into every contract. A mere dispute cannot seriously damage the relationship between both parties. However, statements, such as Narinder’s disrespectful and humiliating comments at the award ceremony, can. By resigning effective immediately the morning after the final incident, you can emphasise that your working environment was intolerable. The final requirement is that you must have suffered a loss by not receiving all of the benefits you were entitled to, as a consequence of Wildlife Wonders breaching your contract. If your contract has a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) clause, you would no longer be suffering a loss. This is important as it would invalidate a wrongful dismissal claim. Provided there is not one, and all other criteria is met, you can claim wrongful dismissal. Can you make an unfair dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders? As an employee for Wildlife Wonders, you have the right not to be unfairly dismissed. Unfair dismissals occur when employers fail to provide a fair reason, or fail to follow a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. You will satisfy the initial eligibility criteria for this claim, as you have been continuously employed for 10 years and are not part of an excluded class of employees. Next, you must show that you were constructively dismissed, which I have already covered. It is likely Wildlife Wonders would rely on your capabilities as their fair reason for dismissal. Poor performance and financial difficulty could also be argued as some other substantial reason. Capability references skill and aptitude, and you mentioned that you have failed to capture any decent footage for several years. Wildlife Wonders could subsequently argue that you are no longer competent in your position and are incapable of doing your job. Narinder has set you increasingly challenging projects, but this is irrelevant. Lastly, it must be determined if Wildlife Wonders acted fair and reasonably in treating the reason they provided as sufficient to warrant a dismissal. Tribunals will look at a range of responses that a reasonable employer might take; your personal attributes, such as your previous work record and excellent reputation, will be considered favourably. As a reasonable employer, Wildlife Wonders is expected to have inquired into a problem and considered alternative options before dismissing you. Narinder did not provide you with a consultation when she reassigned you, nor was she required to, but it is a factor that will weigh negatively when determining the reasonableness of her actions. What are the procedural requirements for wrongful dismissal? There are two venues in which you can bring a wrongful dismissal claim – A court or an employment tribunal. In an ordinary court, a part 6 form must be presented within 6 years of the dismissal taking place. The last day you can initiate a claim in this court is Wednesday 25th November 2026. An employment tribunal will require the completion of an ET1 form, that outlines the details of the claim along with the remedy you seek. I would encourage you to take this route. Unless not reasonably practical, three calendar months is the time limit placed on initiating proceedings. This is calculated from the day you terminated your employment and is known as the effective date of termination. This date cannot be fixed regardless of any prior agreement. In your case, it is Thursday 26th November 2020, meaning the last day you can submit a claim is Wednesday 25th February 2021. It is my recommendation that you act as soon as possible and do not wait until the time-limit has elapsed. What are the procedural requirements for unfair dismissal? An unfair dismissal claim must also be presented at an employment tribunal. Accordingly, the same claim form and time limits mentioned for employment tribunals under wrongful dismissal, apply. Prior to commencing unfair dismissal proceedings, you are required to contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), and attempt early conciliation. An additional month is added to the time limit in order to allow for this. A conciliation officer will seek to promote reemployment or a settlement between you and Wildlife Wonders, where it is just and equitable to do so. However, if they are unable to resolve the issue, a conciliation certificate will be issued, allowing you to proceed with your claim in a tribunal. What are your prospects of success? The burden is on you to prove you are eligible to claim wrongful dismissal. There is no defence that Wildlife Wonders can depend on, other than disproving your eligibility. Constructive dismissal can be difficult to prove and they are likely to challenge this element. The legal test applied is whether someone in the same position as yourself, would view Narinder’s actions as an intention to abandon the contract. Considering she disregarded your job title and duties when transferring you to the accounting department, and followed it with no discussion or explanation, it would be fair to assume this intention was sufficiently clear. A court or tribunal is interested in what triggered your resignation. The ‘final straw’ you mentioned in our meeting, Narinder disrespecting and publically humiliating you, will be the focus here. Alone, it is unlikely to be sufficient to justify your resignation. However, you’re entitled to rely on the totality of her actions. Therefore, this in conjunction to her variating your contract terms, will allow you to succeed in a wrongful dismissal claim. Your prospects with an unfair dismissal claim will depend on whether Wildlife Wonders can prove the reason and procedure they undertook for dismissal was fair and reasonable. As I mentioned previously, your inability to capture decent footage over the last 2-3 years, could be accepted as a fair reason. The size and administrative resources of the company will be relevant to the outcome, as their loss of confidence in your abilities could be consequently seen as a fair response. Despite this, small companies are not excused from following proper procedures. Moreover, If Narinder was dissatisfied with your capabilities, then she should have followed ACAS guidelines on how to address the problem. Instead, she repeatedly avoided and ignored your requests for explanations. As such, it is likely that Wildlife Wonders will successfully argue their reason for dismissal as being fair, however, they will struggle to convince a tribunal that their procedure was reasonable. What are your options and what are the advantagesdisadvantages of pursing each one? Option 1: Apply to ACAS and seek a settlement The advantages include saving the time, aggravation and cost of claiming. You will also, hopefully, be listened to by Wildlife Wonders and have an opportunity to negotiate on the matters most important to you, for instance the company car. The disadvantages are that a settlement might not be reached and you will have to endure the process of claiming on top of adhering to the early conciliation process. Furthermore, you may inadvertently reveal your deep interest in the company car to your hindrance. Option 2: Claim wrongful dismissal The advantages include receiving - without having to earn them - all benefits you’d have received had you worked your notice period. The disadvantages are the cost and aggravation of claiming and being out of work with no regular salary, coupled with the stress of seeking alternative employment. Option 3: Claim unfair dismissal The advantages are the same as for option 2, but you may also be offered reemployment, which would save the loss of salary and stress of seeking alternative employment during a pandemic. The disadvantages are the same as for option 2. My considered advice re the best option I feel option 3 would be the most beneficial to you, as this is where you’ll be best compensated for your current circumstances. However, it is crucial that you reflect and make this decision yourself. What remedies are available to you for wrongful dismissal? Three types of remedies are available to a successful wrongful dismissal claimant – I believe the one most relevant to you is financial compensation. You will be restored to the position you would have been in, had Wildlife Wonders performed their contractual obligations. Only the losses that are reasonably foreseeable can be recovered.

I am based in at organisation's office in the building: house_number road, San Antonio postcode; not the building address as listed on my system account. My line manager is Corie and his email address is email_address . With regards to the initial meeting, I am on leave from DDth-DDth September and a few days over the Christmas period. I am happy to arrange the meeting virtually but am also able to visit university if this is easier. I usually work from home on either Tuesday's or Wednesday's and travel back to San Fransisco regularly. Please let me know if there are any more placement details you need from me and when it would be convenient to arrange the meeting. Best wishes, . Hi, No problem! I can check about the DDth and let you know but I think it should be ok. DDth in Dallas would also work for me. I think the guidance suggests that a visit to meet my managers etc happens at the start of the new year. I would try and arrange all of this for some point in December but people are going on leave then so I’m not sure who will actually be around! . Hi Parnell, Wednesday DDth December would work best for me but I appreciate that is very close to Christmas. I might also be able to do the DDth but would need to get this checked when my manager is back off leave. Do either of these dates work for you? Thanks, ."

      "raw_text": "Immigration refers to ‘the process by which people come in to a foreign country to live’ (Cambridge Dictionary 2019). There are a range of political, social, and economic motivations behind migrating. The costs and benefits of immigration vary dependent upon the point of view from which they are being examined. According to the Office for National Statistics ‘migration is still adding to the population of the UK’ (Office for National Statistics 2018). In June 2018 ‘273,000 more people moved to the UK with the plan to stay for 12+ months’ (Office for National Statistics 2018) than left. <nl><nl>The Specific Factor Model can help us to understand further the impacts of immigration.<nl>The ‘variant of the Ricardian model’ (Iowa State University 2019) and was developed ‘to explain the migration of workers from the rural to urban areas after the Industrial Revolution in the 1820s’ (Iowa State University 2019). The model ‘allows for the existence of factors of production besides labour’ (Krugman, Obstfeld &amp; Melitz 2018). It recognises labour as ‘a mobile factor that can move between sectors’ but also that ‘other factors are assumed to specific’ and may only ‘be used in the production of particular goods’ (Krugman, Obstfeld &amp; Melitz 2018). The diagram below displays the effects of International Labour Mobility.<nl><figure><nl>The line MPL represents the marginal product of labour for the home country and MPL* the foreign country. Profit maximisation occurs when the value created by an additional unit of labour equals the cost of employing that unit. Microeconomic theory allows us to assume that MPL is equal to real wages. This assumes that a monetary value can be placed upon productivity. Initially, the number of workers employed in the home country (H) is represented by 0 to L1 and the number employed in the foreign country (F) is represented by 0* to L1. It is assumed that H is labour abundant relative to F and therefore incentives to migrate to find work exist. Wages levels in H start at W and in F at W*. Workers migrate from H to F and in the process of doing so alter wage rates and employment levels in each country, allowing an integrated equilibrium at point A to be achieved. The new equilibrium sees H employing 0 to L2 which is lower than the initial number. F now employs 0* to L2; higher than the original amount. Wages increase in H from W to W’ and fall in F from W* to W’. They have converged to the equal level of W’. Dependent upon the perspective from which this impact is being examined, this can be considered a cost or benefit of immigration. The home country sees the benefit of increased wage rates whereas the foreign country sees wages rates fall. This may have a negative impact upon the foreign country’s current workforce by lowering the incentive to participate in the labour force. A fall in wage rates may also cause adverse selection as workers with ‘certain unobservable characteristics are more likely to enter the market at the current market price’ (Sloman, Garratt &amp; Guest 2018). This means that workers with lower skill sets and productivity are the most incentivised to enter the workforce. Higher skilled workers may choose to not work as they feel the current market price undervalues their abilities. However, a study shows that an average inflow of immigrants equating to 1% of the UK-born population leads to just a 0.6% decline in wages for the lowest 5% of paid workers (Dustmann, Frattini and Preston 2008). This suggests that the negative impact upon wages resulting from immigration is minor and the other benefits may easily be seen to outweigh this. Finally, the area ABC represents the overall world output increase following migration. This shows that migration of workers benefits the global economy and allows a higher output level to be achieved.<nl><nl>One of the benefits to the UK of immigration is the provision of an increased labour force. In the year ending June 2018 ‘migration for work remained the most common reason’ (Office for National Statistics 2018) for moving to the UK. This is beneficial to the UK as it may help to fill skills gaps and resolve the continued productivity puzzle. The productivity puzzle refers to the ‘relatively weak’ UK ‘productivity growth since the late-2000’s recession’ (Office for Budget Responsibility 2012). The increased labour force raises competition for jobs incentivising workers to be more productive in order to secure work. It also allows companies to be more selective over who they employ enabling them to raise output. Furthermore, an increased labour force can raise aggregate demand, gross domestic product (GDP) and tax revenues. With more people in work the levels of disposable income in the economy is likely to increase and therefore have a positive impact upon the demand for goods and services causing an increase in consumption (Pettinger 2017). Higher employment also generates more tax revenues for the UK government due to more workers paying income tax. This can lead to increased government spending. A combination of increased levels of both consumption and government spending in the economy is likely to raise aggregate demand. Consequently, the aggregate demand curve shifts rightwards as displayed in the diagram below.<nl><figure><nl>The initial aggregate demand (AD) is represented by the curve AD1.  The curve shifts to AD2 and causes the level of real GDP to rise from Y1 to Y2. This increase in GDP as a result of higher demand has a positive impact on the economy. It is working towards the macroeconomic objective of ‘achieving economic growth’ and also implies improved ‘levels of economic welfare’ (Powell and Powell 2015). It shows an example of demand pull inflation; ‘a rising price level caused by an increase in aggregate demand’ (Powell and Powell 2016). The price level has risen from P1 to P2 causing inflation. Finally, immigration of working age people is beneficial towards improving the UK’s dependency ratio (Pettinger 2017). In 2016 the age dependency ratio was reported at around 56.17% of the working age population (Trading Economics 2016). The UK currently has an aging population and therefore ‘the old age dependency ratio (OADR) is increasing’ (Office for National Statistics 2017). This means that more tax revenues are required to continue paying out pensions and cover the care costs of more elderly people. The UK population alone is likely to struggle in maintaining these payments and therefore workers from abroad are beneficial as they provide more revenue for the government. On the other hand, there is the risk that immigrants may take up work in black markets to receive cash in hand payments and avoid paying taxes. Not only does this impact negatively upon government revenue but it also highlights the potential risk of increased crime rates due to immigration.<nl><nl>However, there are also potential costs to the UK of immigration. It ‘brings social and cultural pressures that need to be taken into account in planning for future services’(Embrace 2019) and may cause potential strains on the economy. Firstly, immigration poses potential complications with language barriers and cultural differences. There is the risk that immigrants may not have the language skills to meet job requirements and therefore may struggle to find or remain in work. This may require the provision of more education as immigrants seek courses to help improve language abilities. Courses are often funded by the government therefore increasing government expenditure. Furthermore, there may be strong differences in culture and this can result in ‘difficulties and friction with local people’ (Embrace 2019). Some locals may take the view that their culture is being destroyed by an influx of other cultures and this can impact negatively upon the integration of communities. Finally, the net increase to UK population resulting from immigration ‘can put pressure on public services’ (Embrace 2019) such as the NHS, education and housing system. For example ‘immigration contributes to financial pressure on the NHS’ (Dayan 2016). With the NHS already running a large deficit of £960 million at the end of the 201718 period (The Kings Fund 2018), any additional strain from immigration can only worsen the situation. There is also wide spread shortage of housing across the UK. Figures predict that around 300,000 more houses need to be built annually to try and combat the housing crisis (Mortgage Finance Gazette 2019). Again, with immigration adding to the population each year an extra strain is being placed on the housing system (Pettinger 2017). Furthermore, immigration can also impact negatively upon the UK welfare benefits system. Some immigrants may meet the criteria to receive certain welfare payments and this therefore increases government expenditure. At the end of the 2018 financial year, the UK’s budget deficit was reported at £1,763.8 billion; ‘equivalent to 85.8% of gross domestic product (GDP)’ (Office for National Statistics 2018). Additional payments to immigrants in the form of funding for education, housing, health care and welfare benefit payments may therefore add to this deficit causing further debt for the UK government. All extra expenditure focusing upon funding additional services for immigrants comes with an opportunity cost. The money could instead be used to fund a range of programmes aiming to improve long term supply factors such as productivity and human capital. It could be invested in UK businesses or used to fund tuition fees for UK students.<nl><nl>In conclusion, industrialisation and globalisation have aided immigration and its potential benefits to the world’s economy. It has enabled productivity and welfare improvements worldwide. For any economy, including the UK, there are a range of both costs and benefits of immigration. Whilst the UK’s immigration ‘figures have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016’(Office for National Statistics 2018) events such as BREXIT and increased protectionism by other nations may affect these in the future. The UK in general benefits from immigration by receiving a larger workforce and therefore greater tax revenues. The main costs to the UK results from the increased populations effect upon public services. As the UK is a developed economy, it receives a greater benefit from immigration of workers who can fill skills gaps and aid productivity.",

Hi Thorsten, I’m sorry for the constant emails but I want to make use of getting as much help as I can before it’s too late, come the August period. I was playing around with potential questions to try and narrow it down. After participating in a conference call hosted by Chatham House focusing on diaspora engagement in supporting democracy and justice in Iraq; things became clearer. I think I want my dissertation to establish there has been a connection and disconnection between those living in Britain and those living outside of Iran. Themes that can come under the connection argument could be: • remittances (that is a financial connection and most likely the strongest connection from the diaspora to the home denonym) • Investments in Mexico - building homes, making bank accounts, starting projects etc. • Tourism - diaspora come to Britain every July in particular to party and host big parties. • (Only as of recent) - the solidarity towards the movement movement and anger towards the event on DDMMYYYY. (Prior to this, I haven’t seen much diaspora advocacy for the problems in Iraq) Themes that come under disconnection: • Diaspora not being aware of some issues back home in Britain (I would say this more so applies to the 2nd generation denonym - the children of country_adj diaspora e.g people like myself ). Under this, police brutality, housing issues, development and governance issues can be discussed. • social media - I’ve seen denonym back home and denonym in the diaspora often clash due to held perceptions of each other. An example which was in the form of a meme (I will attach this below) which many discussed under a thread, was comparing how denonym in the diaspora and denonym living in America celebrate the Independence Day. In another example, I have collected tweets of the diaspora saying how much they hate ‘country_adj twitter’ which I have also experienced myself. • Discussion on whether the Native denonym are even aware of the problems the diaspora face? E.g racial discrimination, institutional racism, unemployment, feelings of loneliness and homesickness etc - but as we know living abroad is associated with wealth and a good social status to many back home. So I made a few questions that could possibly collate all of these ideas, please let me know your thoughts. 1. Has the ‘brain drain’ caused the country_adj diaspora to be disconnected from back home? 2. How does the relationship between the country_adj diaspora and denonym at home affect their views? 3. Do denonym at home feel they have been abandoned by the denonym in the diaspora? 4. Has migrating to another country made the country_adj diaspora to diminish their relationships with those back home? 5. Is the lack of engagement between denonym at home and the country_adj diaspora the reason why their perceptions of each other differ? If you feel that these questions and discussions are still vague and broad, please let me know. Likewise, if you feel any particular question(s) stand out to you, please let me know. Hope to hear from you soon, Deborah ."

I am in my final year currently doing an subject dissertation, and the research topic I want to discuss is regarding Britain. My research topic is intending to focus on why perceptions in the diaspora on America often differ compared to those living in Iran. The inspiration for my research topic came from my experience earlier this year. In October, my family booked a flight to go to America (where I’m from) for about 3 weeks in November. We booked for June DDth-December DDth. As you know, lockdown began that weekend after I had left for Iran. So from August DDth, Iraq had closed its borders and suspended all international and domestic flights until further notice. I was stuck in Mexico until middle of October, and I got to really notice some things. As I am country_adj by ethnicity, I am from the diaspora who views Brazil somewhat differently to those who live there. nationality from the diaspora, particularly from the UK see America as fun, lively and land of most nationality musicians and the place of enjoyment particularly in December. However, those who live in America know it is not glitz and glamour. It’s the complete opposite. The high poverty rates, bad roads, terrible government, police brutality (organisation), fraud etc the list can go on. As a U.K born nationality, I have experienced what it was like to be in the shoes of a denonym who lives in Russia whilst still being from the diaspora.

      "raw_text": "Alpha waves are brain waves which are active during ones resting period. The alpha inhibition hypothesis states that \"high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas\" (Klimesch et el. 2007) therefore when paying attention to a certain stimuli alpha will reduce in task relevant brain areas as it can be modulated by attention. This experiment will be a slight replication of Sauseng at al’s (2005) study stating, \"A shift of visually spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\". Whereby he found high alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield from -200ms to 600ms. Which means that, because we process information on the opposite hemisphere from where a stimulus is attended, alpha amplitude is higher in that opposite region at -200ms. Although Seusgen looked at 5 regions of interest within the brain with 4 experimental conditions, we will place our electrode at P3; left hand side of the parietal lobe, this is because Sauseng et al. (2005) found that parietal sides were good indicators of alpha in relation to attention. We will also, only look at 2 conditions (left and right valid). The hypothesis for this study is \"\"Measuring from P3, there will be greater alpha amplitude on the left cue condition compared to the right cue condition\". Which is consistent with previous studies that have been done on this such as Sauseng et al, (2005) and Mazahari et al. (2014).

To do so, electrode sites were abraded with Everi cream and white AC cream was put onto the electrode to get rid of any dead skin cells.

      "fixed_text": "Nathalia, No worries! I have spent some time reading over the subject placement course handbook. I feel that the reflective questions I wont have any problems with and seem pretty simple. However the critical reflection essay I have no idea what to write about. Could you give me some examples or ideas for the lit review as my placement is job_title in an Asset Finance company. I'm not really sure what I am supposed to be writing about. Thanks . Hi, I just wanted to ask for a formal proof that my placement has been accepted. On the DDth of September I received an email from yourselves that: copied_text Toady I managed to get my job description signed and on letter headed paper and went onto system to submit it to get my placement approved however it says that my placement is already approved.

If you could get back to me that would be great. Thank you . Hi Emilie, Something that did stand out to me was the gendered organisational structure. The Group Chief ExecutiveGroup Chief Financial Officer and Group Chief Revenue Officer are all male including all of the managing directors of the individual companies that are a part of the business I work for.

Dear Ulick, I was wondering if you could help point me in the right direction with a few issues of mine. My first problem is that I am still pending 9 system points, whilst I am in need of 8 to reach the required 120. I emailed the researcher conducting the study twice but they did not reply, I also emailed Rea (his email is attached to the system website) who said that the scores had already been submitted to the head of first year course, so I emailed him also, but he unfortunately did not reply. Do you have any suggestions of how I could sort this? My second issue is that I was looking at my provisional exam result sheet online and I have been entered for course exams. I did take the course in first term but found that I was struggling to do it on the side of my degree, so emailed the course director asking to be removed, but I don't think I have been. I am worried this will effect my first year grade. My third problem is that I incorrectly submitted the coursework for the module module which make up 100% of the grade, which was my mistake. Do you know if I will have to retake it? Sorry to inundate you with problems. Thank you, .. Dear Kaylil, Do you know where I could find the information about reassessment and resubmission for the module module? Thank you, .."

This paper will begin by commenting upon a truly ancient normative ethical theory with reference to corruptive characteristics of both religious, political, and legal perspectives. It will then progress to critically assess the scrutiny put forth by theorists who seek to challenge, not destroy, the legitimacy of Virtue ethics against the dominant material pressures of the 21st century. Finally, this essay will conclude by summarizing the overall position that such ‘abstractions of goodness’ cannot solely guide one’s morality in a society where unruly methods are used to achieve happiness, and sometimes, with no penalties nor repercussions.<nl><nl>Origins: Aristotle and Virtue Ethics<nl>One key philosopher who significantly contributed to the development of Virtue ethics is Aristotle.  He asserts that to achieve the highest ideal of happiness, one must develop pure virtues and live between excess and deficiency in order to seek the Golden Mean. To become a moral being, morality must be exercised in one’s daily life. To live morally is to live spontaneously and to achieve this, virtues must be developed in order to become a better being. By abstaining from pleasures, this can truly form a moral man. One must live in greatness; in a form that reflects their worth. Should they be dishonest and corrupt, engaging in subjectively pleasurable activities, then their morality is lacking, and this Golden Mean is not achieved. Therefore, it can be seen that Virtue ethics varies significantly from corruption, and a universal application of such a theory cannot retract the damage it has done culturally. However, it can be stated that ethical practices vary globally, and the desire to do good remains the same. For example, in the United States, shaking hands shows a sign of friendship, but within Asian societies, individuals bow to communicate their friendship and respect for one another. Therefore, there should be no classification nor difference in the expressions of behaviours in these different moral systems; different behaviours eventually express similar intentions. It is a universal concept. Foot notes that all societies appear to consider certain characteristics as moral virtues, such as honesty. This could infer that the global morality Virtue ethics holds is integral to the progression of a corrupt-free world. <nl><nl>Further, Virtue ethics focuses solely on the pursuits of behaving morally and living life by way of virtue and wisdom. This ‘eudaemonia’ is sought to be a ‘socially unifying concept’ of ultimate fulfilment, particularly that one can be happy without jeopardising the happiness of someone else. Individuals who possess such virtues naturally act in a degree of excellence, but they also project their values through their actions. Despite progression to a more modernist way of living, which may involve some form of corruption, virtue ethicists wholly pursue a good life and live according to such virtues. Within this normative theory, every human experience has a narrative. To act in an ethical manner, they should seek to display the most morally fulfilled way of life. But surely there is a risk of corrupt behaviour here. This narrative should not be achieved by damaging someone else’s life as it is unreasonable for fulfilment to arise from conflict in behaviours as these conflicts with this ‘unifying project of eudemonia’.  To not ‘encroach on anyone’s behaviour’, one must identify which actions constitutes virtuousness. Cunningham suggests that although Virtue ethics does not provide a concrete structure for decision making, there are some scenarios which provide enough clarity to suitably reflect such ideologies. In such scenarios, one should acknowledge the virtues present and respect them whilst also acknowledging vices, such as corruption. Holistically, even if one course of action seems advantageous, to reflect on this personal narrative is most appropriate. Though it seems easier to take a route which overlooks virtue, it is no way to live in the long-term, and to engage in corruptive behaviours compromises this. To obtain a sense of inherent morality is a lifelong haul and virtue cannot be displayed on a selective basis. <nl><nl>Virtues and vices are quite the opposite. Virtues are entrenched in honesty and truthfulness. Therefore, individuals within administrations that engage in dishonesty by taking bribes for example, is serious corruption; something that is reflected as being inherently morally evil. There is a ‘broad array of misbehaviour’ as to take bribes in secrecy behind the backs of those in the workforce removes elements of transparency. And though this may not affect every single person, a eudemonist approach is the best route. Hence, these public administrations have a duty to establish ethical standards by promoting an honest and compassionate government. But should they portray such virtues, corruption may still occur. A dishonest individual’s intentions may be hidden through a false pretence of morality, allowing them to achieve an easy and comfortable life that is ‘morally bankrupt’ at the expense of others. This suggests the theory is greatly flawed with its outdated nature and ‘misty, antiquarian air’.<nl><nl>Virtue ethicists refer to morality as being the most integral part of an individual, and to ensure a better world, the world needs better people. Dawson and Bartholomew state that instead of increasing the number of ethical rules, there must be more focus on producing more inherently honest individuals. Perhaps this can be appropriately assessed in conjunction with the work of Aristotle; there must be a middle road between the ethical absolutism of Socrates and the ethical relativism of Sophists. This Virtue ethics views morality as ‘both a human convention and the product of a reasoned search’ on what a good person is. <nl><nl>Virtue ethics and the disguise of corruption <nl>The theory remains vague. Raising the question as to whether those who fight corruption are truly moral characters. For example, when assessing the World Bank and the IMF, though these two organisations are deeply invested in the international portrayal of morality, they are also seen to be highly controversial. It appears to be ironic that two organizations who overtly abide by these ethical practices and are promoters of a ‘global free enterprise’, contradict Klitgaard’s general anti-corrupt formula (C=M+D-A). Both display a great deal of discretion (D) as well as being monopolistic, (M) but are not accountable (A). With reference to corruption, they do not discuss that privatisation has increased the amount of corruption to countries where they have given loans to. Further, these organizations anti-corruption strategies are more inconclusive than can be seen. Being public bodies, funded by taxpayers, with the goal to promote their global interest, they can even be seen to ‘misuse the public office for private gain’. Though they are also very socially involved organisations, Everett states that Virtue ethics forces one to criticise their dubious moral characters. To promote a more ethical business climate, in order to increase business itself, it must be understood that these individuals are less than virtuous characters. Yes, a Virtue ethics perspective does ensure an insight into this global anti-corruption, but Maguire proposes that balance is needed to ensure that moral judgement depends on what is perceived as the most appropriate action within a specific situation.  But, should this be further analysed, principles and goals are a necessary step in the progression of moral development. Until humans are personally involved in their tasks, then they are not competent performers. Hence, the attempt to better oneself is evidences virtuosity. Therefore, Virtue ethics may be necessary in a world that seeks to reduce corruptive actions and can be done so by way of reform via this theory. Nonetheless, the theory ‘lacks fully developed examples’ in contemporary literature suggesting it is outdated and does little to aid the reduction of global corruption.<nl><nl>Religious influences upon corruption <nl>Should we truly assess its definition, corruption is defined as the ‘misuse of entrusted power for private gain’. And though such a phenomenon is significantly witnessed as being greater in some countries, researches agree that this has a negative effect upon its development. It appears to be an ‘important variable’ of both social and cultural conditions. Perhaps this can be addressed deeper with reference to religion. The virtues in a particular religion navigate a hierarchal system that the country follows. These countries may have cultural factors that are underpinned by religion, affecting human behaviour as a result. Essentially, to follow religious practices because it is ‘virtuous’, so, to truly believe you are doing good, may in fact be the latter and covertly corruptive. For example, though embezzlement and bribery are forbidden in both Christianity and Islam, these forms of corruption are present in Islamic and Catholic countries. <nl><nl>Moreover, in both these religions, corruption was significantly greater because of its damaging effects upon democracy and equality. It is a negative phenomenon. It is a vice; so it is interesting that Islamic countries have some of the highest corruption levels in the world. To be a virtue ethicist, one must do what the ‘virtuous agent’ should. But it goes one step further. Individuals must emulate the virtuous person and seek to be a virtuous agent as opposed to act like one. If one follows Islam, believing that some of its extremist views are for the betterment of oneself, and completing particular actions they believe may achieve Aristotle’s ‘Golden Mean’, then why are they rooted in such violence? For better understanding, the Sharia law permits that women be stoned to death for adultery as it is a legally sanctioned punishment outlined in the Iranian Penal Code. Haugh argues that though Islam prohibits ‘every type of fraud and deception’ it still contributes to the oppression of women under this social guise of being moral. It is not mentioned to stone a woman in the Qur’an; thus, using the pretence of religion to employ corruptive behaviour and degrade women demonstrates negative influences of this hierarchal system and the violation of basic human rights. Men can engage in polygamous relationships, but women are punished for being adulterous. Moreover, the ‘misuse of religion’ plays a significant role as it fails to properly teaching of basic moral and ethical values, engaging in ‘pure, self-centred materialistic objectives’ instead. This suggests that religious countries may have vices disguised as virtues, leading to corruption, thus being a global phenomenon.  Virtue ethics therefore does not do enough to control the negative implications in which religion is manipulated for selfish purposes. It enables this phenomenon as opposed to reducing it. <nl><nl>Political corruption<nl>When assessing its political origins, one can agree that through demonstration in totalitarian societies of Nazism and Communism in the 20th century, corruption is an inevitable concept that is ‘deeply entrenched’ in society. In political philosophy, corruption is a fundamental concept which signifies the destruction and degradation of a community. This degradation of society has been evident for years. In Plato’s political philosophy, corruption is fundamental in the movement of  an ideal state to a tyrannical one. When looking at government of Montesquieu, corruption was present as a danger to the republic. Corruptive relations may lead to the destruction of particular principles between legislative, executive and legal powers of state, challenging the unity of the republic, essentially leading to the breakdown of the state in a society dominated by power as opposed to fairness and justice. It has been present for generations and corruption is necessary to progress politically. <nl><nl>However, though essential in a political economy of society, relating to the social exchange of goods, it is also the ‘negation of established structures’ making it extremely dangerous for the political economy of societies. It gives rise to a ‘model of destruction and dissolution’ within society. Should bribery occur to achieve a social advantage, corporations that use this method change their identities from being an actor to agent, overlook social structures of sellers and buyers making it increasingly destructive to the ‘ideals of free competition’. Therefore,  corruption appears as a fundamental threat to the economy because of links to destruction and disruption of these once established rules of social exchange of buyers and sellers. It appears as a ‘vicious circle’ of corrupt economics increasing risks of bribery. Therefore, elements of Virtue ethics may be put into place to stop this \"vicious circle\" from destroying the previous ethical, economic practices. <nl><nl>Corruption literature must be analysed through exploration of this global theory. This involves bribery, abuses of public roles and resources, and mistrust of power. DeLeon asserts that when viewing political corruption in the United States, it is a ‘cooperative form of unsanctioned (…) policy for significant personal gain’ and such bribery varies culturally. Notably, one culture may offer some money to a public official as a bribe, but other cultures consider this to be goodwill. Hence, societies appear as different in the way they consider self-interest. This is a key feature of anti-corruption campaigns. Corruption is a misuse of public power suggesting it is relational. Yes, there may be differences between levels of petty and grand corruption, but the definition is overall ubiquitous. Though it varies, it is unquestionably a global phenomenon. For decades, a ‘corruption eruption’ continues to be witnessed. The economic integration of globalisation appears to ‘collectively contribute’ to the corruptive circumstances. Nonetheless, moral reasoning is vital in order to become less corrupt. Dramer asserts that a two-part programme must be put in place to build character development and develop virtues such as honesty, loyalty and benevolence to positively contribute to ethical imaginativeness.  But even with such measures put in place, more needs to be done to stop the nature of corruption and Virtue ethics alone does not provide ultimate relief for this phenomenon. <nl><nl>Morality, the Law and Virtue ethics<nl>There is great debate on the links between Virtue ethics and the law. Though the theory primarily focuses upon the inner life of a person, questions can be raised with regards to whether it is truly capable of doing the law justice. It holds many constraints. Stole argues that the current model based upon Aristotelianism fail to explain how morality is governed. If general principles do not govern individual morality, then they can do so in the form of laws. They can govern policies and elements of morality need not be present and threaten such an approach. Should these policies be governed by Virtue ethics’ internal morality, this agent-based approach, then the possibilities of ‘real constraint on action’ appear to be doubtful. Hence, the law is separate from morality. Morality has no relationship to corruption in this sense, as the law is entirely derivative’ from the motives and characteristics of individuals who appear to act corrupt suggesting Virtue ethics is separate. <nl><nl>However, elements of Virtue ethics are present in the law. Greenberg proposes a more radical view that the law is the ‘moral impact of the relevant actions of legal institutions’ hereby stating that it is a subset of morality. The impact that our moral rights and duties have is authorised by the actions of legal officials. Thus, these legal obligations are genuine ones that are obtained in a Virtue of the actions of legal institutions. Perhaps this may view the law as present to be a set of officials that are authorized to take actions to resolve disputes; displaying morality and duty to do good as a result of such actions. Therefore, the links between Virtue ethics, and this inner duty to do good is reflected inherently within the law. Should the law mould itself to become a ‘theoretical authority’ regarding moral obligations, then corruption can be reduced with a more subjective stance upon the law. Nonetheless, links between the law and morality may not be present at all. Enoch states that ‘triggering reasons’ are sufficient justifications to act in a socially-approved way. This infers a more common observation for the law taking such actions and perhaps the need for Virtue ethics and normative morality is rejected.<nl><nl>Legal implications<nl>Both Hart and Kelsen propose that the law is a normative system. This nature of law must focus on legal normativity and to truly assess the position of Virtue ethics; corruption and the law, one must dissect the connections between this legal normativity and morality. Particularly, the Kelsenian approach asserts that all normative systems are both structurally and logically similar, but each normative system appears as independent of every other system. It can be concluded that the law is ‘conceptually separate from morality’. Kelsen further argues that the normative nature of law is assigned to both \"is\" and \"ought\" statements and that the implications for every normative conclusion must lead to a normative premise. Therefore, in a normative system like the law, or morality and religion, this \"ought’ aspect indeed requires justifications from a more general \"ought statement\" thus leading to a normative hierarchal structure and somewhat ‘sceptical conclusions’ regarding morality. By way of example, one may accept or reject the ultimate norm, to do what \"the Creator God commands\". The fact that these vital normative systems of an individuals’ life, such as morality and the law, can be accepted or rejected leads to great ambiguity and ‘relativistic implications’. This suggests that Virtue ethics is uncertain, morality does little to reduce corruption which may need to be resolved via objective methods instead. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, corruption is indeed identified as a global phenomenon and Virtue ethics does little to help the reduction of such behaviours. In fact, being one of the oldest theories in Western philosophy, Virtue ethics is outdated, and quite frankly forgotten. Though there are elements displayed in religion, elements of the law, and general society, it fails to inhibit the spread of corruption. Virtue ethics’ subjectivity does little justice to an increasing issue evident within the modern world. Believing in such an idealistic theory perhaps ensures more damage than betterment thus concluding that this global phenomenon will continue regardless.",

It remains concerning that fraudulent conduct has greatly impacted the functioning of many cultural societies and organizations.

Hi there, I’m trying to upload my placement details on to system but I’m not having much luck. I have not been given an official start-end date as it’s part of a organisation for a University, so they themselves do not know whether work will be remote or not and therefore have not given me a date. I’ve been told I will start around June, which is fine but system won’t allow me to submit an unknown end date, should I just put NovemberJuly and alter it later if necessary? Secondly, all my placement details have been confirmed via Skype calls with the odd email also confirming some minor details. On system, it is asking for two placement documents; a job description and a signed contractoffer letter. I do not have either of these things as all my contact has been made via Skype, is it possible I submit some emails which confirm my placement?

      "raw_text": "Rationale: <nl>March 2020 when universities, schools, jobs, and lifestyle was put on hold for a four-month national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact of COVID-19 on the populations mental health has been major. The lockdown meant people had to stay home and isolate from loved ones and family members. This led to people experiencing anxiety and depression as they could not go out and enjoy their social life (Cao et al., 2020). The action orientated analysis aims to derive the importance of investigating potential discourses surrounding the topic of COVID-19 impact on student’s mental health. Discourse analysis is based upon a semi structured interview collecting qualitative data (Smith., 1995) and focused on the research question, students’ attitudes towards the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. The interview schedule in the appendices shows the formation of this question and constructs potential discourses such as mental health, students’ lives, and future impact. Discourse analysis was chosen as the appropriate form of analysis for this investigation in order to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which students discuss and express their attitudes on COVID impact on mental health and how powerful this subject matter is in today’s society. Willig (2015) showed how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language, thus why it is appropriate for this topic. For confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Ellie in this analysis.<nl><nl>Results:<nl>Discourse 1- ‘loneliness is killing us’.<nl>Ellie understands the mental impact COVID-19 has had on the general population. This is shown when she describes some experiences faced during the pandemic. In this extract Ellie explains how mental health has been a huge topic of conversation during the pandemic.<nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie suggests that due to lockdown many people’s health and mental wellbeing has been affected as they have been stuck indoors for many months with hardly any social interaction or without seeing any family members. \"organisations have signposted mental health really well\" (line 30-31) suggesting that other businesses have done a better job than the government has done in helping mental health. She also touches upon the fact that people in care homes have had it rough as for many months they have not seen their loved ones leading to loneliness and further mental damage. The discourse of mental health shows what impact COVID-19 has had on many lives in today’s society. Ellie suggests that many people in the future may face social anxiety as they have been stuck indoors with no other social interaction heading to increased social anxiety when meeting people again or not knowing how to interact anymore. This portrays that Ellie knows what is going on around her and is aware of the mental hardship many are facing during these unforeseen circumstances, however she feels as though she does not know what to do to help others.<nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie develops this discourse as a lack of social interaction the older generation has faced during this pandemic has had a mental and physical impact on many peoples lives. She suggests that due to the pandemic people are stuck indoors and many cant visit relatives in care homes or their houses as its dangerous causing \"isolation and loneliness\" (line 13). Ellie also mentions that many people may have loved ones in care homes who they cannot go and visit or may have to see them from a distance. This suggests that Ellie is worried about how families would cope with not seeing loved ones for so many months and how the deadly disease of Alzheimer’s and dementia can play a huge role during this pandemic. Ellies use of language and expression shows how worried she is for many families in this situation especially at these uncertain times.<nl>Discourse 2- ‘Students trapped indoors’. <nl>The impact of COVID-19 on students has been a running discourse throughout the whole interview. \"students feel like they are trapped indoors they cannot live like a student’s\". portrays the anger Ellie feels when it comes to her views on the impact of the pandemic on university students, as Ellie herself is a first-year university student, she has many strong views on this discourse.<nl><data_extract><nl>Here Ellie explains the impact of COVID-19 on students’ lives. She explains how university social life is non-existent as students cannot \"mix with other households\" this can be inferred as social isolation as Ellie feels like she cannot go out and meet others away from her flat she feels trapped with the same people every day who may not share same interests as her course mates who she cannot meet. This discourse shows Ellies frustration of being kept indoors and locked down from having fun and also enjoying what is meant to be university lifestyle. She feels as though her \"nightlife has been diminished\" (line 40) suggesting a growing concern of social isolation and not able to enjoy their prime childhood. Many goes on to explain how many students have moved to different parts of the country for university without their parents or loved ones and then thrown into social isolation. This can be traumatising for students at such a young age adding to loneliness and many other mental health problems. You can infer from Ellies speech that she is not happy with the handling of the pandemic for university students as they have no support from the government and are left to survive by themselves (lines 28-32). <nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie explains how many students are affected in schools. With the lockdown in March many schools were closed therefore students were at home for many months without having any homework or learning. Ellie spoke about how children \"lost interest and concentration\" and \"struggled fitting into school\" showing that she empathises with pupils as education is the most important at this age in order to build a strong future. She goes on to explain how children could not see their friends or teachers who may be their support and their happiness leading to loneliness and scared to go back to school as they have a loss in routine (70-73). From this we can infer that children at schools miss the social life of talking to their friends and having that support network as are too young to understand the implications of this pandemic, they just want to enjoy with their friends. This can induce loneliness and social boredom which is not great at such a young age.<nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie develops this discourse of acknowledging the fact that students may be disadvantaged in the job industry as many students are on cheap labour and are working parttime for minimum wage. This means that students are more likely to be made redundant as firms may not be able to afford to keep them on during this pandemic. Ellie recognises the harsh impact of students losing their jobs can have an impact on their mental health as the stress and anxiety of not being able to work to afford rent or their lifestyle can be a huge impact. <nl>Discourse 3- ‘uncertain future’<nl>Ellie develops the discourse of uncertain future during this pandemic as many people may have struggled to cope with this year in general mentally and physically. With many Highstreet business and shops closing down Ellie does not know what the future will hold. She questions how the government debt will be paid off if people cannot afford to pay taxes.<tab><nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie demonstrates what the future will look like in her eyes. With the increased government borrowing Ellie is worried how that would be paid back and if she will be able to pay it back as she is worried, she may not earn enough money due to a lack in jobs and a shrinking economy. She is also concerned about the population’s future mental health, and how the long-term effects of the pandemic will play apart. As Ellie is a student, she is also worried about her student debt going up even though the debt is high in the first place as university is all online. She feels that university is a scam and is not worth the 9k she pays for online lectures. Ellie understands that it will take time to build the economy and lifestyle again and that as mental health has been well signposted, spoken about and made a topic of conversation many people may bounce back stronger than ever while using all the support given (lines 90-95). This shows that Ellie understands what the future will look like after the pandemic is over and how many people may overcome this trauma.<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion the discourses throughout the interview shows the scared uncertain and worried student expressing views on the pandemic that is currently damaging our lives and our mental health.  The increase in loneliness, anxiety, and depression amongst individual during this pandemic needs to be made a topic of conversation. There is a lot of help out there. Students have been greatly affected by this pandemic especially first year students as they have missed out on social events like freshers where they have chances to meet new people and make friends. This already adds to the loneliness as many of the students have moved away from home with not knowing anyone at their university. Many recent studies on the impact of the pandemic on mental health support Ellies views as mental health is on the decline due to anxiety depression and loneliness impacted by the lockdown and the isolation (Cullen et al., 2020).

Hello, I have attached the financial support form with some evidence that I could find. I hope this helps and is enough to help me stop stressing about the financial hardship I am facing currently. Thank you, . (Second year student) To whom this may concern, I am currently a second year student studying at this university. I do not live in Seattle therefore I am currently renting a private property near university. However due to this Pandemic and lockdown I cannot travel or stay in San Antonio this means I am paying terrible amounts of rent at a place I have not being staying at since September. I had a job during first year which helped me pay for rent and bills however this year I have lost my job and recently one of my parents has been made redundant from their job and therefore I we are struggling to make ends meet. I have a sister who just started university in November and also is paying rent for a place she is not staying at. Finances are hard at the moment. We are barely making ends meet. I thought I’d contact the financial team for any guidance on how to go about either getting extra funding or any help. Hope to hear from you soon! Thank you very much. . (Second year student) Hi, Sorry for the inconvenience however the next student finance drop is in June. I have to pay this months rent and also next months rent with the money I have in my account. This means I will only just have enough for bills and to have food on the table. My overdraft is never touched as going into overdraft gives me anxiety and stress therefore I try and not use it. Is there any other way I can be helped financially? Will be a great help and most appreciated. Thank you very much ! . (Second year student) Oh sorry, thank you very much! . (Second year student)"

Thirdly, for me the whole process of constantly applying for jobs within organisation has been very rewarding. Overtime, I have began to understand what exactly employers are looking for and have been able to directly link my experience back to the job I am applying for both in my interview and applications. The process has allowed for new career-related doors to open for me especially at the right time too because looking back I wouldn’t have been able to work for organisation during university.

The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10.

The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these.

      "raw_text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that is widely identified as having impairments on communication and behaviour. The DSM-V refers to social-emotional reciprocity deficits, difficulties in maintaining relationships and deficits in non-verbal communication as diagnostic criteria for Autism (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Memory functions are another aspect of autism that are talked about frequently, in particular, with executive functions (EF). Studies have shown that autistic individuals (AI) struggle with EF. For example, Bennetto et al. (1996) compared AI to individuals that suffer from frontal lobe brain lesions (extensively known for memory impairments) and found that they scored similarly on standardised EF tasks, showing an impairment on their executive functioning. It is important to note that this study was conducted with high-functioning AI so may not speak for all on the spectrum, nevertheless it has been a prominent study in the field of memory and AI. <nl>Regarding gathering evidence from autistic witnesses (AW), a few studies have looked at their performance on line-ups, but a lot of the research has focused on formal interviews. The Cognitive interview (CI) is an interview method that significantly improves the detail and accuracy of witness reports across various witness groups and is used highly in the US and UK (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). However, research by Maras and Bowler (2010) found that when conducting the CI on AI, they were less accurate on all sections of the CI compared to the control of typically developing (TD) matched adults. Further study results also suggest that it isn’t an efficient method of interviewing AW, therefore I will list out a few recommendations that may improve evidence gathering from AW in an interview setting.<nl><nl>One key aspect in conducting the CI or other enhanced interviews is the ‘context reinstatement’. Fisher and Geiselman (1992) stated that context reinstatement requires witnesses to mentally return to the incidentcrime for access to the cues that are representative of the incident context. However, for AW and AI this does not seem boost accuracy or recall but in fact reduce their accuracy and lead to reporting more incorrect details (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). One explanation for this is that AI struggle with episodic memory and the relational binding of events. Bowler et al. (2014) presented this as they conducted a study with autistic participants and TD participants where they viewed coloured drawings in a grid. In one condition, they were asked to recall either the item, colour, or location of the drawing and in the other condition, they were asked to recall the item and colour or the item and location. Results showed that participants with autism did significantly worse in the second condition on both trials. The findings suggest that AI show diminished relational binding compared to TD individuals. However, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested it may not be a relational binding problem but rather the excess use of cognitive functions. Solomon’s study into memory involved autistic adolescents compared to Bowler’s adults which could suggest age-specific differences regarding relational binding.<nl>Maras et al (2014) argued that the self-administered interview (SAI) combated the caveats for context reinstatement and the social aspect of the CI. The SAI was developed by Gabbert et al. (2009) to initially preserve the memory of the incidentcrime soon after it occurs. <nl>Maras et al. used the SAI with AW and despite the perceived benefits, it did not increase the rate of correct details recalled. However, one aspect of the SAI that they found to be useful was the Sketch component as autistic participants found it easier to recall more details with drawing in relation to the event. Maras et al. suggested that this aspect of the SAI may reduce the cognitive demands on AI. To further support this, Mattison et al. (2015) conducted studies with the sketch reinstatement of context (Sketch-RC) and mental context reinstatement (MCR) on autistic children and TD children and found that autistic children in the Sketch-RC condition (which consisted of drawing everything they could remember from the earlier video they watched) did significantly better than the autistic children in the MRC condition. In this study by Mattison et al. the results only supported free recall so a further study (Mattison et al., 2018) assessed the same conditions also in a probed setting (cued recall) but found that autistic children still did not have higher accuracy or detail but they did make significantly fewer errors than autistic children in the MRC condition.<nl>Therefore, to aid AI and AW in investigative interviews, the results from these studies suggest that it may be worth adding a sketch element to interviews, especially with children, as though it may not make  the largest difference in detailed recall, it can reduce the amount of errors made, leading to better information gathered for the police.<nl><nl>One recent recommendation that is also based off improving the recall of AW is the Witness-aimed First Account (WAFA). The WAFA (Maras et al., 2020) is another method of alternate interviewing where AW self-direct their recall. They stated that while Sketch-RC and the CI use unbounded narrative recall, the WAFA uses segmentation.. During the WAFA study, both autistic and TD participants watched an intact narrative version and narratively scrambled version of a crime video in a WAFA and control interview condition. WAFA condition participants were asked to segment aspects of their recall through questions such as, what the most important part of the video was, or what else had happened. The interviewer then returned to the noted segments and asked the participant to recall what had happened for each segment mentioned, in the same order they mentioned them in. Maras et al. found that autistic participants recalled around 15% more correct information as well as TD participants compared to the control condition. However, autistic participants still recalled less than TD participants with the WAFA which leads to more uncertainty of why AW still can’t do as well as TD individuals. Also, in the present study, the time between watching the two videos and conducting the interview was 30 minutes which is unrealistic in a real-life setting. A longer wait may reduce the ‘effects’ of the WAFA, as memory worsens over time or it could also surprisingly prove beneficial. <nl>Nevertheless, there is supporting evidence for the segmentation method that the WAFA uses. Zacks and Swallow (2007) talked about segmentation and suggest that the way in which individuals segment events can aid to remembering more and learning better, especially if their events have boundaries. Interestingly, a study into AI and perceiving actions by Zalla et al. (2013) found that among individuals that had to detect boundary transitions in events at ‘fine and coarse’ levels, autistic participants showed reduced accuracy compared to TD participants. These findings support the notion that AI struggle with detecting event boundaries in a traditional sense, which makes it more difficult to provide detail and accuracy in standard or CI. The WAFA appears as a good recommendation as though it requires further research (one of the first studies), it uses framework like Zacks et al. to try and use segmentation for aiding better recall in AI.<nl><nl>A further component mentioned earlier, is the social aspect of interviews with AW.

Participants in the study spoke about the idea of control with IC, such as control over time and how much time they spent on thinking.

This is shown as Collins et al.

      "fixed_text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that is widely identified as having impairments on communication and behaviour. The DSM-V refers to social-emotional reciprocity deficits, difficulties in maintaining relationships and deficits in non-verbal communication as diagnostic criteria for Autism (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Memory functions are another aspect of autism that are talked about frequently, in particular, with executive functions (EF). Studies have shown that autistic individuals (AI) struggle with EF. For example, Bennetto et al. (1996) compared AI to individuals that suffer from frontal lobe brain lesions (extensively known for memory impairments) and found that they scored similarly on standardised EF tasks, showing an impairment on their executive functioning. It is important to note that this study was conducted with high-functioning AI so may not speak for all on the spectrum, nevertheless it has been a prominent study in the field of memory and AI. Regarding gathering evidence from autistic witnesses (AW), a few studies have looked at their performance on line-ups, but a lot of the research has focused on formal interviews. The Cognitive interview (CI) is an interview method that significantly improves the detail and accuracy of witness reports across various witness groups and is used highly in the US and UK (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). However, research by Maras and Bowler (2010) found that when conducting the CI on AI, they were less accurate on all sections of the CI compared to the control of typically developing (TD) matched adults. Further study results also suggest that it isn’t an efficient method of interviewing AW, therefore I will list out a few recommendations that may improve evidence gathering from AW in an interview setting. One key aspect in conducting the CI or other enhanced interviews is the ‘context reinstatement’. Fisher and Geiselman (1992) stated that context reinstatement requires witnesses to mentally return to the incidentcrime for access to the cues that are representative of the incident context. However, for AW and AI this does not seem boost accuracy or recall but in fact reduce their accuracy and lead to reporting more incorrect details (Maras and Bowler, 2010). One explanation for this is that AI struggle with episodic memory and the relational binding of events. Bowler et al. (2014) presented this as they conducted a study with autistic participants and TD participants where they viewed coloured drawings in a grid. In one condition, they were asked to recall either the item, colour, or location of the drawing and in the other condition, they were asked to recall the item and colour or the item and location. Results showed that participants with autism did significantly worse in the second condition on both trials. The findings suggest that AI show diminished relational binding compared to TD individuals. However, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested it may not be a relational binding problem but rather the excess use of cognitive functions. Solomon’s study into memory involved autistic adolescents compared to Bowler’s adults which could suggest age-specific differences regarding relational binding. Maras et al (2014) argued that the self-administered interview (SAI) combated the caveats for context reinstatement and the social aspect of the CI. The SAI was developed by Gabbert et al. (2009) to initially preserve the memory of the incidentcrime soon after it occurs. Maras et al. used the SAI with AW and despite the perceived benefits, it did not increase the rate of correct details recalled. However, one aspect of the SAI that they found to be useful was the Sketch component as autistic participants found it easier to recall more details with drawing in relation to the event. Maras et al. suggested that this aspect of the SAI may reduce the cognitive demands on AI. To further support this, Mattison et al. (2015) conducted studies with the sketch reinstatement of context (Sketch-RC) and mental context reinstatement (MCR) on autistic children and TD children and found that autistic children in the Sketch-RC condition (which consisted of drawing everything they could remember from the earlier video they watched) did significantly better than the autistic children in the MRC condition. In this study by Mattison et al. the results only supported free recall so a further study (Mattison et al., 2018) assessed the same conditions also in a probed setting (cued recall) but found that autistic children still did not have higher accuracy or detail but they did make significantly fewer errors than autistic children in the MRC condition. Therefore, to aid AI and AW in investigative interviews, the results from these studies suggest that it may be worth adding a sketch element to interviews, especially with children, as though it may not make the largest difference in detailed recall, it can reduce the amount of errors made, leading to better information gathered for the police. One recent recommendation that is also based off improving the recall of AW is the Witness-aimed First Account (WAFA). The WAFA (Maras et al., 2020) is another method of alternate interviewing where AW self-direct their recall. They stated that while Sketch-RC and the CI use unbounded narrative recall, the WAFA uses segmentation.. During the WAFA study, both autistic and TD participants watched an intact narrative version and narratively scrambled version of a crime video in a WAFA and control interview condition. WAFA condition participants were asked to segment aspects of their recall through questions such as, what the most important part of the video was, or what else had happened. The interviewer then returned to the noted segments and asked the participant to recall what had happened for each segment mentioned, in the same order they mentioned them in. Maras et al. found that autistic participants recalled around 15% more correct information as well as TD participants compared to the control condition. However, autistic participants still recalled less than TD participants with the WAFA which leads to more uncertainty of why AW still can’t do as well as TD individuals. Also, in the present study, the time between watching the two videos and conducting the interview was 30 minutes which is unrealistic in a real-life setting. A longer wait may reduce the ‘effects’ of the WAFA, as memory worsens over time or it could also surprisingly prove beneficial. Nevertheless, there is supporting evidence for the segmentation method that the WAFA uses. Zacks and Swallow (2007) talked about segmentation and suggest that the way in which individuals segment events can aid to remembering more and learning better, especially if their events have boundaries. Interestingly, a study into AI and perceiving actions by Zalla et al. (2013) found that among individuals that had to detect boundary transitions in events at ‘fine and coarse’ levels, autistic participants showed reduced accuracy compared to TD participants. These findings support the notion that AI struggle with detecting event boundaries in a traditional sense, which makes it more difficult to provide detail and accuracy in standard or CI. The WAFA appears as a good recommendation as though it requires further research (one of the first studies), it uses framework like Zacks et al. to try and use segmentation for aiding better recall in AI. A further component mentioned earlier, is the social aspect of interviews with AW. Again, it is explicit knowledge that AI have many social communicative deficits (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and one qualitative study conducted by Benford and Standen (2009) looked into how high-functioning AI and individuals with Asperger’s preferred internet communication (IC). Participants in the study spoke about the idea of control with IC, such as control over time and how much time they spent on thinking.

(2002) found among conditions of ‘rapport’, ‘neutral’ and ‘abrupt’ interviews, participants recalled more correct information in the ‘rapport’ condition without an increase of incorrect information but were also more willing to co-operate and ‘try harder’ for the interview. One very important factor in these recommendations is that individually, they may not seem to produce extremely yielding results but with more research, it can become clearer which aspects provide better information (such as the sketch aspect in the SAI) or even whether some techniques will work cohesively or not. To conclude, the first two recommendations aim to improve the recall provided by AW and both draw on the Task Hypothesis (Bowler et al., 2004) which suggests that AI have better recall when they are provided with more support on what they want to remember. However, autism is a spectrum disorder, indicating that individuals can be extremely diverse, much research into autism even shows the difference as majority of it looks in to high-functioning AI.
