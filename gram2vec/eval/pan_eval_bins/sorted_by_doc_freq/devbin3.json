Hi Joscelin, I’ve seen the video and it is a big improvement from the last one I received just a bit concerned over the top two teeth. Looks like there’s a little gap at the end of the treatment of my top two teeth and I wouldn’t want any gap between. Do you see where I’m coming from and is there anything that can be done about this or? Kind regards, . Hi Evie, I received an email saying it would be best for us to meet tomorrow on a virtual meeting as it is final year orientation day. Is this something you are able to do tomorrow afternoon as I know you have other students also I was wondering if a phone call would be better as I don’t have many virtual applications on my phone or laptop and have never used them before and fear Of technical issues. Is a phone call something you are able to accommodate? There is a lot of uncertainty right now and I am very uncertain about what the final year is going to entail so it would be a great chance to talk about it with you tomorrow :) Kind regards, ."

I imagine I will be in touch more in July when I come to actually conduct a study in this area. In regard to my plans for scaling the research down to something that could be achieved in an undergraduate dissertation, at the moment I fully intend to \"go bold\" and find some way of administering CBD to subjects on some scale but will definitely make some back-up plans in case this proves impossible. Thank you for sending through those risk assessment and application documents, now I am back in the Uni-work headspace I will have a crack at them! Again, thank you so much for all your support, it feels brilliant to have someone to discuss this sort of thing with! Cheers, . Ps. Good luck with maternity leave!!!"

The hotel I'd recommend is the Hilton Helsinki Strand, it was that or the Radisson Blu but the Hilton had better rooms with a view (can't beat a window-facing bed in the morning!). - 217 Euros per night - Has all your basic hotel stuff, plus Hilton is great anyway - John Steinbergin ranta 4, Helsinki, 00530, Finland. - +358 9 39351 - Check-in 2pm, check-out 12pm For breakfast I found a cute little cafe 'Kuuma' nearby the hotel, great reviews, typical continental-type food, looks great in the sun. - Pohjoisesplanadi (say that fast five times) 33, 00100, Helsinki, Finland. - +358 40 6757772 - Doesn't look like you need to book though, just so you have the number If you're up for a museum trip, go-to looks like the National Musuem of Finland. Google maps it, looks hard to miss, it's huge. There seems to be a great restaraunt a short walk from the city centre, 'Ravintola Nokka', again, great reviews, by the water, and the food looks incredible (think traditional Helsinki but with a modern feel to it?). - Kanavaranta 7 F, 00160, Helsinki, Finland. If you're looking for a souvenier for Esmerelda, there's a traditional-type souvenier shop 'Liopro' just off Helsinki's central market square, plus it gives you a chance to give the market a look. There's also a massive 'Flying Tiger' in the city centre, it's not traditional Finland but it's brightly-coloured Copenhagen-themed stuff, probably a better bet for a young kid if I'm honest. For that night out, there's a brilliant looking rock club called 'Tavastia' nearby, live music and apparently one of Europe's oldest rock clubs? Worth a shot, if you're not a fan there's always a bar by the sea! Anyway those are the ones I found, have a look on tripadvisor and see if there's anything else you'd be up for while you're there? Have fun! Cheers, Mike",

      "raw_text": "Subjective Expected Utility theory is a normative theory of decision making (Neumann &amp; Morganstern, 1944; Savage, 1954). There are five axioms of SEU theory, first there is a preference for decisions to be well ordered so between two options, there should be a preference. The second axiom is preferences should be transitive so if summer is preferred over winter and winter over spring then summer should be preferred over autumn. The third axiom is if there is an indifference between two options, the probability of them being chosen is equal. Fourth is if there is a preference for one option over another so A over B, if presented with two outcomes where one is the first choice leads to A and the second to B, the first option should be chosen. The last axiom is no alternative is infinitely better than any other. These axioms must be fulfilled to assign utilities to outcomes so the expected utility in any decision can be maximised. From the five axioms, the principle of transitivity is derived which is having a preference of option x to y and y to z leading to a preference of x to z. However, Tversky’s (1969) found that preferences are not always transitive and therefore goes against the SEUT.<nl> To account for the violations of the SEU theory the Prospect theory (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979) was proposed which explains that decision making is based upon personal gains and loss aversions. Therefore, predicting the potential decision to be chosen is difficult due to the probability of the decision being picked being distorted as probabilities are over weighted.<nl>Deviations can also be explained by regret theory which found that large differences are over weighted whilst small differences between outcomes are underweighted. Regret theory is also based upon emotions such as disappointment, rejoicing, regret and elation which are anticipated when a result of a decision is known. How the amount of this emotion does not reflect the difference between outcomes accurately.",
