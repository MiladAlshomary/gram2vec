      "raw_text": "Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016).<nl><nl>A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of  interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012).  Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. <nl>A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee’s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation.<nl><nl>Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto &amp; Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing.<nl>However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential.<nl>Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them. <nl>An example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). As well as the 4 main stages of the interview – mental reinstatement of context, reporting from a different perspective, reverse order reporting and in-depth reporting – the interview, more importantly, involves an introduction and a ‘transfer control’ phase (Geiselman and Fisher, 2014). During the introduction, the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions, attempting to build rapport. In the ‘transfer control’ phase, the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves. These two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 2010), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase. These satisfaction levels, in turn, are linked to reduced levels of PTSD type symptoms (Kunst et al., 2013) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events, such as sexual assault. <nl><nl>While the Cognitive Interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (Gwyer and Clifford, 1997), there are problems with its practical application. One problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus, cannot conduct the full interview (Kebbell et al., 1999). Another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992; Kebbell et al, 1999). <nl>Therefore, with these limitations in mind, Heydon and Powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training, as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques, known as written-response interview protocol (WRIP). This approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview. An example of a WRIP approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time – whenever they feel ready – with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall. This written format can then be followed up with a formal interview. In terms of anonymous reporting, a WRIP that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the Cognitive Interview techniques. For instance, a WRIP for confidential reporting must begin with an ‘Engage and Explain’ phase that includes the Cognitive Interview’s ‘report everything’ phase. While still remaining anonymous, it is important to still engage with the interviewee, to show sensitivity to them. Thus, it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims. <nl><nl>With the WRIP approach, many of the Cognitive Interview limitations are addressed. By allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime, the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face-to-face interview phase, reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview. Furthermore, by incorporating these two techniques together, the victims’ satisfaction levels, rapport building, and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised, rather they are further encouraged. However, it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations. Nevertheless, theoretically, this collaboration appears to be the ‘Golden Standard’ and ‘fool-proof’ in the context of investigative interviewing. Therefore, with such considerations in mind, the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>In conclusion, interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky. Regardless of age, gender, size, etc. reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual. It is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them. Nevertheless, it is the legal justice system’s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward. It is the police’s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime. Considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward, this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice. Both of these recommendations have a key thing in common – building rapport. Thus, it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing, building rapport is the most important aspect.",

      "raw_text": "The case, Smith, was heard in the Courts Martial Appeal Court on 25th March 1959. The defendant, a private soldier named Thomas Joseph Smith, stabbed three of his comrades during a fight, with a bayonet in the army regiment barracks. One individual had two bayonet wounds which ‘pierced a lung and caused a haemorrhage’. On his way to the medical reception, the victim was dropped twice. Moreover, he then received incorrect medical treatment, and was negligently treated by the medical staff who failed to diagnose the puncture. The victim died, leading the defendant to be convicted with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, in relevance to s.1 Offences Against the Person Act 1861. <nl>The regimental sergeant-major ‘put his company on parade’ after the fight, detaining them until someone confessed. Smith, as a result, admitted to the stabbing at the parade. The following day, Smith was visited by a sergeant from the Special Investigations Branch who administered a caution and requested for a written admission. Both statements were given as evidence at the trial. <nl>The issue lies in the argument of who is liable for the death of the victim, whether it was due to the negligence of the doctor or the defendant’s actions of stabbing the victim in the army barracks. The relevant law for murder is actus reus, which is unlawful killing, and mens rea, which is the intention to kill or cause GBH. The defendant satisfies both, as his act of stabbing the victim led to the consequence of his death (results crime). Smith also had indirect intention, as he may not have wished for the given outcome, but it was virtually certain to occur because of his actions. It can be said that he committed voluntary conduct of actus reus as he did have control over his actions. This can be supported by Lord Denning’s statement, ‘the requirement that it should be a voluntary act is essential, not only in a murder case, but also in every criminal case as no act is punishable if it is done involuntarily’ in Bratty.<nl>The defendant claimed the soldier did not instantly die, it was rather the injuries encountered on his journey to receive medical attention, and the doctor mistreating him which caused his death. The doctor had a duty of care to attend to the necessary needs of the patient, which did not occur as he was given artificial respiration after a failure of saline solution transfusion, which arguably contributed to his death as ‘the treatment that he was given was thoroughly bad’. The duty of care ‘was breached, and as a direct result of the breach, the patient suffered harm’. This is supported by Dr. Camps, who provided evidence for the defence and stated the victim’s chances of improvement were ‘as high as 75 per cent’. <nl>Furthermore, the defendant appealed that the alleged confessions were wrongly admitted as evidence. Represented by Roderic Bowen QC and H.K Woolf, it was argued on his behalf that the ‘first admission was inadmissible’ primarily due to the proceedings being soiled from the threat posed by the sergeant-major. Arguably, this was conceded further in the second admission made as the order persisted, therefore the fear of threat concludes the confession to be involuntary. It was reminded to the court that the relationship between the individuals must be considered as the young soldier is obliged to follow the orders of his major, so he had to obey the orders given. <nl>The Crown, represented by E. Garth Moore, stated that the threats posed ‘were not directed to the accused alone, but to a whole company’ so the first admission can be addressed as admissible. It was explained that the sanction was so trivial that it would be ‘almost an abuse of language to call it a threat’. The s.36(1) Medical Act 1983 states if a fully registered person is judged by the Professional Conduct Committee to have been guilty of serious professional misconduct while registered or not, the Committee may direct that his name shall be erased from the register, which the medical staff are faced with in this case. With such a severe consequence, it can be argued that the medical staff ensured they were accurate in their actions to uphold professional conduct. Furthermore, the action of the third party involved, the medical staff, performed a reasonable response to the defendant’s original act. Despite reducing chances of recovery, it is argued that their act did not break the chain of causation because it was not ‘free, voluntary and informed’, as said in Pagett. <nl>In Cheshire, the defendant ‘shot the victim in the thigh and stomach, the wounds necessitated surgery from which he developed breathing difficulties’, for which he had to have tracheotomy. Due to rare complications in surgery, the victim died. Although, the ‘complication was a direct consequence of the appellant’s acts which remained a significant cause’ to the death of the victim, it was concluded, using precedents from the case of R v Smith, that there was no break in the chain of causation. The judge told the jury that if they find the chain of causation to be broken, they must believe that ‘the medical treatment or lack of it was reckless in the sense that those administering it were careless of the consequences’. It was concluded that the defendant’s actions were still an operating and substantial cause of the victim’s death, therefore the appeal was dismissed. This differs to Jordan where the victim was given antibiotics to deal with stab wounds, however he had an allergic reaction due to the doctor’s misconduct of not thoroughly checking records, and he died. The court, in this case, concluded that the defendant’s actions did satisfy novus actus interviens, so the chain of causation was broken. Byrne J, stated that the death was not ‘consequent upon the wound inflicted’, but for the actions of the defendant. <nl>In the present case, the court concluded the encountered negligence received does not break the chain of causation, and it is the fault of the defendant for the victim’s death. Lord Parker CJ, one of the three judges of the case, stated that the action undertaken by the sergeant-major was appropriate. While what was said by the regimental sergeant-major was a threat, it assisted to provide further information for inquiries to be made. He stated that an individual’s confession beyond the court is solely admissible if voluntary, therefore Smith’s first admission cannot be acceptable. On the other hand, the second statement is admissible as ‘it is clear that the effect of any original inducement or threat under which the first statement was made had been dissipated’. Furthermore, when the second confession was made, the circumstances were different such as the passing of nine hours, the parade had ended, and the threat was spent. The change in circumstances alters the validity of the admissions therefore it is acceptable for the second confession to be addressed as admissible. <nl>According to Lord Parker CJ, ‘if at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause of death is also operating’. It could not be due to the medical negligence faced, as ‘an original wounding is the only reason that treatment and presence in a hospital would be required’. Based on this, it can be disputed that despite the series of unfortunate events after the stabbing, the death only occurred due to the original stabbing from Smith, so the ‘wound was still an operating cause and a substantial cause of death’. The victim would not be in hospital but for the stabbing, so it would be reasonable to conclude that the stabbing was the reason for his death, satisfying factual causation. This principle upheld the conviction, and the court dismissed the appeal.",
      "fixed_text": "The case, Smith, was heard in the Courts Martial Appeal Court on 25th March 1959. The defendant, a private soldier named Thomas Joseph Smith, stabbed three of his comrades during a fight, with a bayonet in the army regiment barracks. One individual had two bayonet wounds which ‘pierced a lung and caused a haemorrhage’. On his way to the medical reception, the victim was dropped twice. Moreover, he then received incorrect medical treatment, and was negligently treated by the medical staff who failed to diagnose the puncture. The victim died, leading the defendant to be convicted with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, in relevance to s.1 Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The regimental sergeant-major ‘put his company on parade’ after the fight, detaining them until someone confessed. Smith, as a result, admitted to the stabbing at the parade. The following day, Smith was visited by a sergeant from the Special Investigations Branch who administered a caution and requested for a written admission. Both statements were given as evidence at the trial. The issue lies in the argument of who is liable for the death of the victim, whether it was due to the negligence of the doctor or the defendant’s actions of stabbing the victim in the army barracks. The relevant law for murder is actus reus, which is unlawful killing, and mens rea, which is the intention to kill or cause GBH. The defendant satisfies both, as his act of stabbing the victim led to the consequence of his death Medical Act 1983 states if a fully registered person is judged by the Professional Conduct Committee to have been guilty of serious professional misconduct while registered or not, the Committee may direct that his name shall be erased from the register, which the medical staff are faced with in this case. With such a severe consequence, it can be argued that the medical staff ensured they were accurate in their actions to uphold professional conduct. Furthermore, the action of the third party involved, the medical staff, performed a reasonable response to the defendant’s original act. Despite reducing chances of recovery, it is argued that their act did not break the chain of causation because it was not ‘free, voluntary and informed’, as said in Pagett. In Cheshire, the defendant ‘shot the victim in the thigh and stomach, the wounds necessitated surgery from which he developed breathing difficulties’, for which he had to have tracheotomy.

      "raw_text": "Employment relations is a process of socio-economic exchange, and involves a individual performing service or duty in exchange for payment. Employment relations looks at the different aspects of a relationship between an employee and its employer.  Employment relations have a major impact on the UK labour market, this statement is supported by ONS report on the UK labour market which shows from November 2017, there are approximately 32 million people at work with more than half being employed.<nl>The UK government is crucial with regards to employment relations to ensure they are able to meet the key goals of the country. The government acts as the economic manager, this consist of setting the level of wages, tax rate and managing the cost of living.  The government are also classed as regulators of labour markets, this involves initiating new laws and regulations that have an impact upon the relationship between employer and employee. In addition, they play act as the welfare state, ensuring they are able to aid those who have been made redundant or struggling with financial difficulties. Being the largest employer with 5.39 million workers employed, the government sees itself as a eloquent employer and wants to show private sectors how to do this. <nl>This report will look the role the government plays with regards to gender equality in the UK. There has been an improvement in the amount of females in the labour market. Since the beginning, there has always been more men employed them women. The office of national statistics shows during the third quarter of 2020, 78.6% of men were employed opposed to the 71.9% of women who have been employed, a difference of just under 7%, this is near enough the lowest the difference has ever been and is a huge improvement considering the gap was 11.5% ten years ago. These numbers have however been affected heavily by the covid-19 pandemic. The employment rates of males has remained around 70%, however females have increased immensely. Since the great recession in 2008 in which women employment was roughly 67%, women employment has increased by around 5%.  ONS suggests that women employment was at an all time high in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic of 72.6%, showing a positive change from 52.8% in 1971. The changes in state pension age for women has had a slight impact on this increase meaning less females retiring between the ages of 60-65. This increase in the number of women in the labour market has initiated a positive attitude towards the support of gender equality. There are several reasons for the growth in numbers of females in the workforce, one huge reason is the government acting as regulators of labour markets and initiating laws, these laws include the lone parent income support and equality act 2010, equality and human right commission, employment act 2008 and equality act 2006. From the start of 2008 to 2010, male employment rate went down by 4%, whereas for females just under 2% due to so many being made redundant. The years following the UK recession saw a loss in numbers of female full time workers, but an improvement in the number of part time employees. Fortunately, since the end of 2012 the full time employment has grown. During recession, many organisations recruited part time workers and full time workers were made redundant to help with labour costs and still have the same productivity from employees. This process is referred to as labour market flexibility, (Bell and Blanchflower, 2010). And is a process that the state were supportive of to help get the labour market back to the equilibrium, and was beneficial for part time employees.  To have a greater effect, the UK government should have implemented a different strategy in order to support all those affected with the great recession. <nl><nl>Despite many efforts for many years, gender equality is still a major and worldwide issue within the workplace. The global gender gap report 2020 stated there are \"massive inequalities in almost all of the UK’s fasted-growing job clusters of the future\", this is a worrying stat as in order to sustain an effective workforce in the future, it is crucial that women are able to access resources that would aid the upbringing of children, inevitably the future labour market. Improvement in gender equality in the workplace with regards to the opportunities available, would allow women to contribute and support the UK economy. A study conducted by PwC (2020), suggests \"steps have been made towards advancing gender equality, however progress is slow\". This statement comes from results showing that the UK’s position remaining at 16th however still doing better than OECD average.  Another major and insightful fact from this study reports that if the UK were able to achieve the same level of female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by a staggering $252 billion. This supports the importance of allowing women the same opportunities and resources as men and pushing the gender equality agenda, because of the great impact it could have on the UK economy.  An article written by the guardian states, \"the UK has fallen from 15th to 21st\" with regards to being the most equal nation. Although there has been progress in the number of women in the labour market, the UK are still far below its European neighbours with the gender equality rankings and shows that gender inequality is still of a major concern. <nl>Another major dilemma within the workforce is gender pay gap which supports the gender inequality regime. 8,424 private sector employers reported their data, with 3,746 employers noticing their pay gap improve whilst 3,387 seeing pay gap worsen, and 645 employers seeing no change. This supports that the statement that gender equality is still an issue. However, with regards to part-time employees women on average earn more, a possible reason for females earning more in part time field is it gives them flexibility to complete other commitments meaning more women doing part-time and higher earnings.  The state of UK has played its role with the improvement in the gender pay gap with the policies and laws that have been legislated. Companies with more than 50 employees are now required to execute an equal pay audit, this identifies any differences in pay between men and women doing equal work. As an employer, doing an audit shows your dedication to remove any unfair pay.   This comes as a part of the equal pay act 2010, which came into force to give both men and women a right to equal pay for equal work and has been implemented to protect people from discrimination. In 2017, it was compulsory for any company with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gap report, this comes as change as originally companies could publish this voluntarily.  A negative to this law is that it is only compulsory for companies to report, however not actually make amendments to the pay gap. Since the beginning of gender pay gap being analysed, this issue has still not been resolved and could still be a problem for the foreseeable future, this comes as a result of the lack of determination from the UK government to resolve this issue. <nl><nl>To help minimise gender pay gap and to resolve the issue of pay inequality, national minimum wage was enacted as a plan. This is significant as this was the UK governments’ first national and cross-sectural attempt to regulate low pay. Dube (2017) found that in America for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, over the long run, the poverty rate is expected to decline by 5.3 percent, this emphasises the importance of minimum wage.   In 2016, national living wage was implemented to help and support females in the workforce, however with the increase of the minimum national living wage by 4.9% in 2019, nearly 3 million children are still in poverty with parents who are at work. This proves that it is still of a major concern. Women make up 60% of workers on the national living wage, meaning at least one third of females are not on a wage that they could live on. The Fawcett society also mentioned that increasing the minimum wage to the real living wage, would help in resolving the gender pay gap issue.<nl><nl>With regards to public sector, the government are doing there best to set an example to private sector companies, this is evident as an article from the public finance states that based on the number of employees in the senior government roles, UK is top in the EU and only fourth in the G20 nations. Presently, the gender pay gap amongst all employees in the public sector is 15.5%, which is a slight improvement, as in the last decade the gap has increased by roughly 4%. The most recent data conducted by ONS was in 2018, and suggests there has been an increase of 10.9 percentage points from 31 march 2008 to 31 march 2018 which at that point was 42.7% of female employees working at senior civil service level. This is a positive sign and shows gradual improvement year by year. In the executive officer and administrate responsibility levels, there are more females then male employees. Females still dominate with the number of civil service employees, however decreased by 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 which is not a positive sign. To prevent gender inequality occurring within the public sector, the government have enacted public sector equality duty. PSED \"requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity\" (Fredman, 2011).and ensure good relations between employees. This act requires public authorities to published quality objectives every four years as a minimum, also information to show they are cooperating with the public sector equality duty.  PSED has yet to accomplish the goals it was set out to perform, as gender inequality is still present within the public sector.  ONS shows that gender pay gap still exists amongst all of the professions within the public sector, showing more still needs to be done to resolve gender inequality. This affects the government’s stance as aiming to be a role model, and portrays a negative image for the private sector employers. <nl><nl>The UK government has attempted to find the perfect solution for gender inequality and has done this through various techniques including creating new laws to tackle the issues. There are still many issues occurring presently such as , gender pay gap, the number of females in the higher positions in contrast to males, the significant amount of women who are not on a wage that they could live on. One major law that was implemented by the government which was crucial was the Equality act 2010, this was a good intervention is helping with equality, however both males and females being represented equally still seems to be on concern.  Equal pay has gradually been improving, however still seems a long way from the end goal, a solution to this could be a stricter approach towards companies like setting deadlines, ensuring equal pay becomes a priority for companies. To help with the millions of females who struggle to earn a wage to live on, the government should make this a priority by encouraging organisations to pay the real living wage and to make it mandatory. The national minimum wage is a positive for low pay workers (which is dominated by females), however there are still millions who earn less than the real living wage. Therefore the government need to implement new strategies to tackle this.  The positions of more authority within organisations still have majority of men as the employees, the government should encourage females to apply for these higher positions by showing other women who have been able to become employees of these top positions, this could be used as motivation for females to feel that they are also able to achieve these roles. It is vital that the skills and potential of women in the UK are used to a maximum, as mentioned previously if the UK were able to reach the same female employment rate as Sweden, it would increase the GDP by $252 billion, which would help decrease the gender pay gap and boost the economy significantly. This shows if the UK government are able to fulfil their roles efficiently as the biggest employers, and regulators of labour market, they could definitely help with gender inequality in the UK",

      "raw_text": "Faces are vital in conveying emotions and allowing humans to nonverbally interact with each other (Little et al., 2011). It also allows us to distinguish other social drivers such as power, attractiveness, and personality traits, just from a glimpse (Zebrowitz, 2017). Regarding emotion, there has been an ongoing debate to see to what extent facial displays of emotion are universal. With more research coming into the light, arguments have been swayed to not support the idea of universality.<nl><nl>To ‘correctly’ recognise emotion from a facial display can be considered subjective, as one person will not perceive emotion in the same manner as another. Yet some studies have shown the ‘happy’ facial display to be the most correctly recognized facial display out of the proposed seven (Mishra et al., 2018; West et al., 2012). Difficulties come into play when there are a variety of smiles from a ‘happy’ face that can be distinguished (Frank, 2002). This comes to question on the universality of emotions in faces. <nl>This leads on to explain the theoretical models that have been proposed to refute the universality theory of emotions in facial displays. The behavioural ecology view of facial displays (BECV) is one theory from an array of theoretical models which takes the stance against the universality thesis (Crivelli &amp; Fridlund, 2018). It claims that the emotions we express through our faces are a ‘social tool’, meaning that we use our face to nonverbally interact and elicit reactions from humans. The theory had also recognised that facial displays of emotion will vary across different environments, this notion was supported by Crivelli’s own study in the Trobriand Island, where he had found low levels of correct recognition on all five of the facial displays by the Trobrianders (Crivelli et al., 2017).<nl><nl>Further research that supports the BECV has often looked at how facial recognition of emotion differs between culture; the significance of Ekman’s work in cross-cultural studies tends to be cited around this topic. However, with more research around emotion becoming apparent, new studies tend to have a different perspective on Ekman’s study. For instance, in one of his studies, he had reported that the Fore Tribe tended to select the 'surprised' photograph 67% of the time when a story about ‘someone feeling fearful’ was told (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1971). Dailey et al (2010) had found the same result in his study but brought a different angle to the table. He had used Japanese and American participants rather than a small-scale indigenous society; the Japanese participants tended to sway more towards the surprised face when it was a fear face being presented on the screen.<nl><nl>Dailey et al’s (2010) main conclusion on this result was it initially came down to cultural differences, as the Japanese and the Fore tribe have different social contexts compared to the westerners. But specifically, he went to mention in his discussion that Japanese people tend to not fear strangers as much as Americans do (Matsumoto, 1988). In this case, Japanese people would not view the fear facial expression as occasionally in their daily life as Americans, this would therefore explain why they did not correctly identify a ‘fear’ facial display in the tasks when it was presented. Hence, it can be argued that social contexts will affect one’s perceptions of recognising facial displays of emotions.<nl><nl>Nevertheless, studies like the ones mentioned above tend to use facial displays that exaggerate the emotion however, in real life emotions tend to not be expressed in such a ‘cartoon-like’ way, instead, they are more subtle and sometimes even morphed with other emotions. With this being said evidence still shows that there are cultural differences in identifying subtle facial expressions. In a recent study by Zhang et al (2014), they had found that Americans were better at judging subtle negative emotions (angry and sad) than Chinese participants. It is said that this occurs because it is common for Chinese people to express their negative emotions more outwardly, as subtle negative facial expressions might hinder their interpersonal harmony in their society (Matsumoto 1989; Matsumoto and Ekman 1989; Matsumoto et al., 2008). So, subtle negative emotions such as ‘anger’ and ‘sad’ would not be recognised in facial expressions. In essence, this still supports the fact that there are cultural differences regardless of facial expressions being presented in a more subtle or overemphasised manner.  <nl><nl>The studies above clearly emphasize the fact that facial recognition of emotions cannot be universal, as there are significant differences when both cultures were identifying emotions from faces; this comes down to differences in cultural context as they vary in \"social ideologies and practices of the cultural groups\" (Jack et al., 2012). This comes in line to support the BECV theory, as both studies highlight that context is important and impacts a person in identifying emotions from facial expressions.<nl><nl>The cross-cultural studies mentioned above might have some limitations, for example, they tend to only follow an etic approach as researchers will usually be outside of the culture they are studying, which might mean valuable detail in communication could be lost in translation sometimes (Buil et al., 2012). Accordingly, converging neurological studies helps in the understanding of how the brain affects behaviour regardless of social context; so, research in this area would not be impacted by an etic or emic approach, which would help in further understanding why facial recognition of emotion is not universal. <nl><nl>In opposition to the BECV theory, Ekman had proposed an outdated ‘Basic emotions theory’ (BET) which followed a more Darwinian approach. It emphasised that facial expressions of emotion are a biological process and is hardwired, with seven basic emotions that humans can express and identify from (Ekman and Friesen, 1969); therefore, it can show a universal pattern in recognising facial displays of emotion regardless of social context. <nl><nl>The field of neuropsychology has challenged the BET by stating that facial recognition of emotion is not as hardwired and biological as it seems. In regard to the Haxby et model (2000), it has stated that facial perception occurs in the core system (superior temporal sulcus) and then further expands into the extended system in where the amygdala will be able to process emotion from faces. This model is supported by Foley et al’s study (2012) as it found an increase in activity levels of the bilateral STS and the amygdala when perceiving emotions from facial expressions. <nl><nl>The universality thesis comes to be challenged when impairments in the amygdala occur; when the amygdala is impaired there are significant differences that are seen in the processing of negative emotions (Whalen et al., 2013). This will be further examined by looking into individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as they display an atypical amygdala (Kliemann et al., 2012). A study that had shown this had used Ekman and Friesen’s (1976) series of facial displays in an upright and inverted manner, to witness if ASD individuals identified emotions differently (Wallace et al., 2008). They had found that people with ASD were significantly worse at identifying facial displays in both upright and inverted conditions, they had even tended to misidentify 'fear' for 'anger'. This was similarly seen in Ashwin et al’s (2006) study where ASD individuals were more impaired on emotions such as ‘fear’, ‘anger’ and ‘disgust’. This shows that impairment in the amygdala does affect how ASD individuals perceive emotion in faces. <nl><nl>Black et al (2017) had argued that behaviour studies are not able to localise where the difficulty lies in the brain of ASD individuals, so we cannot assume correlation will imply causation. Instead, neuroimaging studies will provide us with the neural specificity to locate what parts of the brain that actually cause this disruption. Hence, a review had examined a variety of neurological studies and had found an association between the amygdala in ASD people and facial emotion recognition (Harms et al., 2010). A supporting study had used a functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that ASD adults had a greater right amygdala activation when viewing facial displays, than neurotypical adults (Monk et al., 2010). <nl><nl>In addition, this evidence can expand to further diagnosis’ such as people with encephalitis, who also have severe amygdala damage; they tend to show the same recognition as ASD individuals with identifying fear and disgust (Sprengelmeyer, 1998). This has been further highlighted in Broks et al (1998) study, where the individuals had difficulties identifying fear in a facial emotion recognition task. This conveys that regardless of what diagnosis or condition a person is suffering from, the damage to the amygdala will impact one’s perception of emotion in faces.<nl><nl>The evidence that is provided above clearly goes against the BET, as ASD and encephalitis individuals were not able to correctly identify negative faces (Broks et al.,1998; Ashwin et al., 2006), meaning that it is not a biological process as Ekman had stated. But despite this, it can still be argued that if ASD individuals did have an intact amygdala, they would correctly identify emotion from faces. However, if this were the case a neurotypical individual would correctly identify all emotions in a facial emotion recognition task, but Wallace et al (2008) had found that the neurotypical individuals still managed to incorrectly recognise anger as disgust 10% of the time. This further complicates the BET, as it shows to not be as hardwired as it mentions. <nl><nl>To conclude the two opposing theories of facial recognition of emotion have two different fields of research. A large body of evidence in cultural differences has come to show that the BECV theory has been an appropriate theoretical model to explain why facial recognition is not universal, additionally, evidence in the field of neuropsychology challenges the BET  model. The converging evidence in these two fields has still come to show that the universality thesis can be refuted.",

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>The topic of research I decided to study is why it’s mostly students who take Humanities and social sciences degrees; specifically, Psychology students, who are interested in East Asian cultures such as Korean culture. This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity.<nl><nl>My main research question is ‘What Psychology students’ experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?’ I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student’s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you’re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. &amp; Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific.<nl><nl>I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes.<nl><nl>Relatability <nl>I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren’t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they’ve been though a lot]\". This further supports the claim that sex workers are not treated fairly and due to their nature of work and even based on just their gender, are not protected but even blamed.<nl><nl>Faith feels that Korean culture is respectful, and group orientated, she states that \"with the whole <nl>South Korean culture like they are all like respectful to each other it’s a culturist culturistic culture so <nl>like I really enjoy that\". From this we can infer that Faith is drawn to the group orientated mindset, <nl>however, I am assuming that when she means ‘culturistic’ she meant collectivist, I did check it by her <nl>to be sure. She feels like South Korean social culture is like South African culture in terms of mutual <nl>respect for the people around you and the collectivism shown amongst people, she mentions that \"I <nl>love working together\" and \"in South Africa you know your neighbours, you know everyone, here <nl>you don’t [know your neighbours] you don’t know your flatmates\" this suggests that she can relate <nl>to Korean culture more than Western culture as they share similar cross-cultural values that she <nl>understands, thus supporting the effect of relatability on her interest in South Korean culture.<nl><nl>Self-discovery<nl>I chose self-discovery as another theme because whilst talking to Faith, I was able to find out that she felt personal connections to some experiences she discussed and felt that they brought out or revitalised parts of her interests or personalities that were previously doormat or overshadowed. <nl>Faith stated that Psychology was her favourite subject during sixth form, and it was the only one she found interesting during A levels \"A levels was like the worst two years of my life\" this suggests that A levels was not an enjoyable time for Faith and further shows how Psychology could have been her favourite subject. She also highlights how her Psychology teacher during that time was really kind and helpful to her \"he helped me like prepare everything to do for uni\" she says now, she does not regret her decision to study Psychology at University all these things combined may have influenced the positive feelings she started to have when first learning Psychology which has led her to pursue it at a higher level.<nl><nl>Faith finds that she is learning more about herself through Psychology even though she believes that \"Psychology involves learning about others\" this suggests that Psychology allows for the personal development of students who study it and gives a chance for them to open their minds and find out about other things that may interest them.<nl><nl>Within the theme of self-discovery, as Faith became more interested in Korean culture, she also became interested in Korean skin care \"South Korea has the best skin care\" this just coincides with the common sentiment of Korean skincare. The country is known worldwide as the plastic surgery capital and for its dermatological research and highly popularised cosmetic culture which includes skin-care routines, this has led to the sale of high quality, mostly affordable products targeted for the skin on the global market (find research stats &amp; qoute). Due to the increased interest in Korean culture, this has also increased accessibility to these things and many media outlets such as Korean music and media, this as a whole, is known as the ‘Hallyu wave’. Faith also expresses her interests in music and media, specifically K-pop, she expressed that she really enjoyed dancing to K-pop groups songs as she was not able to during secondary school, Korean culture \"has brought back like dancing part of me back\" this suggests that exploring the culture further has allowed her to pursue her interests again. <nl>Faith has also taken an interest in Korean food and feels like the country’s cooking practices have entered her cooking style \"like now I’m starting to cook with like Soy sauce [and all these things]\" this shows how influenced Faith has become by Korean culture and how its seamlessly interwoven into her life. She states that \"everything I do now just leads me to them\", the ‘them’ being the main interest points of Korean culture for her e.g., dance and cooking. <nl>Faith also found interest in Korean dramas and movies due to recommendations from friends but was <nl>already interested in other foreign shows \"(.) I just got bored of watching Western stuff\" this suggests <nl>Faith’s willingness to consume media and entertainment different to watch she usually consumes, <nl>indicating an open, which was one of the reasons I expressed for the connection of Psychology <nl>students and their interest in Korean culture as Psychology students usually cultivate an open mind <nl>during their degrees.<nl><nl>Through this analysis of the themes, I have been able to conclude that there is a link between <nl>Psychology students’ experiences with interests in Korean culture whilst focusing on Faith and what  <nl>her experiences are. The link is related to the benefits of open mindedness which allows you to find <nl>new interests pr develop old ones that you previously had, especially open mindedness to cultures <nl>different or similar to your own but in another societal setting.",
