      "raw_text": "Assess the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office.<nl>Unlike many American presidents, the significance of his time in office; his character, values, convictions, and affinities combined with the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the period of his presidency, made his term of significant importance to historians and not his personality and they all agree he had a huge input in the tensions leading up to the Civil War, but historians continue to debate whether the Civil War that occurred right after his administration was inevitable or not (Smith, 2002). This essay is divided into several parts: The first part will explain Buchanan early life, the second part was his congressional and diplomatic career, the third part covers the ‘Bleeding Kansas’ and Dred case, the fourth part will assess the North and South slavery divide and then the last part will conclude assessing the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office.<nl>Early life:<nl>James Buchanan was born to James and Elizabeth Speer Buchanan Sr., immigrants from Ireland. Buchanan was born two years into George Washington’s presidency in 1791 and born in a log cabin, unlike many log cabins births, Buchannan’s father was a successful merchant and could provide for 11 children. As the first-born eldest son, he was especially favoured and had the privilege of attending Dickenson college, in a time when very few American men went to college, putting him in a favourable platform for success and was able to then apprentice at a law office (Baker, 2004).<nl>He studied law at a time where there were only three law schools in the U.S and after being admitted to the bar in 1812, opened his law practice. Soon afterward he enlisted in the military due to a War occurring in 1812 between the U.S and the UK, Ireland, and its dependent colonies and allies in North America (Baker, 2004).<nl><nl>Congressional and diplomatic career:<nl>Buchanan used to be a lawyer until he switched to politics and was successful due to his oratory skills. Buchanan successfully ran for the U.S. Place of Representatives in 1820 and turned into an ardent ally for Andrew Jackson the seventh leader of America and even coordinated volunteer supporters for Andrew Jackson who founded the new Democratic party (Smith, 1975).<nl>Moreover, in Washington, he was close with numerous Southern Congressmen and saw some New England Congressmen as concerning revolutionaries (Baker, 2004). He was delegated to the Committee of Agriculture in his first year, and he in the end became Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary and declined nomination again to a 6th term, and momentarily got back to private life (Baker, 2004). After Jackson was reappointed in 1832, he offered Buchanan the situation of United States Ambassador to Russia. Buchanan was hesitant to leave the nation at the end of the day originally agreed. He filled in as ambassador for a year and a half, during which time he learned French, which is the lingua franca of trade during the 19th century and later went on to arrange business and oceanic settlements with the Russian Empire (Baker, 2004).<nl>Kansas bleeding:<nl>‘The Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 reopened the stipulated query over state-wide slavery (Mometrix, 2021). ‘The Act drafted these new territories to expedite transcontinental railroad, the connection would bring up tension over the legality of transcontinental slavery and tension between pro-and anti-slavery activists both seeking to pass a constitution’ (Khan Academy, 2020). The faith of Kansas located in the mid-west becoming either a freed state or a slave state has reached boiling point (Mometrix, 2021). Border ruffians helped to secure a proslavery legislature in Kansas, which drafted a proslavery constitution known as the Lecompton Constitution. <nl>Meanwhile, anti-slavery activists established an extra-legal regime of their own based in Topeka. The political and ideological disputes over the Kansas- Nebraska Act opened bloodshed for 5 year and polluted the endorsers' Pierce and Douglas Democratic candidate campaign, allowing a perfect campaign run for Buchanan’ (Khan Academy, 2020). ‘Buchanan took a conventional presidential campaigning approach: making no public appearances and very few press statements, choosing to leave his campaign to his supporters named ‘Buchaneers’; Fremont did the same whereas budding Republican Lincoln campaigned heavily’ (Cooper, 2020). Nevertheless, after coming into office, Buchanan directed Kansas to be a slave state to try put an end to bleeding Kansas’ infighting (Khan Academy, 2020).<nl>Subsequently, Buchanan was given the nickname \"doughface\" by critics because he was a staunch conservative similar to Southern politicians; whilst himself being from the North. Buchanan saw that the Democratic Party's survival depended on the continuation of the slave-driven economy of the South and learned from William R. King the political importance of enabling the' peculiar institution' to continue unchecked and both were against abolitionists’ (Balcerski, 2019). After being reluctant to overrule the Southern secession in 1860 – 1861, this nickname was popularised in the country especially in the North’ (Balcerski, 2019). Unlike Fremont who wanted to outlaw slavery, Buchanan assured Americans slavery laws now and, in the future, will be determined by states independently; this catering allowed him to gain support from both South and passive North supporters (Cooper, 2020).<nl>Moreover, Buchanan became more and more dogmatic and failed to interpret the nation’, in all of his actions, Buchanan was Pro Southern and supported the Southern side, doing the same in Kansas by supporting Kansas constitute written by Southern pro settlers and not the constitution Northern pro settlers government; shocking the Northern states and politicians and constantly called Northerner's extremists and made outlandish remarks that Northerners were supporting black rapists (Cooper, 2020). <nl><nl>Dred case:<nl>Another event we could use to assess Buchanan's performance as a president was the Dred Scott Case. Buchanan supported the supreme court ruling for the ‘1857 Dred Scott case’, where an African American man tried to sue his owners on behalf of himself, his wife, and two daughters freedom; arguing that after their owners took them to \"free\" U.S territory where slavery was illegal, that they were no longer slaves, even when they went back to states where slavery was legal (Baker, 2004). Buchanan encouraged a Northerner in the supreme court to side with the South in the ‘Dred Scott case’, which essentially nationalised slavery across states where slavery was legal or illegal (Baker, 2004).  The Supreme Court ruled that the US constitution is not a constitution made to rule over African Americans and they are not citizens with rights and dismissed the case; the decision for this comes out just days after Buchanan is inaugurated (Baker, 2004). This ruling was celebrated in the South, but infuriated the North, further marginalising and alienating the North from Buchanan and Southern leaning government institutions (WH GOV, 2006). A few days later the ‘Dred case ‘ Chief clarified his ruling stating, \"Congress had no constitutional power to deprive persons of their property rights in slaves in the territories\" (Russel, 1966).<nl><nl>Buchanan Campaign:<nl>Finally, after 40 years of public service, the democratic party agrees to throw its full weight behind the 65-year-old Buchanan. Buchanan took advantage of the fact that he had been out of the country, as an ambassador in London, and so had not been involved politically in the slavery debate, meaning he did not have any strong opposition or negative public sentiment (WH GOV, 2006). Alas after 4 centuries, James Buchanan was elected to the American presidential office as the 15th president during the years 1857 – 1861, with much significance as the first native-born Pennsylvanian to serve as president and would remain the only native-born Pennsylvanian to be elected president until Joe Biden (WH GOV, 2006).<nl>Howbeit to assumptions, the Electoral College seems to show Buchanan seemingly having won with comfort; however, the truth was far from this, although Buchanan is a North native, he won in only four of fourteen Northern states and narrowly avoided loss in his native Pennsylvania. Moreover, his election run was littered with widespread suspicions, one of the most popular rumours being that the Democratic party was able to pass the narrow winning margin with fraudulent payoffs however, this is all allegations and contented (Cooper, 2020).<nl>Furthermore, as it was a three-way race, Buchanan was able to win with less than half the popular vote mandate (Cooper, 2020). In a nation sharply divided over slavery and rising sectionalism, his base support was from the South, though Buchanan could not claim anything close to a popular mandate (Cooper, 2020). Although Buchanan sought presidential office for years, he had profound concerns over this potential responsibility, stating: \"I had hoped for the nomination in 1844, again in 1848, and even in 1852, but now I would hesitate to take it. Before many years, the abolitionists will bring war upon this land. It may come during the next presidential term\" (Cooper, 2020).<nl><nl>Foreign affairs:<nl>To extend on assessing Buchanan's presidential office term, this time on his foreign relations. Buchanan was reluctant to pursue an active foreign policy because of the sectional crisis and danger of civil war in the United States (Cooper, 2020). Virtually all of his foreign policy was focused on strengthening the U.S. presence in countries to the South. \"In 1858, he told Congress, \"It is, without doubt, our race's fate to extend across the continent of North America\" (Cooper, 2020). His foreign policy remained focused on the Caribbean, an area he had dealt with while serving under Franklin Pierce as ambassador to England; as president, he did not give up on his dreams of annexing Cuba, but these ambitions were doomed by continuing Republican resistance (Cooper, 2020).  Buchanan deployed naval forces on many occasions to intimidate Britain and to curb their presence and authority in Central America and to impose American sovereignty over Central America; after a few passive threats, the British succumbed to the pressure put on them by Buchannan (Cooper, 2020). I believe as Birkner stated that Buchanan should be credited with strengthening relations with the UK, this feat was significant as Buchanan pulled this off during a period of frosty relations after the War of 1812 (National Constitution Center, 2017).<nl>Furthermore, Buchanan was seeking to create a military protectorate in Mexico to threaten and bully Latin America however, a further potential confrontation was avoided by congressional outrage and preoccupation over mainland conflict and Congressman did not approve any funding or support for any of Buchannan’s central American military wishes (Cooper, 2020). He did however get reparations from several Central and South American states over the damage they caused to American property and though the requested Mexican transit rights were denied, he did win Nicaraguans (Cooper, 2020).<nl>North and South economic slave divide:<nl>Most in the North were willing to accept slavery where it already existed, typically occurring in states that practiced extreme forms of racial oppression but would not accept the risk that slavery would expand into new areas where slavery was illegal or not present; the normalisation of slavery would gain moral public approval and might led to legal recognition into these new areas (Seidule, 2020). A lot of Southern politicians, whether or not any practical gain was involved, would not settle to give into Northern demands and indeed craved to have their demands over slavery heard; the denial of equal rights was, on the other hand, a moral rejection and a challenge to the self-esteem of a proud and sensitive person to Northerners (Seidule, 2020).<nl>Following this, many Northerners feared that the South was seeking not only to extend slavery to the west, but also to the Northern states and many Southerners feared that the first step towards complete abolition was the restriction of slavery in such remote places as Oregon and New Mexico; but both views were wrong, and an quick thinking president capable of recognising the situation and the emotions of each parties could have significantly contributed to sectional peace, instead of leaving this different in morals to brew (Smith, 2002). Buchanan's main objective was peace, but his predilections to Southern politicians whilst neglecting fellow Northerners make his dream unlikely (Seidule, 2020).<nl>The North and South had very different moral and economic model systems adopted, the South kept an agrarian economy which was strictly ‘traditional American’, 23rds of the South livelihood was on farms and plantation sites, thought the vast majority did not own slaves, whereas the North emulated Europe’s industrial revolution and was driven by employing cheap immigrant workers (Baker, 2004). Consequently, the North's main business interest was to increase tax % on European products imports, so that the other states, including the South, would buy more of their domestic products and grow the new economic system (Baker, 2004).<nl>This a huge faultline point of tension, the North thus had much more ‘Capital’ than the South, in terms of factories and infrastructure, however, the South believed their slaves to be property as a form of ‘Capital’ and not ‘Labour’; they wanted their capital to be mobile and wanted to take their slaves (wealth) across the Americas to be able to: carry their wealth across states, expand their market to trade or sell their slaves to slaveholding states and most importantly they would have more of a political constituency for the types of economic policies that would be Pro-Southern (Quist and Birkner, 2013: (American Battlefield Trust, 2020). The Southern economy was starting to stagnant and some areas were going through recessions despite this, the Northern economy was booming (American Battlefield Trust, 2020).<nl>Furthermore, in the first year of Buchannan’s presidency, there is an economic recession due to a monopoly insurance company failing, masses of business’ file for bankrupt, the economy was left volatile and would take U.S. several years to recover (Quist and Birkner, 2013). The economy was left volatile during the 1800s, as unlike today there was no federal reserve to help stabilise the economy back then and it was unrealistic to expect the federal government in the 1800s to buy its way out of a demand shortfall (Quist and Birkner, 2013).  By the time Buchannan leaves office, the population in America was just over 30 million, growing 25% during the period between 1850-1860 because of German and Irish immigrants going to work in the industrial and economic booming North (Khan Academy, 2016).<nl>Initially, due to differing political and business model interests, the North invested in railroad and roads connecting states that are at all navigable, whilst the South did not (Quist and Birkner, 2013). There were more men per capita in the South signing up to fight, but due to the huge wave of immigration in the North, they had more men who could fight, more wealth, and more resources available by the end of Buchannan’s term, which left the North with a huge advantage to win the Civil war (Smith, 1975). It is clear to see how Buchannan’s Southern close relationship escalated the sectional rivalry between the North and South after analysing the significant events in the presidency of Buchanan and the North was always expected to yield to South requests (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Presiding the Civil war, I believe Buchanan gaslighting and giving platform and legitimacy to these Southern requests to rule over the whole country, whilst blaming regional tensions solely on Northern abolitionists (Quist and Birkner, 2013). <nl>Evidently, Buchanan was given to lead over an increasingly fractured country and could not adequately grapple with the contemporised political reality of the United States; Buchanan continuance to yield to Southern demands and pleasing his Southern citizens, but Buchanan failed to contemplate that the North would not yield to these same demands and constitutions favouring Southern interests (WH GOV, 2006). He inadequately failed to also identify the rise of sectionalism and divide in American political parties, alas leading to Republicans winning every free state in the North by 1860, shunning abolitionists in society, the Whigs party collapsed, and also fragmented Democrats in the North into two parties (Smith, 1975). This lack of interest was proven during Buchannan’s inauguration where he was asked about the rising regional tensions, he said it was \"happily, a matter of but little practical importance\" since the Supreme Court could \"speedily and finally\" settle it (Histclo, 2016).<nl>Contrastingly to assumptions, Buchanan was not for any state succession and wrote a message to Congress in 1860, stating that he believes that succession is illegal, but that the federal government should not be legally allowed to stop succession if it occurs (McNamara, 2019). This ambiguous message by an influential figure was noticeably unpopular with both sides, Southerners were displeased to find out Buchanan believed secession to be illegal and Northerners were bewildered by his belief the federal government should not stop illegal succession and for the rest of his term, Buchanan retreated to his silence on any policy (McNamara, 2019).<nl>Following this, when the states, later on, made succession documents where every state voted overwhelmingly to succeed in every Southern state (Seidule, 2020); right before Buchanan officially leaves the presidency, he said to Lincoln, ‘If you are as happy my dear Sir as entering this house as I am leaving it and returning home, you are the happiest man in the country\" (Balcerski, 2019) For this case, the single most crucial reason for the War by both parties, all classes and both North and South by a long mile was slavery, a South Carolina newspaper cautioned well before the 1860 presidential election that, \"the potential abolition of slavery was a most important issue and individuals who didn’t want to \"surrender the slavery institution\" needed to take measure to defend it (Seidule, 2020).<nl>Due to ‘Bleeding Kansas’, ‘Dred Scott’, ‘Economic Recession’ and political party sectionalism by the end of his first term in 1860, it becomes increasingly evident Buchanan was not going to be a candidate for re-election (National Constitution Center, 2020). A poll in 1948 garnered interest after polling 55 reputable historians on their subjective opinion to rank the presidential performance, in addition to several newer polls such as Siena Poll 2010 and Buchanan was consistently ranked in the bottom three; historians referred to him as weak and Finkelman suggested that his lack of interest to draft policies to unite the country, showed his lack of preparedness to tackle the forecasted war (National Constitution Center, 2020).<nl><nl>Conclusion:<nl>To conclude, I believe Buchanan did try to as a president seek to preserve harmony within the government by trying to keep the country in the past, but tensions only increased after his plan to solve sectionalism and balance sides was to keep society the same (WH GOV, 2006). This however would not be interpreted as a balance and Buchannan had already been rendered irrepressible and unresponsive to resolution by his pro-Southern behaviours (Smith, 1975).<nl>Furthermore, South Carolina seceded in 1860 after Lincoln was elected to replace Buchanan, and the Confederacy was soon formed. The American Civil War (1861-1865) began a month after Buchanan left office (Cooper, 2020). Despite ‘historians and commentators of the 21st century criticising Buchanan for not addressing slavery disputes head on or critiquing him for the several states that succeed during his presidential reign and considering him as the worst American president’ (House et al., 1990). Many scholars such as Ken Stampp and Robert Johannsen say the Buchannan’s North and South segregation calamity is Buchannan’s best moment and suggested that he approached the situation in the same way that Lincoln did, but due to environmental difficulties, there was a limit to his influence (Quist and Birkner, 2013). Buchanan seems to have been a president thrown into an already fractured country, where existing issues between the free North and the slave South escalated into non-manageable levels; there were two uncompromising regions acting as two countries with two distinct cultures leaving modern-day cultural remnants.",
      "fixed_text": "Assess the performance of any President of the United States in the context of the respective period in which they held the office. Unlike many American presidents, the significance of his time in office; his character, values, convictions, and affinities combined with the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the period of his presidency, made his term of significant importance to historians and not his personality and they all agree he had a huge input in the tensions leading up to the Civil War, but historians continue to debate whether the Civil War that occurred right after his administration was inevitable or not . Buchanan seems to have been a president thrown into an already fractured country, where existing issues between the free North and the slave South escalated into non-manageable levels; there were two uncompromising regions acting as two countries with two distinct cultures leaving modern-day cultural remnants."

      "raw_text": "Employee relations is a socio-economic exchange between employer and employee with an agreement set regarding the latter’s labour power and capacity to work. (Blyton, Turnbull 2004) Employment relations examines and analyses the various dimensions of this employee-employer relationship. The impact of employee relations has a huge impact on the UK as there are approximately 32.6 million people (ONS, November 2020) employed in the country. <nl>Government as a body plays a central role in employment relations to meet the economic and social goals of the country. The Government, who help to shape and intervene with employment relations have continually formulated new regulations and laws which affect all parties of the employment relations. One of the roles Government has always held is economic manager, they are assigned to plan and manage national economic activities (Kaul, 1997) and deal with policies at both the macro and micro level, ensuring that the labour markets operates well. (Cowling, Mitchell 1997) The Government itself is an employer, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported in June 2019, there were 5.42 million people employed in the UK’s public sector, accounting for 16.5% of all those in paid work. <nl><nl>Gender equality is a worldwide issue, statistics show there have always been more men than women in the labor market. In 1971, 52.8% was the female employment rate in comparison to 92.1% of their counterpart. The gap has reduced drastically with figures from 2020 showing a female employment rate of 72.1% and a male employment rate of 78.4% (ONS), a reduction in difference of over 30%. Though the UK’s statistics have improved massively, the council of foreign relations ranked the country 7th on women’s economic participation around the world, ranking behind other western countries such as Australia and Canada. Though in the time since 1971, there has been massive developments in gender equality in the workplace, when comparing to the rest of the world we can see the UK has a lot of catching up to do to provide women the same economic opportunities as their male counterparts. This report will emphasize the UK Governments intervention on gender equality and the overall impact of this on the economy and employee relations. <nl>Introduction of new legislation by the UK in employment relations has been one of the interventions which has helped to improve the gender gap in the UK. The Equal Pay Act (1970) and the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) were revolutionary legislations which opened a door for women in the workplace; the two legislations helped the minority gender and stated that employers must ensure that there is no sex discrimination, direct or indirect. In 2002, Blair’s Labour party introduced the right to request flexible working which would facilitate both work and caring responsibilities for women. The change continued with different Governments and in 2010 the Labour Government introduced the Equality act which focused on ‘building a fairer Britain’ and brought together previous anti-discrimination laws, into one single legislation. When addressing gender quality on International women’s day, Boris Johnson stated that there is ‘so much more to do to ensure gender equality’ making us aware that the Government has and will continue to authorize different legislations to ensure that inequality is reduced from the workplace and instead, equality is made apparent. <nl><nl>Participation of women in the UK labour market is increasing year on year; though the labour market remains dominated by men, the difference in the gap between men and women has reduced. In the first quartile of 2010, there was a female employment rate of women aged 16-64 of 65.6%, whilst the male employment rate for the same quartile was 74.9%, a difference of 9.3%. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2020, ONS reported 72.6% of women were in work whilst 79.8% of males were employed, a difference of 7.2%. The difference in the gap in between employment rates has seen over a 2% decrease in the past decade, with 2020 reporting the lowest data recorded.  Women employment rate is at the highest it has ever been, despite the job loss consequences of the covid-19 pandemic which has seen many lose their job. A national survey named the Women and Employment survey, which interviewed 5588 women between the ages of 16-59 in the 1980’s produced key findings including evidence that though women returned to work after having children, it modified their lifetime earnings drastically with data showing that if a women was to have two children, it would reduce her lifetime earnings by roughly half than if she had remained childless. (Martin, Roberts 2006) In the past few decades, we have seen that working mothers are able to balance both their work and home life, and having a job provides them with stimulation, and better feelings of themselves (Poduval and Poduval 2009). Few reasons why there has been an increase of mothers in the workforce is due to the forming of new legislations and regulations by the Government including but not limited to the Shared Parental Leave 2014 and the lone parent income and support and Equality act 2010. These have helped women to feel better represented and led to positive effects on women employment and bringing in women into the workplace, allowing them to juggle their career and their families. Change in state pension age has also had an impact on the rise of women in employment; older women will stay in work for longer than previous years; for them it will provide ‘financial independence’ and an ‘opportunity to save for retirement’ (Thompson, 2020) <nl>The recession in 2008 saw both men and women being made redundant leading to an overall decrease in employment; women faired better in this decrease though due to their form of employment. Although numbers of full-time women in employment decreased, there was an incline of workers in part-time positions with employment rates in the public sector areas of education and health, where women are more heavily represented seeing a growth of 300,000 jobs between 2008 and 2009 (Rubery and Raggerty, 2013) During the recession, organisations used the method of labour market flexibility; markets responded to the changing economic conditions by making their full-time employees redundant whilst recruiting additional part-time workers to decrease working costs whilst having employees still produce the same levels of work; many women took advantage of the opportunity and so we didn’t see numbers of part-time female employment reduce. The Government permitted this labour market flexibility to continue to take the country’s market back to steadiness (Bell and Blenchflower, 2010). To help support people get back into work; the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) introduced the Future Jobs Fund (FJF) in 2009 hoping to create jobs for those disadvantaged. By 2012, we saw the economy start to improve again but in the four years before this, in such challenging times, the Government should have looked to create interventions and ways to support all those who had been affected by the recession.<nl>Though there is the issue of more men in work then women, gender pay gap is another key problem in gender inequality. In April 2019, the Office of National Statistics reported a gender pay gap of 17.4%, stating that in higher positions, there was a much larger difference in pay between the two genders compared to lower paid positions. When women enter the Labour market in low paid jobs, they are seen to rarely progress up, instead in a ‘sticky floor’ position, for men though, these jobs are seen as ‘springboards’ for them into higher paid positions. Government intervention in the form of legislations and policies help to reduce this dichotomy; the introduction of the flexible working act in 2014 and the Children and Family act (2014) meant that women could balance their families and responsibilities they have out of work. The flexible working act however stated that employees only have the right to request a change in working times after completing 26 weeks of employment. The Hampden Alexander review, supported by the Government set a minimum 33% target for women on the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 boards and the two divisions of leadership below this who would publish annual reports on gender pay gap too. Olsen et al (2018) found that women who do part time work tend to have higher quality jobs then men who work part time but that in the Labour market history, a driver for the pay gap, there was a 56% difference in the way men and women participate, 43.6% of this accounted for by the fact that men usually have a lot more experience in working full-time than women. According to equal pay act 2010, organisations had to publish six calculations including the mean and median gender pay gap in hourly pay every year (EHRC, 2020). In 2015, this voluntary reporting was made mandatory, however till today, this report publishing is not completely affective, in 2019, the equality human rights commission wrote to 47 organisations to make them aware formal investigations will begin due to their failure of reporting. Though the Law requires all organisations to report the gender pay gap, there is no requirement to reduce the pay gap, and though through the years we’ve seen gender pay gap slowly start to decrease, it is still very much apparent. The Civil Service itself, reported a gender pay gap of 11.1% in 2019, showing us that the issue is apparent, even in the public sector. The Government should have ensured that the policies they passed effected the sectors that they control and reduced completely the gender pay gap for those in such roles, this way other companies would have followed from a long time ago. <nl><nl>The Government has established a few interventions to help control gender inequality. The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1998 meant all workers would be paid a certain amount for the work they performed. The 2016 National Living Wage (NLW) added to this but specifically for those over 25; the introduction of both meant that women, who were traditionally always paid lower than men would be entitled to the same minimum wage. Personnel today predicted in 2015 that the introduction of the NLW would mean that 13 of female workers would receive a pay rise by the end of the decade due to the policy. Another intervention introduced was the establishment of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2007 (EHRC) which saw to protect people’s rights and ensure fairness and equality; the Government provides funding for the company and works with it when progressing human rights. EHRC has helped millions of people since it was started up but in 2016 saw devastating cuts to its funding, its 2007 budget of £70million was to be cut down to an estimated £18million in 2020. This lack of funding and decreased budget would have very negative consequences on gender inequality; EHRC would not be able to function as broadly as it did before, equality would not be monitored and maintained as efficiently as previous years.<nl>In the UK, the State has passed legislations and regulations in the hope to bring about gender equality. They have also established different bodies to help combat this. The equality act 2010, though one of the most important legislations to help bring about diversity and equality in the workplace, 10 years on, still sees significant gaps in employment of men and women. The gender pay gap which has been slowly decreasing, sees a higher pay gap between the two genders in more senior roles; discouraging women to try and climb up company ladders. Government should have stricter rules on closing the gender pay gap not only in lower paid roles but higher ones too, encouraging women to be ambitious in themselves. An introduction for a NLW for more vulnerable women such as single mothers should be introduced as they may struggle than most with the set NLW, better flexible working arrangements should also be made possible in all types of organisations, not just after a 26 weeks’ tenure. There should also be stricter repercussions on business’ which fail to report their gender pay gaps as a few not following guidelines could see knock-on effects on other organisations doing the same. Though the Government is doing much to fight gender inequality, as a lawmaker, manager of economy and an employer, it has a long way to go to completely diminish the issue.",

      "raw_text": "1.Outline the proposed role of dopamine in the maintenance of drug use<nl>Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward, eating, drinking and sex are examples of reward process that stimulate dopamine production. In evolutionary terms dopamine naturally encourages behaviour that is vital to live such as eating when one is hungry. The nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area are important areas in the brain associated with production of dopamine(Lecture notes). Drugs cause a rush or high- pleasurable feelings and this results in associating the drugs with the feeling. In terms of maintenance of drug use,when drugs such as cocaine are used, dopamine levels are intense and even after use dopamine levels are still high causing one to have almost a greater feeling of ‘pleasure’ leading to intense cravings and intense. This is in comparison to the levels of dopamine produced in natural activities such as eating, after eating one is basically satisfied and the dopamine levels decrease. Dopamine levels being high leads to continued use of the drug to get the ‘high’. Additionally, it's common in long term drug users that the number of dopamine receptors decrease leading to depressive feelings.(Heshmati et al, 2015). These depressive feelings would lead to increased use of the drug to achieve the pleasurable feelings, this is a cycle and the drug use is maintained. <nl><nl>2.Outline the potential role of epigenetics in explaining familial transmission of phobias<nl>Epigenetics is defined as the change in the phenotype but the genetic code stays the same. Genes are turned off or on causing changes which are heritable, this is a result of external factors eg the environment and experiences.(Hamilton J, P: Epigenetics 2011)  A study on mice who were placed in a skinner box and electrocuted showed the familial transmission of phobias, these mice were electrocuted when placed in the skinner box, as a result they formed a phobia of being placed in a skinner box, associating the electrocution (pain) with the box. The mice then produced offspring, which were placed into the skinner box without electrocution but showed a fear response. Epigenetics is the only answer as these mice had never been electrocuted and there was no reason for them to associate pain with the skinner box. Evolutionary studies have also suggested that we are born with snake and spider phobias as our ancestors were less likely to notice them, as they are small and discreet but still harmful. Our ancestors had to be more aware of them whereas lions and bears are easy to spot.(Russell et al, 2015)<nl><nl>3.<nl>Critically evaluate the evidence that schizophrenia is caused by excess dopamine in the brain<nl>The original dopamine hypothesis stated that schizophrenia was a result of excess dopamine. Evidence to support this includes the amphetamine psychosis, which is a result of taking amphetamines.(Jørgen G et al, 2012)The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis mirror symptoms of schizophrenia. The use of amphetamines also increases the amount of dopamine in the brain so for researchers this was a direct link to schizophrenia.Also, researchers found that by giving schizophrenia sufferers small doses of dopamine their symptoms worsened. The dopamine hypothesis however is biologically reductionist, there have been studies showing that there are other factors such as the environment to schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis attempts to explain schizophrenia just in terms of biology, it simplifies and generalises when the condition is much more than biology and this can be shown in the diathesis stress model. Another weakness of the dopamine hypothesis to explain schizophrenia is the correlation is not equal causation issue. There isn't sufficient evidence to show whether schizophrenia causes high dopamine levels or high dopamine levels cause schizophrenia.<nl><nl>Outline three different brain research techniques and mention one strength and one weakness for each.<nl> Fmri- functional magnetic resonance imaging. A type of imaging technique that measures blood flow in parts of the brain when participants are asked to perform tasks. One strength of this technique is that it has high spatial resolution meaning it is able to show  part exactly of the brain exactly where the blood is being used to perform tasks. FMRI tracks blood flow, as blood flow shows that a particular part of the brain is using oxygen. A weakness of this technique is that it has poor temporal resolution, brain activity can not be tracked accurately, there is a time delay of 4 to 6 seconds, this is because an FMRI scan is not able to quickly track the change in blood flow. EEG- electroencephalography is a technique where electrodes are used to measure neural activity in the brain. Temporal resolution for this technique is excellent and you can see directly the neural activity in the brain, however a weakness for EEG would be the fact it doesn't tell us anything about brain structures and the dynamics of the brain it just shows electrical potential in the brain. (Sturzbecher M.J., de Araujo D.B. (2012))The third research technique is MEG- Magnetoencephalography, it measures the magnetic field that are produced in the brain, this technique is much better in comparison to EEG in terms of spatial resolution, parts of the brain can be localised well however a massive issue is the fact that this technique is expensive and not economic that's why it is so rare.<nl><nl>2.Describe the stress response, with reference to both the neural and hormonal components<nl>The stress response is also called the fight or flight response, this is the body’s biological process to stress. This is triggered by something that could cause harm and our body is deciding to literally fight or flight, this is in order to survive.When the threat is recognised, the hypothalamus triggers the autonomous nervous system,which is rapid, and the endocrine system which is a bit slower in action. The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland which causes release of ACTH hormone, this hormone then causes the release of cortisol which is known as the stress hormone. The autonomous nervous system on the other hand works more rapidly and it causes the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline and noradrenaline and other stress hormones.(Goldstein 2010) These hormones are both useful in the state of stress for an organism. The 2 hormones increase heart rate and breathing, this is also to help with running or escaping the threat. Other physical changes happen as a result of this,pupils are dilated, rectum is contracted, there is also more blood flow to areas of the body which would be in more need such as the brain and less blood to places such as the digestive system. <nl><nl>Give an example and brief explanation of three neurodevelopmental disorders: one caused mainly by genetic factors, one mainly caused by environmental factors and one that demonstrates gene-environment interactions.<nl> Down Syndrome is mainly caused by genetic factors. Those with down syndrome normally suffer from learning difficulties. This disorder happens as a result of there being 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of just 2. A disorder mainly caused by environmental factors is  foetal alcohol syndrome, this is characterised by physical and also mental disability which is caused by brain damage to the fetus as a result of the mother’s alcohol uptake during the pregnancy. The severity depends on how much the mother was drinking and the severity of it.(Paediatr Child Health. 2002). ASD- autism spectrum disorder is a disorder which demonstrates gene-environment interaction.<nl>Outline the main structural components of the human brain, and describe 3 different examples of localisation of function within the brain.<nl><nl>6.The main structural components of the human brain are the cerebellum, cerebrum and brainstem. One example of localisation is study on Phineas Gage was involved in a traumatic accident which resulted in him losing a large part of his left frontal lobe, after his insicident his personality and mood changed massively.(LF HAAS, 2001)The left frontal lobe is associated with mood regulation and social behaviour which explained the change in phineas gage.Another example is the motor cortex, this part is associated with performing voluntary movements, damage to this area is likely to end in someone struggling to perform complicated tasks in terms of movement. One of the most famous examples for localisation of brain function is the study by Carl Wernicke.Wernicke’s aphasia is the damaged left temporal lobe, this part of the brain is associated with language, this results in the inability to produce speech that makes sense, the speech is fluent however it doesn't make any sense and there is a lack of comprehension.(Binder, 2015)",

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl>Reasoning has two explanations which have differences and similarities between them. Firstly, inductive reasoning is a process where a subject has a specific argument meaning the argument is related to true facts whereas within an inductively valid argument the conclusion is general (General Books, 2013). Therefore, the conclusion and overall argument is logically true however it may or may not be realistically true. For example, it could be said that \"all strawberries are a fruit\" (specific statement), another statement could be \"the bag is full of fruits\", (specific statement), which for inductive reasoning would lead to a general conclusion, being \"the bag is full of strawberries.\" This conclusion may or not be true as we are unsure of the contents in the bag and it could include other fruits such as grapes or apples etc. <nl>On the other hand, deductive reasoning has a different approach to arguments where instead of having a specific argument leading to a general conclusion, the subject has a general argument which isn’t really specific to the end conclusion however within the deductively valid argument the conclusion is specific, therefore it is both logically and realistically true (Jonathon and Evans, 2013). An example of this is if there was a general statement such as \"all strawberries are fruits\" and another general statement such as \"all fruits have seeds\" then the specific conclusion would be \"strawberries have seeds\". This conclusion is logically and realistically true. <nl>Furthermore, another difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is deductive reasoning problems can be resolved without real world knowledge. This is because it is argued that deduction is more likely to be deliberate and involved with rule-based practises compared to induction which is more influenced by context, which suggest that there are two alternative and distinct forms of reasoning (General Books, 2013). <nl><question2><nl>In 1996 ‘Wasons Selection task’ was developed which was based on the ruling \"if P then Q\" - if P is true then so is Q. For example, participants will be shown four cards I, K, 4,7 and be told the rule \"if a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other side.\" Participants would then be asked to turn over the minimum number of cards they think would be sufficient enough to prove the rule. However, most participants struggle with this task as they may overlook a card that could falsify the rule (Eysenck, 2004).<nl>This is because the participants have insight into the logical structure of the problem. This is based on the insight model developed in 1972 which suggested that the chances of being successful on a task depends on the participants level of insight (Eysenck, 2004). Insight has three levels, the first being no insight therefore participants will choose the cards mentioned in the rule because they think only confirming the rule is priority. In this example the participant would choose the cards \"I\" and \"4\" and could be identified as matching bias. Partial insight is the second level when the participant realises that confirming and falsifying the rule is important, therefore they would turn over \"I\", \"4\" and \"K\", the \"K\" would be falsifying. Full insight is then the highest level of insight and is when the participants will only select cards that falsify the rule, meaning the \"K\" and \"7\" card would be selected. <nl>Furthermore, it could be said that the task is so difficult due to the abstract content that is used on the participants. In conditions where concrete content is used opposed to abstract content, 60% of the participants correctly selected the P card and not the Q card (Manktelow , 1999). <nl><question3><nl>Subjective Expected utility is the theory on how to make optimal decisions. Five main axioms are used as a foundation to the theory which maximizes an individuals expected utility in decisions made. Predictions have been derived from initial axioms in order to test whether the theory can be used from psychological approach (Chavas, 2004). <nl>Transivity is the first principle where if A is preferred to B and B to C then A should be preferred to C. Nevertheless, in 1969 Tversky suggested that if decisions are complex, order preference becomes intransitive as individuals can only focus on one attribute in decision making. Invariance is the second where A is preferred to B or B to A therefore choice preference shouldn’t impact their description. However, research has proved that if they are presented with two versions of a problem its more likely that there’s a preference for A to be in version one but B to A in version two. Independence is the third principle where if A is preferred to B, it shouldn’t depend on anything the choices have in common. However, the Allais paradox states that when presented with two, individuals will prefer A to B in gamble 1 but B to A in gamble 2. Within the independence principle it states that preferences should not be affected. (Chavas, 2004).<nl>In addition, another explanation is the prospect theory which states when it is time for decision making, a person will assess their gains and losses from a decision relative to certain reference points, for example the present situation they are involved in or the way in which a decision is framed. This is done as an alternative to basing decisions on an absolute value. (Chavas, 2004)<nl><question4><nl><figure><nl>Problem solving is defined as a goal that is to be reached but an individual is not sure on how to do it. The problem in this diagram is about a student who cannot achieve higher than a C in their maths class, which is leading them to get a low outcomes, but they desire to get above a C in their overall GCSE math class. The problem that I have described above in the diagram is a well define problem which has three elements to it, being a starting state (getting lower grades than a C in math), a goal state (getting above a C) and a fixed set of operators that transforms these states (feedback and working on past papers). The method of problem solving that is being used is algorithmic procedures which means that there is a solution to the problem however the downfall is it may be a very slow process to get to the end goal. Within this diagram it displays simple steps to get to the end goals such as working on past papers and gaining feedback, however this may take a long time depending on the individual. For example, if their working at grade is a D it may take less time and they could be at a C within 3 week. Nevertheless, there is a definite solution solutions to the problem.<nl>Evidently this state action tree is using a heuristic search method, more specifically the hill climbing technique which means to always choose the move that will get you closer to the goal state (Manktelow, 1999). Within my diagram above every step that is taken, whether that is feedback or past papers, it will bring the student closer to its goal state of getting above a C in math. <nl><question5><nl>Creativity is defined as an insightful or unusual solution which is valuable (Pope, 2005). A solution that is creativity must be valuable and useful in one way or another and has to be understood and noticed by society. There are four main perspectives that could be used to discover more about creativity, which is based on studying creative people, the creative process, the creative product of the environment of creativity. <nl>It was said that creativity can be assessed using the psychometric approach which Guilford in 1956 distinguished into two ways of thinking. Convergent thinking is when the individual converges the correct answer and the best answer to a problem. Whereas the other type of thinking that Guilford suggested was divergent thinking which is when the individual develops many different solutions to the same problem, and this requires more flexibility, wider thinking and originality. Divergent thinking was considered a form of creativity which Guilford attempted to conceptualize, however an issue with this was that these tests can often confuse creativity and intelligence or creativity and originality therefore it may be hard to distinguish. <nl>Furthermore, another way that creativity can be assessed is the biographic and autographic approach where Wallas in 1926 identified four stages of creative process. First being preparation which is when background knowledge is absorbed, also incubation which is when the problem is dismissed for any reason. Wallas also said that inspiration was art of the creative process which is when the solution is developed for the first time. Lastly, verification is part of the creative process when the individual confirms whether the solution was successful or not. These stages were proved with evidence regarding the assessment of creativity, however with the exclusion of incubation. The incubation period has still remained controversial regarding the creativity process.",

Thank you . Hello, I would like to take part in the module module. Thank you, . Okay, I have done that, I was just unsure as others did something different. Thank you Hello Carmelita, I would like to book an appointment for someone to look over my CV for the assessment but I do not know where to do this. Could you assist me with this please? Thank you ., 2nd year course student Hello, I would like to book an appointment for someone to look over my CV online for the assessment but I do not know where to do this.

      "raw_text": "1. Compare and contrast deductive and inductive reasoning. Use examples to explain. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning involves logical thinking, providing us with the means to determine valid arguments in one’s train of thought. Similarly, inductive reasoning is a way of increasing semantic information through generalisation, allowing us to come to conclusions about whether a statement is true or false. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that concrete or previously known knowledge affects performance on experimental tasks measuring components of ordinary language. For example, in deductive reasoning, our own beliefs effect the validity of conclusions we make because our world knowledge clouds our judgement. Wilkins, (1928) found participants’ beliefs caused conflict with the validity of syllogisms and as a result, their judgement was poorer. Beliefs effect the interpretation of premises, influencing reasoning and bringing about response bias, therefore affecting the validity of the conclusion made. Similarly, experiments on inductive reasoning show familiar content can remind a person of similar problems they solved in the past. Griggs &amp; Cox, (1982) called this the ‘Memory Cueing Hypothesis’ – individuals retrieve similar contexts or situations involving solving a similar problem from their long-term memory, reducing facilitation effects involved in reasoning. <nl><nl>Another distinction between these types of reasoning is the certainty involved in making conclusions. In inductive reasoning, there is no certainty that the conclusion made from premises are valid all the time, as validity of conclusions depends on factors such as premises given, intention of the argument or statement, as well as the amount of information available at the time. Contrastingly, deductive reasoning is not dependent on as many variables, and is much more clear-cut and direct. Deductive reasoning allows us to form completely valid conclusions all the time, due to logical systems this type of reasoning follows, such as formulisation. Therefore, the conclusion will follow from the premises with absolute certainty, unlike inductive reasoning.<nl><nl>2. Why do we find Wason’s selection task so difficult? <nl>Peter Wason’s selection task is a logic puzzle involving deductive reasoning, heavily influenced by Popper’s hypotheticodeductive method. Participants are presented with four cards and a simple rule, and are asked which cards they need to turn over to see if the rule has been broken. Performance in this task is only 15%, even if participants are asked to falsify the rule, not prove it right. Research suggests concrete content facilitates performance. Cheng &amp; Holyoak (1985) state that humans reason with context-dependent ‘pragmatic reasoning schemas’, involving knowledge about permissions, obligations and causations. These schemas function to predict and reason in unfamiliar situations. During the selection task, permission schemas are evoked along with a set of rules with familiar information in a given scenario. The corresponding schema matches information required to solve the task, and so permission schema facilitate performance, especially when concrete rather than abstract content is used. <nl><nl>Additionally, Wason’s selection task is found difficult when rules cannot be interpreted as a social contract. Cosmides, (1989) found the selection task is facilitated when involving social exchanges derived from his computational theory, specifically tasks requiring the participant to detect a ‘cheater’ trying to take the benefit without paying the cost of a contract. In the context of the selection task, the participant is detecting a ‘if P not Q’ card is exposing the cheat. Cheat detection is parallel with familiar realistic situations involving social interaction rather than ambiguous and context-free content. When a selection task uses abstract terms not involving social exchanges, participants find it harder to reason as the situation is unfamiliar and doesn’t entail benefits or losses. This highlights the importance of context in Wason’s selection task – when context is not given, performance decreases considerably.<nl><nl>3. What are the predictions of \"Subjective Expected Utility\" theory for human decision making. How have deviations been explained? <nl><nl>Subjective expected utility theory (SEU), (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 &amp; Savage, 1954) describes decision making, stating when individuals make decisions, they will act rationally by trying to maximise their expected utility. SEU aims to simplify decision making via 5 axioms (completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence and ranking), which when considered, will maximise expected utility. <nl><nl>The transitivity axiom assumes people make choices transitively – if they prefer A to B and B to C, they should prefer A to C. Tversky, (1969) identified a deviation in this axiom, called ‘intransitivity of preferences’, stating that humans are, in reality, inconsistent in their preferences of choices due to individual differences in evaluative processes and because preferences vary temporally. Tversky conducted experiments using classic transitive preference scenarios and found participants’ preference ordering was inconsistent to the transitivity axiom. Classic scenarios are not logically compatible with the rationality of human decision making, because variability and individuality of decision making in realistic situations aren’t taken into consideration.<nl><nl>The independence axiom states preference of order between two choices with equal outcomes should not be affected by one another, even when a third gamble is involved. In other words, equal outcomes should cancel each-other out. A deviation in this axiom called the ‘Allais paradox’ (Allais, 1953), states the independence axiom fails to consider feelings like disappointment, as well as the rationality involved in choosing a gamble and potentially getting nothing from it. The Allais paradox states evaluations of gambles cannot be done independently of other gambles, as the independence axiom assumes. <nl><nl>These deviations highlight the importance for a newer theory to recognise the influence of rationality, and which involves a psychologically descriptive approach, for example the ‘multi-attribute utility theory’ which is more able to explain decision making in realistic scenarios where decisions are dependent on many independent variables.<nl><nl>4. Using a specific puzzle or problem of your own choice, write out a plan (including diagram) of how to solve it using a state-action tree. <nl><nl>This problem is the ‘Chicken River Crossing Puzzle’: A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. The task is to find out how the man gets all 3 things to the other side of the river in one piece. <nl><nl>The solution to this puzzle is as follows: first, the chicken crosses the river in the boat, and the fox and corn are safe together on the other side. He goes back across, and then takes the fox across the river replacing it with the chicken, which is now on the other side. Since the chicken and corn cannot be left together, he takes the corn in his boat and switches the chicken for the corn, which he takes across and leaves it with the fox. He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time, where all his items are across the river safely.<nl><figure><nl><nl>5. What is \"creativity\" and how can it be assessed?  <nl><nl>Creativity is defined as one’s ability to generate innovative ideas and solutions, and is seen as a form of intelligence. Creative solutions are seen as valuable and insightful, often solutions that novice individuals may not have come up with themselves; in this regard, creative individuals are seen as experts in their domain, as they hold extensive knowledge giving them the ability to produce innovative and original solutions commonly acknowledged by wider society. <nl><nl>Various perspectives aim to assess creativity differently, for example the psychometric approach aims to objectively measure creativity. Creativity has been conceptualised as a form of divergent thinking by Guilford, (1956), which is a style of thinking that can lead to many possible solutions to the same problem. It requires both originality and flexibility. Psychometric tests of creativity include the ‘Unusual Uses Task’ by Guilford, (1967): the participant’s task is to create alternative uses for a common object. Four dimensions are used to score answers: flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration. Participant’s demonstrate divergent thinking if they generate unusual yet valuable uses for the object. The ‘Remote Associates Test’ (RAT) was created by Mednick, (1962), who theorised that creativity involves associating nonidentical concepts which are considered dissimilar. In RATs, respondents are shown stimuli in the form of three words and are asked to identify a word to link them together, for example \"worm  shelf  end\". Here, the answer is book (book worm, book shelf, book end). Psychometric tests in assessing creativity have produced interesting results, especially the observed link between creativity and intelligence, however these methods often mix creativity and intelligence, or originality and creativity. That is, creative individuals tend to have high IQ, but not all high IQ individuals are creative, consequently decreasing the validity of psychometric tests claiming to assess creativity.",

      "raw_text": "Abstract:<nl>A prevalent association has been found between conscientiousness and favourable eating behaviour. Costa &amp; McRae (1992) define individuals high in conscientiousness as careful and self-disciplined. These characteristics are advantageous towards diet control and avoiding unhealthy eating. Another association exists between neuroticism and unfavourable eating behaviour (UEB): individuals high in neuroticism lack self-control and are vulnerable to unhealthy eating and disordered eating. This study used a questionnaire to measure the relationship between eating behaviour and personality type. Using correlational analysis, associations were found between unhealthy eating and personality traits, specifically conscientiousness being significantly negatively correlated with UEB and a predictor for UEB.<nl>Introduction:<nl>The World Health Organisation (2020) found that worldwide prevalence of obesity almost tripled between 1975 – 2016. Amongst others, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases have been linked to psychological mechanisms. Namely, personality, acting as a risk factor for unfavourable eating behaviour (UEB), such as consumption of convenience junk food and sugary foods, all playing a role in increasing likelihood of illness. Costa &amp; McRae, (1992) aimed to represent human personality via the Big-Five Model comprising neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness (OCEAN). Typically, an individual high in neuroticism exhibits emotional instability, moodiness and anxiety, placing them at high vulnerability for UEB including emotional eating and binge-eating. By contrast, an individual high in conscientiousness has good impulse control, goal-directed behaviours, restrained eating behaviours and dietary moderation. Keller &amp; Siegrist, (2015) assessed the connection between personality and UEB using the Big-Five Model and found conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on consumption of food categories indicative of an unbalanced diet, such as fatty and sugary foods, whereas high neuroticism had a significant positive indirect effect on consumption of unhealthy food groups, making conscientiousness and neuroticism likely predictors of the food choices an individual makes. Personality type may predispose individuals to developing obesity and disease; investigating this association between personality and UEB is important, and is useful in indicating vulnerable individuals to introduce preventative methods in order to reduce disease and obesity in the population.<nl><nl>The following study used items from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Hartmann et al., 2012) and the Big-Five Inventory scale (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) to create a questionnaire which measured participants’ eating behaviours and personality types. It was hypothesized personality would be associated with FFQ score, specifically neuroticism would be positively correlated with FFQ score, and conscientiousness would be negatively correlated with FFQ score and act as a predictor of UEB.<nl><nl>Methods:<nl>Participants:<nl>195 participants, male (n= 135) and female (n= 60), aged 15 – 73 years old. A chain-referral sampling technique was used: participants completed the questionnaire, then recruited further participants to complete the questionnaire. <nl><nl>Design: <nl>Correlational design measuring the relationship between FFQ score and personality, the predictor variables being OCEAN traits.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>Big Five Inventory (BFI):<nl>Measured personality traits: included 44 items grouped onto 5 subscales (OCEAN traits). Items were measured on a Likert scale 1-5 (see Appendix A for item scales). Negatively worded items were reverse coded: where participants marked their answer as 1, this was reverse coded to 5, 2 to 4, and so on. This was done to ensure reliability and validity by producing accurate responses. <nl><nl>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ):<nl>Estimated habitual consumption frequency of various food products and snacks: included 17 items and 6 subscales (4 were included in analysis: sweets and savouries, sugar sweetened-beverages, convenience food and meat). Items regarding sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption frequency were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale 0-14: 14 = ‘several times a day’, 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 =, ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’. Convenience food consumption was assessed on a 5- point Likert scale 0-7: 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 = ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’ (see Appendix B for food groups and items). <nl><nl>Procedure: <nl>A questionnaire was created using items from the BFI the FFQ, and sent to participants via an online website. Participants were reminded their data was anonymous and informed consent was obtained. Once questionnaire responses were gathered, participants were debriefed and a raw data set was retrieved. Scores were calculated from the BFI as mean score by reverse coding, totalling scores from each trait and dividing them by number of items for a given trait, giving five mean scores. FFQ scores were calculated as total score by summing values of the 4 relevant subscales, giving a total of 0-182. Scores from the questionnaire as well as demographic data were exported to jamovi (The jamovi project, 2021) for analysis. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows agreeableness had the highest mean of the OCEAN traits (M = 3.68), and neuroticism had the lowest mean (M = 3.21). Table 2 shows results of the Pearson correlation, indicating there was a significant negative association between conscientiousness and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.168, p = .019), and a significant negative association between age and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.243, p = &lt;.001). There was a positive significant association between conscientiousness and agreeableness, (r (195) = .275, p = .004), and a positive association between conscientiousness and extraversion, (r (195) = .147, p = .041). Table 3 shows results of the multiple linear regression, indicating there was an overall significant effect between FFQ score and OCEAN traits, (F (7, 187) = 2.68, p &lt; .011, R2 = .091). Examining individual personality covariates indicated that conscientiousness (t = -2.029, p = .044) was a significant predictor in the model.  <nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Conscientiousness was significantly negatively correlated with FFQ score, meaning as participants scored high on conscientiousness, they scored lower for UEB. Conscientiousness was found to be a significant predictor of FFQ score; these findings support the hypothesis and align with Costa &amp; McRae’s, (1992) findings that conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on UEB. A well-established characteristic of conscientiousness is self-control, or in a psychological context, inhibitory control, described by Dyer, (2017) as the \"ability to supress one response in favour of a goal- directed response\" and that it \"plays an important role in emotional regulation\", particularly in prefrontal and cingulate cortex brain regions. Conscientious individuals are careful with their food behaviours and less likely to make poor food choices impulsively because they have better inhibitory control than say, individuals high in neuroticism. Being goal-driven and good at adhering to diets or weight-loss goals may explain why conscientiousness was negatively associated with favourable eating behaviours, like restriction of savoury foods and snacks; perhaps conscientiousness serves as a prevention of obesity and disease. <nl><nl>Agreeableness and extraversion were significantly positively correlated with conscientiousness. Individuals high in these traits are sociable, creative and emotionally stable. It is logical characteristics of conscientiousness correlate with those of agreeableness and openness, explaining why these traits were significantly correlated with one-another. Keller and Seigrist, (2015) found agreeableness was significantly negatively associated with sweetened drinks and meat consumption, and openness was significantly positively correlated with intake of fruits and vegetables. Thus, like conscientiousness, individuals high in agreeableness and extraversion are more likely to partake in healthy eating behaviours.<nl><nl>Interestingly, neuroticism was not significant, highlighting potential issues with the questionnaire’s validity, specifically whether items claiming to measure neuroticism were actually doing so. Moreover, the Five-Factor Model is limited – OCEAN traits are broad descriptions, rather than explanations of the ‘why’ or ‘how’s’ of personality. Categorisation of OCEAN traits ignore individual differences and the complexity of human personality. Consequently, can OCEAN traits be satisfactorily used to derive causalities between personality type and eating behaviour? Bogg &amp; Roberts, (2004) defend the need for a meta-analytic approach when examining personality and eating behaviour; by collating studies from diverse areas of research, causalities found between personality type and eating behaviour are considerably more valid, increasing generalisability of relationships established.",
