      "raw_text": "Regarding the information I have gathered for the CEO's trip to Helsinki, I have managed to find a multitude of things ranging from hotels to souvenir shops for her children. To start of with, the hotel I thought would be the best fit is the Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel, due to the fact it overlooks the scenic Gulf of Finland. The hotel further has access to gyms, saunas and serves traditional and fresh food, only for Â£74 pn. It is only 1.8 miles from the centre. The next place I found for the CEO to have breakfast was Karl Fazer CafÃ©, where they serve cinnamon buns and all sorts of savoury foods. It is local to the Hotel, being a 7 minute walk or a 5 minute car ride. Next, when looking at museums to explore, 2 stood out. One being, Sea Fortress Suomenlina. This stood out as it is near water, which is what Helsinki is known for, the sea, diverse architecture and their word famous designs. This sightseeing should be around 2-3 hours, and has many castles to visit including historical castles. The second was the Island and Open Air museum, this is more outdoor and is populated by many restaurants. This museum has been described as 'breath-taking', which is why it is also one that stood out. In regards to the souvenir shop, Kankufin Tapa was the highest rated one. This was because of the small homemade souvenirs, which can be easily to transport from different countries. For entertainment purposes, G-Livelab is the best place to go for live music, and for jazz. There is an event happening on the 4th September. Lastly, in relation to food, the restaurant that was highly rated was Kanstan Moljo. Though this is a buffet, it was highly rated because you can try a variety of traditional foods without having to commit to a whole meal. Additionally, it one of the few places that didn't serve solely salmon, there was alternatives such as reindeer meat, moose meat as well pork stew. These will allow for the CEO to not feel as though she is only faced with one option and that being seafood.",

I’m awfully worried because I did submit it, I kept the original document which shows the time and date the document was last modified and I don’t mind retaking the exam itself in November again but I’m really hoping that I’m not made to retake the entire year again. I hope I’m not being dramatic but I am very anxious as 2 of my exams earlier this year didn’t go amazingly well either and I just need to know if anything can be done regarding this situation.

Thank you Kind Regards, . Hi Tony, Thank you and I hope all is well with yourself too! These timings will be difficult for me, is there any dates or timings you have available from mid to late September? Kind Regards, . Good morning Adora, Yes that will be great. Kind Regards, ."

      "raw_text": "Alpha oscillatory activity (8-13 Hz) is the dominant EEG rhythm in the awake brain. Initially thought to reflect cortical idling (Pfurtscheller, Stancák, &amp; Neuper, 1996), the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) suggests that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task-irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch, Sauseng, &amp; Hanslmayr, 2007). Supporting this, visual spatial attention tasks found a robust cortical response: when attention was directed to one hemifield via a directional cue, alpha decreased in the contralateral hemisphere (Sauseng, et al., 2005; Thut, Nietzel, Brandt., &amp; Pascual-Leone, 2006) and increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Worden, Foxe, Wang, &amp; Simpson, 2000; Kelly, Lalor, Reilly, &amp; Foxe, 2006), suggesting alpha oscillations were supressed in brain areas involved in active processing. Thus, alpha oscillations have emerged as an indicator of sensory supression and are proposed to play a pivatol, mechanistic role in attention by gating information flow to relevant sensory regions (Mazaheri, et al., 2014).<nl>The present study specifically analysed the effect of arrow cues proceeding stimulus onset on alpha oscillations. It is a partial replication of Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, in which they found that alpha range amplitudes were lower in parietal areas involved in active processing 200ms before stimulus onset. In line with this, the hypothesis for this study predicts that when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe, there will be higher alpha range amplitudes for the cue left than the cue right condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>Thirty-nine undergraduate students volunteered to participate in the study after providing informed consent. One participant was not included in the analysis due to incomplete data.<nl>Design<nl>A within-subjects design was used. The independent variable was cue direction (with two levels: left and right). The dependent variable was alpha range amplitudes within the left parietal lobe in microvolts (𝜇V).<nl>Materials<nl>The EEG alpha range activity was measured using BIOPAC MP36 and 3 electrodes. AC and Everi cream were used to apply electrodes. PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker. The cues included left and right arrows (as shown in figures 1a and 1b), which informed participants which hemifield to expect the stimulus. The stimuli included small and large white bars (as shown in figures 1c and 1d). <nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>EEG alpha range activity was recorded from 3 electrodes located at the sites of the standard 10-20 system (Trans Cranial Technologies, 2012). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz and a notch filter at 50 Hz was applied. The active electrode was attached to P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz and the earth was attached to the forehead near the hairline. These were measured relative to Cz. Electrode impedance was kept at &lt;10 kΩ.<nl>Participants were asked to perform a cued visual attention task. Figure 2 illustrates a typical trial sequence and time course of events. Each participant sat on a chair in front of a computer screen and completed a consent form. Then, the experimenter applied electrodes on the participant’s scalp and gave them task instructions. Participants were told that a cue would appear to indicate which side of the screen to expect a stimulus, followed by a brief pause where they would attend to a central fixation cross. Then, a small or large bar stimulus would appear, and they would respond accordingly using the keyboard. Each participant performed 12 practice trials with feedback (3 blocks of 4 trials) to familiarise themselves with the task, followed by 80 experimental trials without feedback (20 blocks of 4 trials). Trial types (cue right small bar, cue right large bar, cue left small bar, cue left large bar) were randomised within each block. Each trial began with a central fixation cross presented on the screen for 800ms. An arrow cue, which pointed either left or right, was briefly presented for 35ms. The direction of the arrow indicates which visual hemifield the target stimulus would appear. After a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between 200ms and 1200ms (800ms for practice trials), a target stimulus was presented for 50ms. A random ISI prevented participants from anticipating exactly when each stimulus would appear. Then, an event marker was sent at stimulus onset. Different markers were sent for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli were either small or large white bars, presented on a black background. Participants responded by pressing the ‘L’ key if the bar was large and the ‘S’ key if the bar was small. Finally, the experimenter removed the electrodes and debriefed participants.<nl><figure><nl>Results<nl>Data treatment<nl>Event markers were sent from PsychoPy to Biopac to identify when stimuli were presented. The period 200ms before stimulus onset, after arrow cues had been shown, was analysed for cue left and cue right conditions. The raw alpha data was rectified to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. Rectifying converted all negative values to positive, to get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Then, the data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of outlying values and smooth the data. The transformed data will be known as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl>Data analysis<nl><table><nl>The normality of data was assessed. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the cue left (W = .83, n = 38, p &lt; .001) and cue right (W = .85, n = 38, p &lt; .001) conditions were significant. Therefore, the data was not normally distributed, and non-parametric statistics were used.<nl>Table 1 shows that median RAAA were .02 higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. A Wilcoxon signed-rank rest indicated that this difference was statistically significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .002).<nl>Discussion<nl>The results of the present study support the hypothesis that there is significantly higher alpha amplitudes for cue left than cue right conditions when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe. These results are consistent with the AIH, as alpha activity was higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention (Worden, et al., 2000; Kelly, et al., 2006) which indicates supression and disengagment of the task-irrelevant hemisphere (Klimesch, et al., 2007). Furthmore, these results are consistent with Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) experiment, because from -200ms to stimulus presentation, there was stronger alpha suppression contralateral to the cued hemifield. Hence, the findings highlight the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and their crucial role in gating attention through the inhibition of irrelevant information (Mazaheri, et al., 2014).<nl>Although the results clearly support the hypothesis, it is appropriate to recognise potential limitations. A first limitation concerns the distractive environment the experiment was conducted in. There were multiple groups working simultaneously in a lab on campus. Typical distractions included students chattering, experimenters speaking loudly and ongoing lectures. It is possible that these distracted and averted the visual attention of participants away from the task (Hughes, 2014). Therefore, future researchers must ensure that the study is conducted in a silent, non-distractive environment. <nl>Another limitation is that the present results cannot be generalised to the wider population. Studies found that cue-induced alpha lateralization was observed in younger, but not older adults (Hong, Sun, Bengson, Mangun, &amp; Tong, 2015). This suggests that younger and older adults may engage in different neural mechanisms of attentional orienting, and that the AIH is a phenomenon that diminishes through aging. Thus, further research must be conducted using a large, diverse sample of participants.<nl>Despite these limitations, one application of the present study is that individuals can be trained to enhance the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations. Kerr, et al., (2011) found that mindfulness meditation enhanced cue-induced alpha modulation. By improving people’s ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information, they can be more effectively focus their attention. <nl>To conclude, the present research replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings and contributes to a growing body of evidence to suggest that alpha range activity is supressed in areas of visual cortex involved in active processing. Despite limitations, the data are valid as they are consistent with previous research and theory. Therefore, the study provides clear support for the AIH being a robust cortical response.",
