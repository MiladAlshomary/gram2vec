      "raw_text": "This essay will look to answer the question above, ‘To what extent does sport foster and reproduce a hyper-consumerist culture?’. Hyper-consumerism refers to ‘the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods, exerted by modern capitalist society, as those goods shape one’s identity’ (Wikipedia, 2020), in simpler forms, ‘a consumerism for the sake of consuming’ (Lunning, F., 2014). There are a number of ways that the theory of hyper-consumerism can be applied to the subject of sport and sports relation to hyper-consumerism. However, there are a number of ways that sport can be considered as not fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism and instead an area affected by hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>There are a number of highly popular professional sports that over the last 3 decades have seen the change of consumerism within the professional sport. Hyper-consumerism in a number of professional sports. One professional sport where there has been an abundance of growth in consumerism and profitability is professional football. The Premier League teams of England are projected to pull in £5.4bn in the 202021 season (Deloitte, 2020). With £1.35bn (25%) of this coming from commercial business for the Premier League clubs. The Premier League generates the most revenue out of all the top 5 European football leagues by roughly £1.5bn over the closest league, Spain at £3.38bn. The scale of these figures show the high expenditure within football leagues but especially the Premier League. It also shows the size of the commercial brands of the Premier League teams. Specifically the annual revenue of the big 6 Premier League teams totalling £4.13bn (Sports Pro Media, 2020). This revenue causes high expenditure on transfers and wages for players. This lavish spending fosters a lifestyle that is presented to fans and these fans want to be a part of whether its buying a jersey of the team they support or buying a season ticket to watch their team every weekend. These actions are a perfect example of hyper-consumerism culture with these goods being non-functional and possess a significant pressure in the supporters life and take control of their lives when the games are being played. <nl><nl>Although hyper-consumerism does play a role within sports, as presented above, however, is the growth of revenues within football fostered by hyper-consumerism not the other way round? Hyper-consumerism is a theory that has been around longer than the growth in revenues for sports with its close association with globalisation and cultural homogenisation (McGregor, S., 2007). With this considered if there was a lack of globalisation and cultural homogenisation would we see the high revenue of the top global sporting leagues such as  the NFL, NBA, MLB and the Premier League, which all are valued between £5bn and £11bn (AP Sports Editor, 2020). Without the human nature of greed that causes hyper-consumerism would we instead see these leagues having significantly lower revenue. This is just one factor that could suggest in my opinion that hyper-consumerism fosters sports and the growth of sports. It can also be considered that hyper-consumerism and sports are actually symbiotic, in which they work in a close relationship as one grows the other grows and vice-versa. <nl> <nl>Another factor that supports the idea of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism is that of the growing expenditure of households on sports. According to a study by Sheffield Hallam University, the average household expenditure on sports in 2002 was £11.38, however, as of 2018 the average household expenditure on sports was £76.80 (Gov.uk, 2019).  This is a 674% increase in expenditure over 16 years or 42% per year. This tremendous growth in expenditure is similar to the growth in revenue of the most popular UK sporting league, the Premier League, which over 16 years saw its revenues grow from £1.25bn (Deloitte, 2003) to £5.4bn, a growth of 432% or 27% . This shows as a professional sport league grows so does the expenditure by a household. Thus showing evidence of how sport can reproduce and foster a hyper-consumerism culture which is clearly evident in the UK. This culture has significantly grown in the UK over the last two decades and I will look at further into this essay. <nl><nl>Although there is evidence of hyper-consumerism having a relationship to sport, there is also evidence of hyper-consumerism being caused by the growth of technology. A prime example of this is the hyper-consumerism of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has seen a growth of hyper-consumerism with the growth of technology within the country’s economy (Kazim, A., 2018). With an abundance of mega malls and the growth of internet shopping the culture in UAE over the last 50 years has transferred from traditional markets to a hyper-consumer culture of luxury global brands. The growth in this culture in the UAE is seen further with the growth of the country’s GDP per capita which, as of 2019, totaled $69,900 (Societe Generale, 2019). This is a stark contrast to 1975 when the GDP per capita was at $26,847 (World Bank, 2019). These statistics suggest a substantial growth in the economy which has come with a growth in consumerism. This suggests the theory that the main cause of hyper-consumerism is the growth of an economy. Further evidence of this is the lack of sport participation in the UAE this hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. Reinforcing that instead of the sports being played fostering hyper-consumerism instead its the growth of globalisation and technology fostering hyper-consumerism. Ultimately, this shows that hyper-consumerism can exist without a large presence of sport within the economy. <nl><nl>This hyper-consumerist culture that has been seen in the United Arab Emirates is prominently the whole world over. However, there is clear and specific sport  that can be given as evidence for fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. One such sport is basketball and specifically the NBA (National Basketball Association). A prime example within the sport is the Air Jordan brand, owned by Nike and named after the critically acclaimed greatest player of all time, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan brand, launched in 1984, in 2019, had revenues totalling $3.1 billion which made up 8% of Nike’s revenues in the same year (Forbes, 2020). This along with the revenue of the NBA itself of $8.4 billion shows the massively consumer nature of the NBA in the US (ESPN, 2020). Within the NBA the most popular consumer good is team jerseys, the average price of these is $110, approx. £81 (The Street, 2020). This high priced consumer good along with the cost of attending an NBA game of roughly $89. This fits perfectly the nature of goods that are typical of a hyper-consumerist culture described in the introduction. These goods are not something that is functional but people want and purchase for their lives to fit in with the culture. <nl><nl>Hyper-consumerism is caused by a number of economic factors and the sports economic growth is instead down to the existence of hyper-consumerism. An economic factor is globalisation, with the growing number of accessible non-functional goods hyper-consumerism has become a causal byproduct. This can be seen in sports as seen above with the English Premier League growing to revenues of £5.4bn in 2020. With the league being watched globally in 188 of 193 countries (Premier League, 2019). Without globalisation there would not be abundant accessibility of sports to consumers. With the growth of commercial sports media on the internet in places such as Youtube, with 79% of users watching sports on the platform (Youtube, 2020). Globalisation of markets has caused  hyper-consumerism and greater accessibility to sports that would not be possible without globalisation. . <nl><nl>Previously I have discussed the growing sporting culture and spectator sports in the UK and its role in fostering hyperconsumerism. This is an area that has seen significant growth and can be used as evidence. On the subject of spectator sports, on average in the UK expenditure by spectators is £54 per person (not including ticket price) (Sports England, 2019). This shows sports fostering hyper-consumerism as when attending these events spectators are spending money for non-functional purposes. Furthermore, the UK sporting goods market is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Ibis World, 2020) . Largely caused by the increase of people exercising during the national lockdowns ordered by the UK Government. This being reinforced by the statistics, from Sport England, that 63% of people saying that they exercise over 3 days a week in the first National Lockdown. This shows that even in a time of economic negativity with the UK economy shrinking by 3.4% (PWC, 2020) there was still significant consumer spending on sport showing the level of consumers wants and needs to spend on the non-functional goods or services. This growth in the market even in the pandemic is far greater than other non-functional goods in this time and show the nature of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>Throughout this essay I have compared aspects in which that sport both does foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism but also doesn’t. The aspects that sport shows to foster and reproduce is through the growth of popular leagues such as the English Premier League and these top leagues promoting a lifestyle, the growing of UK household expenditure on watching professional sports, sporting good brands promoted through professional sports such as the NBA and the Air Jordan brand, expenditure on attending spectator sports and purchases at these events. All these aspects promote a clear message that sports play a role in hyper-consumerism at the bare minimum. Whether sport ‘fosters and reproduces’ hyper-consumerism is highly contestable. Shown by the evidence presented hyper-consumerism can exist and grow without an overarching presence of sport, as seen with the UAE in which the average GDP per capita has grown from $26,847 in 1975 to $69,900 in 2019. This staggering growth in GDP per capita has caused a growth in the consumerist culture which is highly focused on luxury consumer brands. This hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. In conclusion, I think that, firstly, sport can foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism. However, I believe that hyper-consumerism does not need sports to grow as shown with the case of the United Arab Emirates, although this is a rarity and to fully determine how common of an occurrence this can be further research needs to be done. Finally, although sport does foster hyper-consumerism it is only possible with globalisation and instead globalisation is the major foster and reproducer of hyper-consumerism and sports is an area that is consumed by the hyper-consumerist culture we have.

      "raw_text": "<question1><nl><nl>The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one’s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted ‘U’ shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galván, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob’s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents’ susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain’s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents’ vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual’s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC’s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).",

As this piece progresses, opinions of scholars who propose unique and interesting alternatives will be analysed with the final position being that Birks’ does not wholly present a modern perspective on such a diverse definition. <nl><nl>Outdated approach<nl>Perhaps to consider the role of conscience within legal disputes, one should turn to their private intuition. However, to venture into this ‘uncertain terrain’, by adopting a narrow approach, the courts are reversing the trends of equity. Birk’s reliance upon private intuition directly contradicts legal decision-making and therefore, for judges to rely on their intuitive conscience gives rise to additional subjectivity and seriously harms the rule of law. Nonetheless, it raises the concern as to why this indefinable concept of unconscionability should be accepted. Maxwell states that this terminology conflicts with values of certainty; the law must facilitate prediction rather than accept terms which are heavily subjective and uncertain. <nl><nl>Additionally, though conscience can be criticized for its ‘judicial moral subjectivism’, when judges make these decisions, they are essentially moral and based on ‘normative practices (…) that already exist in society and outside the law’. Therefore, this private intuition is really the perception individuals have when interpreting external standards of morality and Dworkin asserts that judges interpret this morality by presupposing laws of the community. Instead, the flawed doctrine of Equity gives rise to scepticism as opposed to conscience itself. <nl><nl>Conscience, subjectivity &amp; The Rule of Law <nl>To understand conscience, it is vital to consider opinions of scholars when assessing the truth in Birks’ statement. Perhaps looking at the rule of law can provide better clarification. Harding suggests that there must be a ‘counterbalance’ for the continued use of unconscionability because society can lose respect for the law if legal rules are not strictly applied in situations where exploitation of unjust outcomes are used for personal gain. Though conscience is ‘expressive’, it remains impossible to anticipate eventuality, therefore, mechanisms must be established to protect formal rules from being opportunistically exploited. Equity serves as this very mechanism by supplementing common law and the adjustment of rules adhering to extra-legal standards. Here, different observations of equity are presented and Birks’ reliance on intuition seems questionable. <nl><nl>When observing conscience in equity, formal rules have been altered to make perfect moral sense. In common law and equitable liabilities, the courts consider ‘moral clarity’ rather than blindly following law. There is an evaluative aspect here where subjective interpretation is necessary to encourage ‘moral deliberation’. Moreover, it is odd to refute inherent subjectivity within private law reasoning. This encourages a mechanical, undesirable process inhibiting the progression of equity. Nonetheless, when considering these obligations, not all moral duties can be enforceable and there is great debate on whether legal obligations ‘invariably’ gives rise to moral ones. But should it be accepted that equitable obligations enforce moral duties, the individual must consider what they should morally do as opposed to what the law asserts. <nl><nl>Agnew suggests that instead of ‘private intuition’, reflecting morally upon a situation contributes to the authority of private law with ‘moral legitimacy’ being easier accepted. It is easier to conform to this ideal in contrast to Birks’ highly plain and systematic approach. However, Birks critiques remain superior in that invocation of conscience in relation to equitable obligations generate great confusion and legal uncertainty. This does not seem to be a ‘realistic aspiration’ of the law. Confusion arises where it is difficult to assume differences between directly enforceable moral duties, and equitable obligations that have no legal standing. Agnew proposes that to limit conscience to cases where courts underwrite moral duties as legal or equitable obligations seems more appropriate. There is greater transparency but its ‘explanatory limits’ must be properly understood. This would fix the need to rely on personal intuition. Nonetheless, courts must be willing to accept a precautionary approach by addressing the confusion conscience poses in the first place.  <nl><nl>The influence of conscience in the courts <nl>Though conscience prevents the ‘rigidity of rules’, its unspecific nature leaves plenty of debate regarding its judicial discretion and capricious outcomes’. Firstly, equitable remedies must be freely available when the claimant’s sole action is to prove unconsciousable behaviour.

Lord Denning submits that when combining resulting and constructive trusts, they can be imposed ‘where justice and good conscience require it’. Nonetheless, critique indeed expected. In the case of Lloyd’s Bank Plc v Rossett, concern over this broader approach was quickly reined in by the House of Lords and the shift towards a more selective one was needed. This concept is well represented in Australian case law where there is greater emphasis of conscience within equity. In the case of Tanwar, when assessing \"unconsciousable conduct’, the court determined that it ‘encourages false notions’, and it is an ‘equitable defence’. Therefore, conscience must demonstrate liability; it is a ‘baseline to judge behaviour’. Similarly, in Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row, conscience was referred to as an ‘objective value judgement’. This suggests conscience as an objective criterion to judge behaviour. Though Birks states that conscience is unspecific, conflicting case law argues quite the opposite; it is appropriate to assume conscience as this baseline in which actions of unreasonable nature are assessed correctly.  <nl><nl>Nonetheless, conscience gives excessive discretionary power to judges. For judges to assume subjective perspectives on a case-by-case basis undermines the integrity of the judiciary and the concept of equity. Within law, certainty is imperative, and an objective conscience allows the law to be better respected and clearly defined. This perceived subjectivity and arbitrariness has existed for many years with post-medieval judgements slowly fading the true definition of conscience.  Therefore, with its endless interpretations, it remains unsurprising that uncertainty remains. Regardless, though it appears that centrality of conscience has been reaffirmed in modern times, equity still lacks clarity within the courts. It was held in Harris v Williams-Wynne, that where a property covenant was breached, the test the courts took in determining whether the act was unconscionable would be for the claimant to enforce their rights at the date of breach. In these instances, judges focus on the facts of ‘each individual case’. Consequently, this language directly conflicts with the ‘value of certainty in commercial life’. Though he does not explicitly agree with Birks, Turner states that there is a severe ‘lack of judicial guidance’. But Hudson disagrees in that conscience is ‘deeply misunderstood’.

This poses great problems.

There is a distinguishing feature here; it does not make sense to assume that conscience of the recipient should be affected ‘but for’ this lack of notice: that it gives rise to a resulting trust. The creation of such interests influence other factors, namely risks and insurance; Birks states that this cannot be left to vague measures of conscience. Therefore, this confusion is ‘intolerable’.

I'm not going to be helping Albatros for the next month as she has a few other RA's so she mentioned that she would have to rotate using us. Honestly, I would love to shadow tomorrow but I have final year orientation day tomorrow so I won't be able to come tomorrow. However, from next week onwards, I am free and willing. And I won't tell you to go away, after all what are cousins for 😁 Thanks for the email Holly-Anne See you then Best, . Hi Sam, I noticed your email and was interested but was a bit hesitant to reply since I am in my placement year, not my final year. I'm just curious whether that will prevent me from taking part in your study. Hope to hear from you soon! Best, . course, 3rd Year Hi Carita, I just thought I'd pass on my feedback and if I get any more, I'll let you know. In the event session Tedman mentioned we had a lower number than previously experienced. It might just have been down to the earlyish start, the fact that it's recorded or that students have unusual sleeping patterns but the ones who did attend, myself included, found it helpful, reassuring and got a lot out of it. Most if not, all were uncertain about things relating to their final years, posters, final year modules and I know for sure the chat with their placement tutor helped tremendously. I'm also encouraging students if they know anyone in their tutor group who didn't attend to fill them in with the information discussed with their placement tutor. Additionally, I know students had mixed feelings about the virtual poster session and having to use a completely different format. Alongside, tech issues that some students were having mixed with a new platform some students felt whether they would have been better done on system perhaps in the form of breakout groups. However, others did manage it fine and they got some valuable information about their posters and potential final year projects. Finally, even though the social event wasn't attended by very many students, it was definitely a fun place to interact with other placement students and fellows who are going through similar experiences and be able to share our ideas in a collaborative manner. Best, . course, 3rd Year"
