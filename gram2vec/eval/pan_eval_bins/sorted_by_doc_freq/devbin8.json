      "raw_text": "Rationale:<nl>Evolving social norms are a prominent feature of our current century. More than ever those who defy the gender binary and expectations of their sex are prominent in our society. An annual month-long celebration of LGBT history is held every February in the UK with gay and civil rights movements a focal educational point. However, suicide rates are higher in those who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming compared to the overall population, (Goldblum, Testa, Pflum, Hendricks, Bradford &amp; Bongar 2016) and sexual minority college students report experiencing a range of interpersonal heterosexism (Hong, Woodfood, Long, &amp; Renn, 2016). This analysis aims to illustrate what is understood regarding the possible discourses of young adults surrounding the LGBT communities, with the main emphasis on heteronormativity and gender binaries. The analysis consisted of a semi-structured interview with an undergraduate student, based on the research question, \"How do undergraduate students talk about heteronormativity and gender binaries?\". Attached below is the interview schedule which details what is understood regarding heteronormativity and gender binary through overarching societal (media, education), economical, and political (health and political parties) themes of the questions. Discourse analysis was deemed an appropriate analysis to gain a deeper understanding regarding gender binary and heteronormativity amongst young adults, and the ways in which these topics are viewed and expressed. Research has demonstrated how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language as practice, hence why it is appropriate for this topic (Wodak and Meyer (2009). For the purpose of confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Katy in this analysis.<nl>Results <nl>Discourse 1: ‘Expectations and Norms’<nl>Katy recognises and highlights the societal expectation and norms that are adhered to gender and the relationship it has with being heteronormative. Katy raises these points through the discursive object of gender and the discourse of societal expectations and norms. She illustrates that the gender binary belief is ‘that there are just two genders…directly linked to sex’ and acknowledges that the endorsement of heteronormative attitudes in childhood such as young cisgender females to ‘like the colour pink’ and young cisgender males to play with ‘plastic guns’. Through the technique of listing, for example ‘a little girl should like girly things, like the colour pink, want to have baby dolls’, Katy demonstrates an inclusive awareness of what is expected of the female gender as a young child, which should mould her into ‘a housewife’, as Katy depicts such toys are ‘kind of training them to be a mother’ which illustrates the future expectations of women guided by heteronormativity. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Katy provides an anecdotal portrayal of sexual health education which depicts the societal maintenance of heteronormativity further illustrating the discourse of societal expectations and norms. She recalls learning how to use a condom but concludes ‘I didn’t find it that useful’ suggesting the school curriculum is not inclusive of LGBTQ+ relations and through disregarding non-heterosexual sexual health perpetuates a heteronormative society. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Discourse 2: ‘Tools of Awareness’<nl>The discursive object of ‘awareness’ becomes prevalent when Katy depicts some of the issues facing individuals who do not conform to gender norms. Katy uncovers a love-hate relationship with the media. She attacks it’s lack of diversity and slow progression; ‘if you look at stuff even from a couple years ago, like how a lot of tv programs have, are just so (1) are so heteronormative’  but credits its role in bringing awareness to sexual minority groups; ‘even that small introduction of a gay couple, or a trans person(.) like even a brief glimpse of it on tv or on and advert is quite revealing’ illustrating the power the media has; it can be used as a tool of oppression or acceptance dependant on the source.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Awareness is further explored in regard to the appropriate proxemics to which orientation should be discussed. Katy establishes the boundaries in which she believes orientation is suitable to be considered. In terms of job applications, she suggests ‘it depends on the role’ when discussing an applicant’s gender, contradicting what was previously discussed regarding gender binary i.e. it raises the question what roles are gender dependant. However, she declares sexual orientation is ‘just not necessary’ for such applications, deeming the process ‘very intrusive’. Through the lexical choice of ‘intrusive’, Katy implies that such questions are invasive of an individual’s privacy, and reflects back on the issues of heteronormativity \"You wouldn’t ask a straight person those kind of questions, instead of being aware I think it has the potential to create a target on that person so no I don’t think an employer needs to know anyone’s sexuality’<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Discourse 3: ‘Economics and Expenses’<nl>Expenses associated regarding the LGBTQ+ community is a dominant discourse when discussing the associated politics. Katy expresses an awareness of political dichotomy in terms of financial support for these communities. Katy exclaims \"they don’t put enough funding into like, uhm(.) well anything LGBT!\". Through the use of hyperbole in this discussion Katy emphasises her belief that the right-wing parties are unsupportive. This is further emphasised through the comparison drawn between the political spectrum, \"I think there’s more sympathy uhm and there’s more diversity within the left wing\". Katy develops a narrative which <nl><data_excerpt><nl>The discursive object of ‘expenses’ evolves from the financial costs to the emotional ones. The discourse expands to the emotional costs of ‘coming out’, ‘transitioning’ and ‘mental wellbeing’ (lines 178-180), the triad of emotional costs Katy presents provide an insight to the volume of pressure individuals who defy the strict gender binary are subjected to and how perpetuating a heteronormative image is mentally damaging.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Katy sympathises with the ‘hardship’ individuals who wish to transition must endure. She raises the issues of emotional expenses and relates it back to the financial costs regarding funding; ‘more funding in place, more support in place…especially [for] young people’. Thereby illustrating the impact of politics on sex and gender and the influence of society. <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The discourse throughout the interview has a lot of empathy undertones towards the issues faced by various LGBTQ communities e.g. gender non-conforming individuals and examines some root issues of such discriminations, for example the societal maintenance of heteronormativity through school teachings. Katy engages with the discourse through the various political, social, economic and cultural questions asked, and responds with awareness of the challenges they are faced and positions herself to be against the discriminations and shows compassion for the individuals who have been subjected to it. As a cisgender female, Katy can empathise with the issues surrounding gender binary; she understands how it feels to be tied to your biological sex and has expressed an awareness of how the relationship between sex and gender can be complicated however Katy can only sympathise for those who have transitioned or are gender non-conforming, this becomes apparent when comparing the volume to which Katy speaks about heteronormativity in comparison to gender binary. This research was conducted with one individual’s perspective; it may not be representative of all young adults opinions of gender binary and heteronormativity therefore cannot be generalised.",

      "raw_text": "Mandler’s model of the adult semantic system is an explanation of concept development that discusses three claims. Firstly, the fundamental distinction between the core categories; animals’ vs non-animals, secondly; the system is organised hierarchically, and finally, the system is categorically organised from its inception. This essay will evaluate the evidence supporting and disputing Mandler’s second and third claims, with emphasis on the latter in attempt to understand adult cognitive functions. <nl><nl>Beginning with the third claim; the semantic system is categorically organised from its inception. Habituation paradigms have been used to examine this implication, using very young infants to investigate distinctions between biological and non-biological motions. Research (Bertenthal et al., 1987) (Simion, Regolin, &amp; Bulf, 2008) has demonstrated young infants’ sensitivity and ability to distinguish between the two motions, therefore suggesting an innate predisposition for this ability, and have highlighted how this distinction is made before language acquisition. Therefore, supporting Mandler’s third claim, whilst also providing supporting evidence for Mandler’s first claim; that distinctions are made animals vs non-animals. The convergence of evidence supports the validity of the conclusions made.  However, such research can be criticised in respects to the validity of the methodology. Habituation techniques rely on reengagement of attention when presented with a new stimulus. The result of the young infants’ habituation and dishabituation may be caused by a perceptual difference, not a conceptual one. A view supported by Sloutsky (2003) who argued infants are good at detecting perceptual similarity but do not have conceptual understanding. When investigating the categorical organisation of the semantic system, habituation paradigms fail to answer at what point this process begins, which challenges Mandler’s third claim, consequently presenting an argument that categorical organisation does not begin as early as Mandler perhaps suggests. Therefore, we can ask, at what point does this early category organisation begin.<nl><nl>To examine this, we must look at Mandler’s second claim; the system is organised hierarchically. There is much debate regarding which depiction of early category organisations is more accurate. There are two main hypothesises which debate the hierarchical organisation.<nl>Rosch (1978) argues a basic-level hypothesis, and suggests we learn concepts in a bottom-up order. The basic-level is the first conceptual level, it focuses on within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Later in development, the superordinate-level emerges and following that, the subordinate-level. The basic-level occupies a privileged position in the hierarchy in semantic cognition (Rosch, 1978), (Bauer &amp; Just, 2017). Supporting experimental research (Daehler, Lonardo &amp; Bukatko 1979) has found infants made basic-level matches more easily than superordinate ones, and case study research (Clark, 1973) has found children’s first words for objects are often basic-level. The triangulation of methods used across the research supporting the basic-level hypothesis suggests consistency across findings and validates their conclusions. That said, this theory cannot explain the linguistic biases children may be influenced by; when adults label stimuli for children, it is often at the basic-level i.e. adults are more likely use the label ‘bed’ rather than furniture (superordinate-level) or sofa bed (subordinate). This infers that such organisation is possibly guided through linguistic influences and not through bottom up processing as thought.<nl>On the contrary, Mandler has provided an alternative depiction of early category taxonomies; the global-conceptions hypothesis. Using a top-down approach, claims an infant’s first conceptual categories are not at the basic-level, but at a global level which resemble superordinate domains, however there are no basic-level classes within them. Supported through her experimental research using object examination tasks (Mandler &amp; MacDonough 1993), it was found superordinate distinctions were made (animals vs vehicles) in young infants but basic-level contrasts were not (dog vs fish). A criticism regarding the validity of this research is made by Jones &amp; Smith (1993) who argue for the importance of perceptually rich stimuli to be used in concept developmental studies. Real dogs and real fish obtain different features to that of a toy version, i.e. smells, textures and sizes. This research lacks mundane realism. Therefore, assuming the distinctions cannot be made between the basic-level contrast is arguably invalid. It is also important to state how negative results for a basic-level hypothesis does not create positive results for the global-conceptions hypothesis.<nl>Reflecting upon the research presented, there is no clear answer to which hypothesis is correct; both present insightful explanations into early categorical organisation and adult cognitive functioning. Neither hypothesis however address the issue regarding perceptual vs conceptual organisation; do infants and children have a conceptual understanding of stimuli or can they just acknowledge their perceptual differences. <nl><nl><nl>Further critiquing Mandler’s third claim in regard to the implication of early categorical organisation being prior to language acquisition. Asking at which point language interferes with conceptual organisation may provide an answer to when we are able to distinguish between perceptual differences and conceptual understanding.<nl>The role of perceptual similarity in categorisation has been investigated by Gelman and Coley (1990) who used typical and atypical category members and looked at the influence of linguistic support upon the judgements made by 2-year olds. They found appearance controls judgement about category membership in absence of linguistic support in young children, however when provided with labels, category membership rather than perceptual appearance guides the interferences about category properties. From this, we can assume older infants obtain a conceptual understanding regardless of perceptual inferences due to linguistic guidance. An important factor of this research is challenging prototypicality of categories, and the influences it has upon children in their conceptual development when organising. It could be argued that prototypicality of prior research into early categorisation may disguise children’s distinctions between perception and conception, suggesting the ability to distinguish may be sooner than this research indicates, supporting Mandler’s third claim. <nl><nl><nl>In conclusion, this essay suggests the research evidence into concept development has greatly contributed to understanding adults cognitive functioning. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding at which stage infants can truly distinguish between conceptual understanding and perceptual differences. One weakness of this evaluation is the research discussed only considers that of typical development and ignores atypical developmental outcomes.",

So I hope you can help me, please. I have also sent the same email to the subject and subject director. I hope you are doing well and hope the Covid-19 situation has not affected you too much. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made a big impact on me and my family. For my well-being, I have had to move to Dallas from my family home in Chicago. I apologise in advance for the lengthy email. I just wanted to confirm whether my decision is okay. So, what I can understand from the university updates via email is that term 1 will consist of mainly online teaching but some on-campus learning. I wanted to know and confirm whether it would okay for me to stay here and continue with my online learning here in New York City. In regard to on-campus learning, I would make use of the resources available online and make my tutors also aware. For example, if there are seminars I would do the work and reading notes electronically and then send them to my seminar leaders and interact with students I know from that class but online instead. This way the University does know I am continuing with my studies. Or if there is any group work, I could communicate with group members online via emailtextSkype. And if I had to come onto campus to present or any other important reasons I could travel to Houston for a week. There are options for me transferring universities or taking a year out however for my own self I do love going to university because it is a great way of distracting myself and I love the environment. Hopefully, for only a short period things at home in Chicago are not good and I thought I would stay in San Fransisco with my relatives that live here and they are supporting me and keeping me distracted. At least till July and I may as well use the Covid-19 online teaching to its advantage. In terms of adapting to the changes being made at university because of Covid-19.

      "raw_text": "Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee’s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>",

      "raw_text": "Having conducted my research for my CEO's stay at Helsinki I have shortlisted a number of places which accommodates her budget. Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs £157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a café. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a café to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Café Kluuvikatu 3, café which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.",
