I have changed the study to use the topic you mentioned as it aligned with the literature, I found on the process of regulation, so it seemed appropriate. Also, I have changed the topic questionnaire into topic as during literatures search I found a significantly worrying amount of research 'debunking' topic as a concept and I'm not sure I could justify looking at topic in terms of topic following that. All other aspects are unchanged, I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Best Wishes, ."

      "raw_text": "Abstract<nl>Partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, where participants were cued, and then attended to a stimulus shown on either the right or left hemifield. 75% of the trials were congruent, in which participants were cued to the same side as the stimulus was presented, and 25% were incongruent. Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch’s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant).<nl>Mazahari et al.’s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing.<nl>Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent.<nl>Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). <nl>Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials.  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant’s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment.<nl><nl>Design<nl>A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in 𝜇V (microvolts)). <nl><nl>Materials<tab><nl>The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1).<nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Alpha band oscillations (8–13Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10kΩ was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved.<nl>Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press ‘L’ if a large or ‘S’ if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants’ attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented.<nl>After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right.<nl>Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset.  The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (𝜇V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk’s test was violated (p &lt; .05).<nl>Table 1. <nl>Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38).<nl><nl><table><nl><nl>Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to.<nl>A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment.<nl>The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch’s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.",

      "fixed_text": "Edeline, I have filled out the form, but I would still like to know if you believe this is the right decision. My main reason for conducting the interviews is because there is limited explicit information on the subject, and I don't want my dissertation to be based on a hunch. Although this will include 8 participants, I understand this can't generalise the native nationality and British nationality on a whole, but it can provide valid evidence for the perceptions. Please let me know your final thoughts, if you believe I should proceed without doing the interviews I will do so. . Hi Minna, I sent my ethics form over to Thacher and I copied you in. When you do see the form, I would like your final opinion on whether I should proceed or not. Also, should I mention interviews in my methodology section for my proposal? Or should I just speak about the sources I’ve used for my literature review? Thank you for your help thus far! . ﻿ Hi Vito, Apologies for my late reply. Thank you so much for your help I really appreciate it. I can’t seem to find the engagement report, could you please let me know how to access it? Also, I opted for question 1 because the other question seem challenging for me. Being analytical is one of my strong points so I think question 1 tailors to it. Once again, thank you for your help. P.S. I hope your son is getting better. . Hi Ekaterina, Just an additional thought! I went on the questions again and question 2 also sounds interesting. I will also consider that question. Probably by the end of this week, I will make up my mind. Thanks once again . Hi Gilberta, I’m happy to hear your son is feeling better! I will definitely take your advice and make sure I select the one that can be done, and also enjoyable. In regards to question 2, when it says developed countries would you say I take generally or speak generally and then use case examples for instance the U.K., Switzerland etc. Hope to hear from you soon ."

      "raw_text": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.",
      "fixed_text": "The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims. Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases. The World Anti-Doping Agency could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records.
