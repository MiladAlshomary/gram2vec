      "raw_text": "The topic of research investigated was Perception of Beauty, this topic was chosen as a result of its major current infleunce within today’s society from influencing an individual’s perception of beauty about themselves and beauty as a social construct. Furthermore, the perception surrounding beauty has not just been relevant to within today’s society it also has had major influences throughout history in terms of the ideal body image evidently seen with icons such as Marilyn Monroe and desired hairstyles amongst culture throughout history. A Discourse Analysis inspired by Willig (2001) take on discourse, was used as it allowed for in depth understanding of themes and constructs which arose from the broad topic of beauty. Followed by the practices of these constructs whilst also adopting a subjective approach based on the interviewees experience. <nl>In addition, using a semi-structured interview was useful for this topic of research as it allowed for both freedom and interpretation of beauty whilst maintaining focus on the interviewees’ perception of beauty.  To ensure confidentiality the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Susan. <nl>Discourse 1- ‘Beauty is beyond skin deep’ <nl>When asked to define beauty Susan’s demonstrates immediately categorises beauty into two categories ‘superficial’ and ‘deeper beauty’. Susan’s attitude towards the discourse of superficial beauty has already been perceived as negative, this is evident through the depth of explanation in which both types of beauty are described. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s shallow explanation of the discourse of superficial beauty positions herself throughout interview as having a negative view of beauty being based on the outward appearance. This again is reiterated through her humour on the discourse, as she states ‘it’s like your outward beauty can get you so far coz you know when you grow old… You get a litt’l crusty’. The choice of the word ‘crusty’, suggests that one’s perception of beauty only being based on outward appearance is futile, as it essentially it will no longer be the determining factor of beauty.<nl>Contrastingly, Susan’s’ in-depth explanation on the discourse of inward beauty suggests the value in which she holds inward beauty as better a perception of beauty to have. The discursive list such as ‘character’, ‘personality’ and behaviour demonstrate the longevity of that aspect of beauty and its hierarchy which constructs Susan’s perception of beauty as it surpasses artificial beauty. <nl>Despite Susan positioning of inward beauty, it can be argued that the opposition of both discursive catergories highlights a sense of wanting inclusivity and identity in the way in which beauty is perceived. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s avoidance of wanting to admit that superficial is more prominent than inner beauty, constructs the feeling of otherness surrounding outward appearance as it connotes a sense of isolation and division from what she desires to be beautiful versus society’s ideals of beauty. The themes which arise from the conflict of these discourses run throughout the interview. As Susan repeatedly positions herself against societies ideals of beauty and her own, this is evident through the consistent use of discursive pronouns ‘I feel likeI think’ and her separation from society as she states, ‘but in nowadays’ (lines 39 and 52).<nl>Furthermore, Susan further demonstrates the discourse of inclusivity through the specific type of social influencers she uses in response to the question asked in line 73.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The examples used by Susan reaffirms this discourse, as the role models appear to display characteristics of the average human such as ‘embracing her tummy’. This non-superficial beauty demonstrated by the role models brings forth implications that Susan’s perception of beauty can also be accepted despite society’s perception of beauty. Furthermore, the discursive object of authenticity, can also be drawn from the examples used in regard to have a perception of beauty that everyone can obtain, this is further seen Susan refers to both sexes. <nl>Discourse 2- Outward beauty is not always negative<nl>Despite Susan presenting the negative aspects of outward beauty it can be argued whether outward beauty is completely negative.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The discourse of style from outward beauty illustrates that outward beauty is not entirely negative as it can also be used as a guide to find one’s own beauty through style, as Susan admits that she was ‘terrible at dressing’. This also exemplifies how outward appearance constructs identity as similarly seen with Susan’s’ previous reference to Ashley Graham and Nella Rose as ‘good influences.’<nl>Moreover, within the discourse of style it can also be argued that not all aspects associated with outward beauty is superficial and negative. This is evident with the use of accessorises and ‘activities such as shaving or ear piercing’ (Sinkman, 2013), used to enhance beauty but is not deemed as a damaging percpetion of beauty concerning outward beauty, as it appears to be a construct accepted in society and to majority of individuals’. <nl>By the same token, from a business perspective it can be argued that the discourse of outward beauty is not entirely negative, regarding the profit made by brands such as L’Oréal, Mac and Huda Beauty Cosmetics, as the Business Insider reported that the beauty industry is ‘estimated worth $532 billion’. <nl>From both examples used above opposes, Susan’s initial perception surrounding the discourse of the outward appearance concerning beauty; this demonstrates the complexity surrounding the discourse of perceptions of beauty as it does not appear clear and cut.<nl>Discourse 3- The Medias’ perception of beauty is damaging<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s’ tempered response to the question asked in line 54 presents the discourse of media being the main reason behind the damaging perception of beauty in particular social media. Social media apps such as Instagram appear to be dominant discursive objects, which influence perceptions of beauty as themes such as self-gratification and acceptance. This is apparent within the example used by Susan as she illustrates a mother’s perception of beauty towards their child in comparison to Instagram’s perception of their beauty. Despite a mother voice having a significance of a child’s perception of themselves, it appears that social media drowns this voice as they quickly conclude that ‘I am not’ beautiful. This abrupt conclusion suggests that social media holds a lot weight regards to perceptions of beauty. <nl>Additionally, the repeated discourse of superficial beauty arose again in relation to the discursive object of social media, the conjunction of both discourses reaffirmed Susan negative attitude towards the discourse’s influence on beauty. This is explicitly seen with her paralinguistic such as the sucking of her teeth and laugh in line 64-65 associated with the discourses, as she refers to it as ‘fake’. Susan’s’ attitude towards the medias false perception of beauty aligns with Sinkman (2013) statement that ‘society is becoming increasingly concerned with mechanisms to obtain or improve beauty, such as beauty enhancements, body modiﬁcation.’ This is apparent within todays current concerns concerning surgeries such as Brazilian Butt Lifts to achieve the ‘ideal body type’, as statistics show that it is deadliest type of plastic surgery with 3000 cases of death. Through this statistic it reveals the social pressure as a discursive object to achieve the ideal perception of beauty.<nl>Moreover, it can also be discussed that social media such as Instagram is not the only outlet of media that produces pressure as a discursive object. Media outlets such as magazines can also present a discourse of pressure and damage about perception of beauty, this is explicit within criticism surrounds fashion magazines such as Vogue; as they were criticised for photoshopping their ‘cover to make plus-sized model look thinner’.<nl>Therefore, it can be concluded that Susan’s attitude towards these discourses holds a certain credibility about the rising concerns of beauty standards within today’s society.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan recognises that the perception of beauty discussed for majority of the interview was Westernised perceptions of beauty and recognises the other cultural perceptions of beauty. <nl>This demonstrates beauty as an ethnocentric discursive object as within every culture what is perceived as beautiful to one may be perceived undesirable to another, in addition it also shows the equal weighing of environment playing an equal factor in perceptions of beauty in correspondence to media which is normally the first considered influenced on beauty.  <nl><nl>Discourse 5- Perceptions of beauty is never fixed <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan shows that the discourse of beauty is temporal, as throughout history what was concerned as beautiful changed this is apparent through eras in history such as Egyptian Beauty and Victorian Beauty. As Egyptian beauty included both male and females going to great lengths regarding appearance, consisting of dramatic dark eye makeup and wigs in contrast to the Victorian Era which involved a pale face and rosy cheeks. The vast difference in beauty amongst these two eras demonstrates the discourse of beauty being temporal.<nl>Susan appears to present that the discourse of beauty is not completely objective or subjective but in fact there is middle ground as the discursive objects such as culture, genre, era play a role in the objective aspect of standards of beauty. Alongside with the subjective aspect in relation to having a choice in what type of beauty an individual wants to adopt. <nl>Discussion<nl>Throughout the interview the discourses presented demonstrate the complexity of perceptions of beauty. This can be seen with the two opposing aspects concerning the discourse of outward appearance, as on one spectrum it is perceived as futile as it conveys an unrealistic beauty standard to obtain. whilst on the other spectrum outward beauty in relation to style is not frowned upon as it is perceived as beauty to aspire to, in relation to providing a guide on fashion. Furthermore, this interview also demonstrated the various influences on both an individual’s perception of beauty and societal construct concerning beauty which is contingent on music genre, history era and culture.

      "raw_text": "Within the study of Psychology, the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspectives have contributed immensely in relation to its similarities and differences of its core assumptions and features. As the assumptions within the Biological perspective consist on behaviour being solely a result of biology such as neurotransmitter and genetics; in comparison to the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective which consist of behaviour-based experiences within the environment and the unconscious. In the following essay, I will discuss the key features and assumptions of both perspectives revolving around their similarities and differences. <nl>The Biological Perspective adopts the nature approach to behaviour, as its assumptions solely revolve around the concept of behaviour is hard-wired. This is evident within its explanation for disorders such as Schizophrenia as Gottesman (1991) found that Monozygotic twins hold the highest percentage of 48% who are at a ‘Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia\" in comparison to the 1% of the General population. This statistic supports the nature adoption of the biological perspective, as it states that behaviour is a result of Heredity as result of monozygotic twins sharing 100% of their genes. <nl>On the contrary, the Psychoanalytical perspective adopts both nature and nurture approach within its assumptions. As Freud proposed the assumption that our behaviour is controlled by the tripartite construction of the mind consisting of the Id, Superego and Ego.  Freud (1949) states that the Id \"contains everything that is inherited\"; this concept of inheritance similarly aligns with the biological perspective of nature having an influence on behaviour. As the Id is considered as the primitive part of the mind which includes innate instincts \"which are sexual in nature and the death instincts such as aggression\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 118). Alongside the nature aspect of this perspective, this perspective also adopts a nurture approach to behaviour in relation to the environment also having a major influence on behaviour. This is evident within the super-ego component of Freud's theory of the mind which is shaped by societal values and family upbringing.  This is developed during childhood essentially acting as a conscience within behaviour and moral guidance in \"attempting to thwart id desires\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 119). In addition to the super-ego, this perspective emphasis on nurture is also evident within Freud's Psychosexual stages of development. As the process of each stage contributes to the development of one's personality, for example during the ages 4-6 gender identity is formed through Oedipus complex (for males) and Electra complex (for females) during this Phallic stage the child will experience unconscious sexual desires for their opposite-sex parent. This unconscious desire is resolved through the child identifying with the same sex parent, therefore, leading the child to form an appropriate affection for their opposite-sex parent. However, Freud proposed the idea if this conflict was not resolved it would result in complex behaviours such as promiscuity and narcissism.<nl>Despite, both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective varying within the nature or nurture approach to behaviour, both perspectives possess a deterministic view of behaviour. As the core assumptions of the Biological Perspective holds the view that behaviour is solely a result of genetic factors and biological components. Similarly, the Psychoanalytical perspective upholds the same notion of determinism in its explanation of behaviour being controlled by instinct drives alongside with the environment also having control over behaviour.<nl>A further difference within these perspectives is the approach in relation to explaining its core assumptions. The Biological perspective adopts a reductionist approach in its explanation of behaviour as it attempts to explain behaviour through simple components such as genes, brain structure and neurotransmitters. This is evident within findings that serotonin and dopamine have a ‘signalling effect on later-life in relation to somatosensory, anxiety and depression' (Suri et al, 2015, p. 318); therefore, this supports the reductionist view of the biological explanation as it reduces complex disorders such as depression to neurochemical basis. Alternatively, the psychoanalytical perspective adopts both a reductionist and holistic approach to explaining behaviour. The use of reductionism is evident within Freud's' explanation of reducing behaviour to the instinctive drives within the unconscious mind. Despite this, this his approach differs as he also adopts a holistic view of behaviour as he considers the individual. This is apparent within the case of Anna O, who suffered from Hysteria a psychological disorder which involved psychological stress manifesting into physical symptoms such as ‘multiple personalities, speech difficulties, bizarre hallucinations, and inability to drink' (Benjamin, 2007, p. 116); these physical manifestations were a result of her grief from her father's death. This case supports the holistic feature in the Psychoanalytical perspective, as it considers other factors alongside unconscious drives which contribute to behaviour in comparison to the core assumptions of the biological approach which is narrow in its assumption. <nl>Furthermore, alongside the difference in their approach to explaining behaviour both perspectives also vary in investigating their core assumptions. The biological perspective is reliant on quantitative methods which provide objective measurements such as brain scans to measure the brain and behaviour; this is apparent within methods such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) which measures the blood flow of the cerebral cortex; consequently, thus providing support for the key biological features of the perspective.  This is evidently seen within research into disorders such as Depression as fMRI scans showed that depressed patients \"demonstrated more pronounced connection between the right frontal eye field and cerebellar area \"in comparison to healthy patients who demonstrated \"showed stronger connectivity between more than 20 frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions of interest and cerebellum\" (Bezmaternykh, D.D. et al, 2018, p. 734).  <nl>Alternatively, the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective revolve around qualitative methods which are subjective in nature. This is apparent with the case of Anna O as discussed above which is a central feature within the Psychoanalytical Perspective as it paved a way for the use of subjective methods such as talking therapy; therefore, providing a deeper insight on the individual than solely on numerical data as evident above within the biological perspective. <nl>By the same token, both perspectives also differ on carrying a scientific discipline whether its assumptions and features can be falsified. This is evident within the consistent falsification of the biological approach. This is evident within the contribution towards the theory of Neurons through the work of Golgi and Cajal. As Golgi produced the ‘first clear pictures of nerve cells' through a staining technique from this he inferred that the nervous system consisted of many neurones but was physically connected to each other (Goodwin, 2015 pg. 74-75). In opposition to the work of Golgi, Cajal proposed the idea that neurones were not physically connected to each other using Golgi's staining technique to support his claim. As result of the falsification of Golgi's theory, Cajal’s work has had a major contribution to the key features of the biological perspective due to the gap between the neurones to now be known as the synapse, this being a pinnacle feature of the biological perspective to explaining the behaviour through neurotransmitters.  From the consistent vulnerability to falsification within the features of the biological perspective, it is apparent that the perspective holds a scientific discipline. <nl>However, it can be argued that the Psychoanalytical perspective holds a similar scientific discipline in relation falsifiability as Hunt (2009) refers to Freud's work being ‘fiercely attacked on one ground or another' therefore providing the psychoanalytical approach with some scientific discipline as its assumptions can be both ‘strengthened and weakened' (pg. 225). This is evident within the development of Neo-Freudians such as Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who rejected the oversexualised perspective associated with Freud's psychoanalytical perspective but focused on the social aspect regarding primary determinates of behaviour such as environment and uniqueness of individuals. Therefore, introducing a different branch from the Psychoanalytical perspective as Individual Psychology. <nl>Finally, despite possessing a similar element of scientific discipline, the psychoanalytical perspective contrasts the biological perspective regarding its scientific credibility due to the subjective nature present within the core assumptions. This is evident within the feature of the Psychosexual stages regarding the development of gender as Freud argued that female gender identity was formed from possessing penis envy as they believed to have been castrated. This theory of female identity essentially within psychoanalytical perspective essentially lacks the scientific discipline in comparison to biological perspective as this feature within the assumption appears to base on ‘Freud's views of women' than evidence and fact. (Benjamin, 2007, p. 130).<nl>In conclusion, despite both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective holding majority of differences within their assumptions alongside the nature of their key features holding similarities both perspectives have successfully become an integral part of Psychology today.",

      "raw_text": "Abstract:<nl>This experiment investigates the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task through an electroencephalogram (EEG). The predictions for this study are that alpha activity would be higher for the left parietal lobe in the cue left (Cl) condition rather than cue right (Cr). 39 psychology students performed visual attention task and were cued to expect the stimulus on either the right or left. This study found that the left condition did have higher alpha amplitudes in comparison to the right condition when recording for P3. The findings for this study supported previous research and found that in conclusion the alpha inhibition is indicative of attention.<nl><nl>Introduction:<nl>‘High alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas’ (Kilesch 2007) and is also reduced in task relevant brain areas. The findings of Handel et al (2011) showed that the stimuli presented to the participants visually were processed on the opposite side of the brain to where the stimuli were, and it is contralateral to the unattended side showing significantly higher alpha power. The results show that if a stimulus was to be presented on the left-hand side, it will be processed on the right side of the brain. A study by Sauseng et al (2005) which is being partially replicated by this study, asked participants to conduct a cued visual attention task and focused on different regions of the brain. The participants responded to a stimulus on a screen after being presented with an arrow that was an indication of which side the stimulus would appear on. The results show the side of the brain in which the stimuli had been processed, will obtain less alpha. There was also a significant effect of cue 200ms prior to stimulus onset recording from P3. These studies all show that alpha activity will be higher on the ipsilateral side in which the stimuli is shown, this supports the AIH. <nl>Therefore, supporting studies suggest that the hypothesis for this study is that the alpha amplitude would be higher in the Cl than the Cr, when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe.<nl><nl>Method:<nl>Participants: A total of 39 undergraduate psychology students volunteered to be a participant, they were split into 5 groups.<nl>Design: The study was a repeated measures design as each participant saw both Cl and Cr conditions. The independent variable is the direction of the cue consisting of 2 levels whether it was left or right, and the dependant variable is the alpha amplitudes measured in microvolts (μV).<nl>Materials: Data was collected using a Biopac MP360. EEG electrodes were used, and AC cream was applied to help with the conductivity and reduce impedance. Everi cream to reduce skin impedance. PsychoPy is used to provide the stimuli and an event marker is sent to the Biopac. A large and small bar stimulus (figure 1a and 1b) in which participants focus their attention to. And arrow cues letting the participants know which side the stimulus will appear on, symbolised by the keys &lt; and &gt;.<nl><nl><figure> <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>The Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35 Hz and channels are set up to allow the left and right cue event markers to be accessed through PsychoPy, the event markers were used to identify when the stimuli were presented. Another channel is set up to record activity from the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz), the sampling rate was 1000 Hz; 1000 observations recorded per second.<nl>The experimenter explained the objective to the participant and consent was given before proceeding, electrodes were then put into place. Following the ‘1020 system positioning’ the active electrode is placed on the P3 site on the left side of the parietal lobe in the brain. The reference electrode is placed at Fz and the earth electrode is placed by the participants hairline. Impedance checks are then done and were kept below 10KOhms. <nl><nl>Instructions were presented on the screen for the participants to follow, stating that a cue will appear indicating which side the stimulus will appear on; left or right. A fixation cross appeared in the centre then followed by a stimulus of a bar either large or small. Participants were then told to press a specific key depending on which bar was presented e.g., \"L\" for large bar and \"S\" for small bar. <nl>Practice trials were completed first to allow them to test run the experiment and understand what they are being asked to do. Participants took part in 4 different conditions with 3 repeats so a total of 12 practice trials. Once completed feedback was given to the participants. Similarly, to the practice trial, participants then took part in the real trial containing 20 blocks of 4 trials in which 50% of the trials cued left and 50% cued right all in a randomised order. In total there was 80 experimental trials.<nl>The cues were presented on the screen for 35ms. Then followed by a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) this is set for 200ms to 1200ms. An event marker is then sent at the onset of the stimulus and the stimulus was then displayed for 50ms. Participants then proceed to respond.<nl><nl>During the study the experimenters explained to the participant what the task was, they put the electrodes in place and proceeds to the impedance test, then the experimenter begins the experiment for the participant to complete. The experimenter recorded the data which was then followed by debriefing the participant about the aims of the study. The experimenter helped to clean up the participant then proceeded to analyse the data that was recorded. <nl>Participants had to read the instructions that appeared before starting the experiment and follow these instructions by pressing certain keys and focusing on what appears on the screen.<nl><nl>Data treatment: <nl>When the experiment is running, event markers were sent to the computer, then to the biopac. This records exactly when the stimuli were presented, this allows the period 200ms before stimulus onset to be analysed for the Cl and Cr condition. <nl>The raw alpha data were then rectified regardless of it being either excitatory or inhibitory. This meant that any negative values were converted to positive values and an average deviation from 0μV was produced. <nl>The data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce extreme values. These data then become rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). <nl><nl>Results:<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows the results for 38 participants as one participant withdrew from the experiment, so no data is provided. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to test whether the data was parametric or non-parametric. As the p value was less than .05, a non-parametric test was carried out. The median RAAA indicates that the Cl condition had higher alpha amplitude compared to the CR condition at the P3 site. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T= 566, n= 38, p= .002).  <nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>The findings support the hypothesis that there is greater alpha amplitude when the stimuli are Cl then when the stimuli are Cr. Our results are consistent with the AIH and Sauseng et al as alpha activity is contralateral to the side it is processed, and our results showed there was less alpha activity contralateral to the stimuli where the visual stimuli had been processed. This suggest that the side of the brain that is not involved with attention has less alpha activity. <nl>A methodological problem of this study is that attention could have been redirected due to being in a distracting environment in which multiple other students were talking. Evidence from previous research (Garrison &amp; Williams 2013) shows that participants do not perform as well when distracted and are more likely to make common mistakes when taking part in a task. To gain more accurate results these limitations will need to be controlled such as being in an environment with minimal noises, therefore helping the participant to focus better.",

      "raw_text": "Introduction<nl>The non-binary gender movement is seen as a relatively new phenomenon due to increased activism in the years 2015 and 2016 (Richards, Bouman, &amp; Barker, 2017). Campaigning for awareness and inclusion by organisations such as the Non-Binary Inclusion Project has brought the conversation into mainstream society, however there is a longer supressed history. Consequently, there is very limited literature regarding non-binary individuals and the social attitudes towards them. Day and Nicholls’ (2019) produced a paper exploring attitudes of non-transgender students towards transgender people which induced interest in the presented research topic. As history has progressed, society has shown to become more accepting of people and ideas that lay outside the norm. However, statistics by YouGov show that 41% of trans people and 31% of non-binary people have experienced a hate crime in the last 12 months (YouGov, 2017). Therefore, research is needed to establish whether attitudes have truly changed.<nl><nl>The research question I was looking to investigate was \"What attitudes are present towards those who identify as non-binary?\". Key discourses to uncover include; what is considered normal with gender, the challenges non-binary people face and whether society is widely accepting of these individuals. This led to the development of the semi-structured interview schedule included as appendix 1. Looking at attitudes towards non-binary individuals meant a participant who was not non-binary could be selected. This facilitated discourse analysis and Willig’s 6-stage process was followed (Willig, 2008). Due to confidentiality reasons, the interviewee will be referred to as Anna.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Key discourses identified refer to the construction of \"others\", identification as a choice and the fluctuating permanence of societal views.<nl><nl>Construction of Others<nl>Anna used language in a way that constructed non-binary people as being separate others. Individuals were spoken about as if they were distinctly different to the interviewee, who identifies as a cisgender female, and to other members of society. This demonstrates the normalisation of identifying as your assigned sex at birth and the rejection of people who do not fit into the norm.<nl><data_extract><nl>The choice of wording being \"experienced something\" to describe non-binary identification almost has connotations of a religious or spiritual awakening. It seems to suggest that non-binary people have had an association with a higher power which had led them to think that they are more than male or female. As gender governs human lives, perhaps non-binary individuals are likened to being more than human. This comment is significant as it regards non-binary people in a higher respect than people who identify with just one gender. Even though they are considered to be others, this may be in a positive rather than negative light. The use of \"experience\" also assumes that non-binary individuals have not always felt this way and that something has occurred in order for this identification to proceed. This indicates a conscious choice, a discourse that will be explored further on.<nl>Despite the previous positive symbolism, Anna goes on to express the need for another category for non-binary people. She initially used the word \"definitely\", which has strong intentions, when explaining that this should be the case. This was retracted when repeating the end of the sentence suggesting that this was misspoke. This could indicate that this was her true opinion which may have then been altered in order to appear more socially acceptable and to fit in with the general consensus of a progressive society. This signifies that society as a whole may not be as complicit in ‘othering’ behaviour as Anna was herself.<nl><data_extract><nl>Again, Anna has added to the discourse of othering by the use of the phrase \"something else\" to refer to non-binary individuals. The choice of the word \"thing\" rather than person is dehumanising and creates a distance between her and non-binary individuals. Anna is no longer able to relate to the \"thing\" and an outgroup has been created. Social identity theory states that members of an ingroup believe that their ingroup is distinctive from and superior to the outgroup which then leads to discrimination against outgroups (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). <nl>In this situation, non-binary individuals are considered to be inferior which aids prejudicial treatment.<nl><nl>In contrast to this, Anna uses the word \"we\" when saying \"we’re living in a free world\". Using this discursive tool places the interviewer, participant, non-binary and gender conforming individuals into the same societal group. This assumes that the free world is for everyone and the same privileges are received by all. She considers non-binary individuals to have the freedom to express themselves how they desire without persecution, which suggests a wider belief that society is permitting of people acting how they choose to. However, this does not indicate that negative attitudes have ceased, rather that people are just choosing to suppress verbal opinions.<nl><nl>Identification as a Choice<nl>Anna heavily drew upon discourses which presented non-binary identification as a conscious choice. Individuals were considered to have alternative experiences to those who identified with their assigned sex which led them towards their identification. This reveals how identifying with your biological sex is considered to be the default and other identifications are decision based.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna has used the term \"believe\" once again when referring to non-binary people. Belief is an expression commonly used when declaring concepts that are intangible or that do not have a scientific basis, for example religion or mythical beings. Likening non-binary people’s existence to something that is either believed in or not indicates that their presence is not acknowledged by society as being authentic. By describing non-binary individuals in this way, it is extremely damaging to their sense of identity. Findings by Johnson et al. (2019) showed that invalidation in multiple social contexts contributed to negative affective and cognitive processes for non-binary adolescents which included confusion, self-doubt and internalised shame. This demonstrates that unconscious negative biases are held in society and these have detrimental effects for non-binary people.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"that’s become quite popular at the moment\" when talking about how people are identifying as non-binary. This is important as it does not denote permanence and likens this movement to a trend or a song. It suggests that people may decide to identify as non-binary while it is popular this year, but this phenomenon will be seen to disappear again as soon as it arrived. By using language in this way to create the discourse of choice, the experiences of non-binary people are invalidated. Their personal struggles with identity are minimised or even dismissed and struggles with stereotyping and bullying are disregarded.<nl><nl>Additionally, by using the word \"recently\" she does not acknowledge the rich and diverse history of non-binary identification and the consequences that derived from identifying in this way. This is due to a lack of knowledge and reflects the lack of queer education in society. A report from GLAAD found that increased knowledge about LGBT people led to lower levels of discomfort towards this community and reduced LBGT discrimination (GLAAD, 2014). This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change.<nl><nl>Permanence of Societal Views<nl>Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. <nl><data_extract><nl>This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn’t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive.

      "fixed_text": "Introduction The non-binary gender movement is seen as a relatively new phenomenon due to increased activism in the years 2015 and 2016 . This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change. Permanence of Societal Views Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn’t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive. This negative outlook suggests that individuals in society are focused on keeping the superiority of their own ingroup, at the cost of the well-being of the non-binary out group. Anna used the phrase \"at the moment\" 5 times during the course of the interview. This was used when comparing non-binary activism to various social movements such as feminism, gender equality and Black Lives Matter. By using words such as \"minute\" and \"moment\", social movements are perceived to be current and short natured.

      "raw_text": "Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the £200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for £308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for £250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra £16 per night (totalling £342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like any further recommendations or changes to your itinerary.",
