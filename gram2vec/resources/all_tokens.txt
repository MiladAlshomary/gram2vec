Brook
,
Thank
you
so
much
,
these
were
helpful
!
I
was
just
wondering
if
I
could
get
the
Week
8
transcript
too
?
😊
Thank
you
for
the
help
!
.
Hi
Murphy
,
So
sorry
for
the
late
reply
,
I
must
’ve
read
this
and
forgot
to
reply
!
Have
you
selected
modules
yet
?
I
ca
n’t
remember
what
the
deadlines
were
in
the
past
:)
module
was
actually
kind
of
fun
,
I
’m
not
usually
a
fan
of
group
work
but
it
was
very
low
pressure
!
module
was
really
interesting
and
has
helped
a
lot
for
some
of
my
final
year
modules
.
Same
with
module-
I
feel
like
these
two
modules
overlapped
a
little
!
module
I
’m
sure
you
’ll
enjoy
as
you
’re
good
at
math
and
enjoyed
module
!
For
me
though
,
it
was
my
worst
grade
haha
!
module
was
my
favourite
of
the
year
,
I
had
a
wonderful
lecturer
which
sadly
has
left
university
!
But
I
’m
sure
you
’ll
enjoy
the
course
content
regardless
:)
the
assignment
was
quite
easy
to
handle
and
as
long
as
you
engage
with
the
course
content
,
you
’ll
do
well
!
So
sorry
again
for
the
late
reply
,
but
I
hope
you
’re
doing
well
!
.
Hi
Christopher
,
Thank
you
for
being
understanding
!
I
’m
not
sure
how
long
university
will
keep
my
email
active
after
I
graduate
,
but
feel
free
to
find
me
on
facebooklinkedin
or
email
me
on
email_address
if
you
need
help
in
the
future
!
Especially
the
application
letter
you
have
to
write
for
your
year
abroad
choices
,
I
’m
happy
to
proof
read
anything
for
you
😊
Oh
okay
,
how
weird
.
That
’s
good
though
,
i
’m
glad
you
have
a
little
more
time
.
Fingers
crossed
for
you
liking
the
module
module
!
I
can
imagine
group
work
right
now
is
n’t
the
easiest-
i
’ve
managed
to
avoid
it
completely
this
year
by
swapping
out
a
couple
group
work
modules
.
With
module
it
was
very
simple
,
just
a
case
each
week
which
you
and
your
team
have
to
make
decisions
about-
if
I
remember
correctly
it
was
multiple
choice
.
Took
very
little
time
,
still
had
that
annoying
aspect
of
members
being
able
to
not
participate
,
but
the
work
you
complete
was
very
low
pressure
.
Additionally
,
each
team
member
hands
in
a
personal
reflection
of
how
you
rate
the
other
people
in
your
teams
contributions
,
so
those
that
make
very
little
effort
you
can
mark
down-
therefore
stopping
people
who
made
no
effort
from
piggy
backing
off
of
the
rest
of
the
teams
work
😊
I
had
one
team
member
who
only
turned
up
for
the
presentation
and
read
his
script
from
his
phone
and
then
walked
off
which
was
frustrating
.
However
,
these
university
experiences
are
good
to
talk
about
when
applying
for
graduate
jobs
and
stuff
,
as
you
’ll
often
be
asked
to
reflect
on
a
time
where
you
had
to
deal
with
a
difficult
co
-
worker-
so
you
can
try
spin
those
negatives
into
a
positive
learning
experience
haha
Honestly
,
I
would
say
that
they
’re
on
the
same
level
,
but
that
’s
because
I
just
view
all
maths
as
difficult-
I
literally
got
the
exact
same
grade
in
module
as
I
did
in
module
.
If
you
’re
good
at
math
,
i
’m
sure
you
’ll
be
great
!
I
hope
you
enjoy
them-
and
fingers
crossed
for
on
campus
teaching
next
year
!

Professor
Leese
,
I
hope
you
’re
doing
well
!
I
just
have
a
question
about
the
module
coursework
after
our
meeting
last
week
...
for
the
order
winning
factors
and
qualifying
are
you
meant
to
just
list
them
in
the
table
and
not
explain
them
?
Me
and
my
friend
have
different
ideas
on
what
we
were
meant
to
do
Also
,
is
it
possible
to
send
you
a
draft
of
my
topic
section
to
get
some
feedback
before
term
ends
?
Just
so
I
know
whether
what
I
’ve
done
is
okay
!
Thank
you
for
the
help
.
Hi
Emelia
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
the
clarification
!
I
have
attached
my
draft
of
the
first
section
,
I
will
start
working
on
the
second
section
after
feedback
in
case
I
have
made
mistakes
or
misinterpreted
the
format
.
Additionally
,
when
writing
I
realised
I
analysed
the
structure
and
infrastructure
elements
and
how
they
correlated
to
performance
objectives
together-
rather
than
in
two
different
sections
,
is
this
something
that
I
should
change
?
Thank
you
for
all
the
help
,
and
I
hope
you
enjoy
your
Easter
weekend
!
I
have
really
enjoyed
the
module
this
term
😊
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Marcelo
,
I
hope
you
’re
doing
well
too
!
Yes
of
course
!
Honestly
,
the
module
is
a
little
like
module
mixed
with
a
little
module
that
you
do
in
second
year
.
You
analyse
culture
and
values
within
organisations
and
how
employees
relate
to
that
,
and
how
businesses
need
to
adapt
.
It
was
actually
really
interesting
,
my
coursework
was
based
on
a
case
study
of
a
company
and
I
applied
behavioural
theories
to
analyse
the
impact
of
leadership
styles
to
the
organisation
.
Additionally
,
how
these
leadership
styles
will
impact
employees
moral
and
motivation
etc
.
I
mainly
focused
on
Sindee
and
Cory
in
my
coursework
,
and
you
’ll
see
both
of
their
theories
coming
up
in
future
modules
.
There
’s
a
little
overlap
with
the
modules
I
’ve
mentioned
previously
,
but
ties
them
together
to
analyse
more
work
related
issues
.
If
you
love
writing
essays
like
me
,
I
think
you
’ll
enjoy
it
!
Just
depends
if
you
’ve
been
interested
in
the
previous
topic
content
such
as
the
module
module
😊
Also
,
last
term
I
did
a
module
called
module
which
is
very
similar
.
Having
module
,
module
and
module
really
sets
a
solid
foundation
for
that
module
.
Hopefully
by
the
time
you
get
to
final
year
they
will
change
the
assessment
format
as
last
term
the
content
was
great-
but
many
people
were
marked
down
for
things
not
mentioned
in
the
assignment
brief
or
marking
scheme
.
Hope
that
kind
of
helps
to
give
you
more
of
an
insight
!
and
I
hope
exam
revision
is
going
well
!
Kind
regards
,
.
Wallace
,
I
had
a
question
about
the
quizzes
I
get
awarded
25
%
extra
time
due
to
disabilities
and
last
year
when
we
had
online
tests
there
was
a
password
protected
quiz
with
extra
time
,
was
just
wondering
if
that
’s
an
option
available
for
these
quizzes
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
Jolyn
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
sorting
this
,
and
thank
you
for
the
tip
!
Will
start
the
tests
on
Wednesday
when
I
’ve
hopefully
finalised
my
essays
😊
.
Hi
Elena
,
Okay
great
,
thank
you
so
much
!
I
will
make
sure
to
do
that
:)

Hi
Rocky
,
I
wanted
to
submit
my
presentation
slides
today
due
to
the
possibility
of
not
having
internet
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
,
however
some
members
in
my
group
have
not
finished
updating
theirscombining
their
slides
into
one
...
If
I
submit
it
now
would
I
be
marked
down
for
the
other
incorrectly
formatted
slides
?
In
addition
,
I
have
no
feedback
for
my
slides
,
so
would
this
affect
my
grade
too
?
Thank
you
.

module
Hi
there
,
I
received
an
email
saying
that
TP2
timetables
were
available
,
however
mine
is
n’t
showing
up
on
system
.
Was
just
wondering
when
that
data
would
be
available
?
Also
,
is
there
the
possibility
of
swapping
a
module
?
If
not
it
’s
okay
😊
Thank
you
.

My

as
there

put
that
as
a

Hi
Viviene

I

notes

but
I
strongly
recommend
them
all

I
personally
enjoy
learning
about
cultures
,
people
and
topic
so
I
felt
my
second
year
modules
were
well
tailored
to
my
interests
.
Additionally
,
if
you
enjoy
math
the
double
credit
module
module
could
be
an
easy

My

flight

we
have

I

for
24
hours

I
just
booked
it
incase
it

please
let

if
university
want
to
look

I

Sorry

,
ended
up
having
to
pay

a
50
hour
flight
via

has
taken
me
a
while
to
get

I
hope
your

got
back
okay

I
was

there
’s
any
possibility

I
have
9
deadlines
for
university
up
until
mid
October
and
they
’re

taking
up
all
of

I
’m
really
struggling
with
them
so
can
barely
focus
on
the
work
for
university
and
I
do
n’t
know
what
to
do
about
this
Also
,
I
was
just
wondering
if
you
know
what
percentage
the
university
work
plays
towards
my
grade
for
the
year
?
And
if
any
of
my
grades
abroad
count
towards
my
year
?
Very
unclear
on
this
!
Hope
you
’re
keeping
well
and
thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give
.
Hi
there
,
I
’m
a
placement
year
student
on
the
course
programme
.
This
year
I
was
selected
to
do
the
double
degree
exchange
with
university
in
Philadelphia
,
Mexico
.
The
opportunity
was
incredible
,
however
as
you
can
imagine
,
this
term
has
been
a
little
hectic
.
It
took
me
weeks
to
find
a
flight
home
as
they
were
being
cancelled
on
me
constantly
,
I
ended
up
having
to
fly
for
50
hours
through
Pheonix
which
not
only
added
to
my
stress
,
but
made
my
jetlag
even
worse
.
It
took
a
couple
weeks
after
coming
home
to
get
back
into
the
swing
of
things
,
but
with
university
work
,
I
fell
behind
.
At
this
moment
I
have
8
pieces
of
work
to
complete
for
university
within
the
next
month
,
all
final
year
modules
.
I
’m
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
double
degree
,
and
due
to
having
to
work
with
the
time
zone
difference
,
group
meetings
and
tutorials
are
often
34am
in
the
morning
which
wipes
my
productivity
out
for
the
following
day
.
I
want
to
do
the
best
I
can
for
the
double
degree
,
but
by
doing
so
I
risk
compromising
my
university
degree
.
I
’m
aware
of
the
October
5189
deadline
for
my
university
placement
work
,
but
with
so
much
stress
this
term
and
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
demands
of
my
placement
year
,
I
do
n’t
believe
I
can
meet
this
deadline
and
be
proud
of
what
I
submit
.
I
was
just
wondering
if
there
was
any
chance
of
getting
special
circumstancesa
deferred
submission
date
?
I
’m
feeling
incredibly
burnt
out
.
The
stress
of
struggling
with
money
due
to
all
the
cancelled
flights
,
not
being
able
to
live
at
home
currently
,
and
all
of
these
deadlines
on
my
plate
has
meant
that
I
do
n’t
feel
like
I
have
the
mental
capacity
to
complete
this
at
the
date
set
.
Please
can
someone
give
me
guidance
with
this
Thank
you
.
Elizabet
,
Thank
you
for
the
help
,
and
I
hope
you
’re
doing
well
😊
I
just
finished
up
my
work
with
university
,
and
will
now
be
focusing
on
finalising
my
reflections
for
university
.
I
was
just
wondering
if
you
have
any
advice
what
you
expect
to
get
from
the
questions
?
Really
hoping
to
get
these
done
to
a
good
quality
and
not
miss
the
mark
on
it
!
Also
,
with
the
new
guidelines
allowing
to
present
without
an
audience
,
is
it
okay
if
I
submit
a
recording
without
presenting
to
you
directly
?
I
’m
currently
having
webcam
issues
that
will
be
sorted
next
week
,
but
I
’m
unsure
of
when
so
I
did
n’t
want
to
rely
on
a
last
minute
meeting
!
Thanks
.

on
a
last
minute
meeting
!
Thanks
.
Hi
Gloria
,
Sorry
for
the
late
reply
,
I
did
n’t
see
this
!
I
have
decided
to
take
the
week
extension
so
will
be
submitting
everything
by
November
2263
😊
I
have
attached
my
draft
,
thank
you
so
much
for
taking
the
time
to
read
it
and
give
me
feedback
😊
I
will
happily
set
up
a
meeting
with
you
if
you
with
to
discuss
it
!
I
have
tried
to
follow
the
topic
format
which
was
recommended
,
but
I
appreciate
any
cricism
or
feedback
that
I
can
use
to
make
improvements
!
That
’s
understandable
about
the
presentation
,
I
just
read
that
we
wo
nt
be
penalised
for
not
presenting
to
someone
,
so
I
hope
that
’s
okay
with
you
too
?
Also
,
your
feedback
on
my
plan
submitted
in
June
said
to
remove
the
section
about
future
recommendations
to
students
?
However
the
brief
said
to
:
"
copied_text
"
And
these
recommendations
equate
to
5
%
of
my
mark
,
what
should
I
do
about
this
?
Thank
you
for
all
the
help
,
.
Happy
time
with
pet_name

deffo
worth
it
!

The
Modules
I
want
to
do
are
:
module
does
not
appear
on
the
module
list
.
Instead
of
"
module
"
I
would
like
to
consider
3356
module
,
however
this
is
only
listed
as
a
module
but
has
no
ability
to
select
or
official
released
specification
so
I
’m
not
sure
if
that
one
would
be
possible
Thank
you
.
Hi
Teodoro
,
I
wanted
to
revisit
my
module
options
despite
already
submitting
them
.
I
have
had
a
couple
issues
with
my
options
which
I
hope
you
are
able
to
assist
me
with
.
I
’m
in
my
first
year
of
course
and
I
’m
interested
in
choosing
either
804
module
or
279
module
to
replace
one
of
my
options
.
However
,
although
available
in
the
teaching
period
records
and
new
module
specifications-
these
modules
are
not
available
to
select
on
system
.
Just
wondering
if
this
is
an
error
?
Thank
you
.

Hi
Conchita
,
I
was
just
wondering
if
you
could
send
me
the
PDF
for
copied_text
.
?
I
just
realised
I
do
n’t
have
the
full
version
and
ca
nt
seem
to
find
a
version
with
pages
5
-
12
Also
,
was
wondering
if
I
was
allowed
to
do
both
reading
and
response
papers
for
the
portfolio
?
Or
if
i
’m
only
allowed
to
choose
one
?
Was
n’t
sure
if
there
’s
any
restrictions
on
what
tasks
I
can
choose
😊
Thank
you
.
Hi
Hermina
,
That
makes
sense
,
thank
you
!
.
Hi
Sasha
,
I
was
wondering
,
for
each
essay
did
you
want
conclusions
?
Or
just
a
conclusion
at
the
end
?
I
’m
just
struggling
a
little
with
keeping
to
the
word
counts
whilst
still
analysing
the
essay
and
applying
theories
to
a
good
level
alongside
the
conclusions
Thank
you
.
Hi
Deina
,
That
’s
fine
!
So
will
the
slides
quiz
close
next
Tuesday
?
Thank
you
!
.
o
yeah
,
I
just
think
I
spend
the
whole
time
stressing
that
it
’s
not
even
a
break
though
😅
I
have
been
do
n’t
worry
❤
️
❤
️
I
love
you
too
❤

Have
a
great
day
bby

Okay
😂
Yes
I
would
love
!
Possibly
start
planning
it
after
this
week
?
Just
so
I
can
get
uni
out
of
the
way
❤
️
I
’m
okay
,
how
’re
you
my
love
?
❤
️
when
are
your
exams
,
💕
I
thought
you
still
had
things
after
your
diss
?
🥺
Oh
!
!
How
’re
they
going
?
I
am
now
!
But
I
’m
still
studying
for
a
different
qualification
so
I
’m
always
happy
to
study
with
you
honey
❤
️
Lorenzo
,
Sorry
for
the
late
response
,
suddenly
got
very
busy
!
I
agree
with
Niven
regarding
the
course
major
.
You
need
to
have
a
strong
interest
and
understanding
of
subject
to
understand
the
content
!
So
definitely
do
the
double
credit
module
module
in
second
year
for
this
.
And
also
,
If
you
’re
interested
in
the
subject
electives-
maybe
enrol
on
the
principles
of
modulemodule
modules
in
second
year
.
However
,
you
may
need
a
first
in
module
in
first
year
to
have
the
prerequisites
for
those
modules
..
Atleast
that
’s
what
I
had
to
do
!
It
may
have
changed
😊
Everyone
in
my
year
doing
the
double
degree
enrolled
onto
the
biology
major
,
and
I
would
n’t
say
you
need
to
focus
on
any
specific
modules
in
second
year
with
that
major
.
The
subject
wave
also
gives
you
the
most
flexibility-
as
you
can
choose
three
modules
that
interest
you
instead
of
having
a
set
syllabus
like
the
rest
.
university
set
you
up
quite
well-
you
’ll
be
studying
a
mixture
of
modules
across
years
,
and
they
usually
give
you
the
introductory
ones
first
to
get
you
settled
😊
For
the
computer
science
major
,
obviously
do
one
or
two
subject
modules
in
second
year
to
give
you
a
better
foundation
.
And
the
physics
major
,
the
modules
seemed
like
it
incorporates
a
mixture
of
subject
and
subject
modules
,
so
you
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
really
...
it
just
depends
if
you
’d
want
two
bachelors
in
course
.
For
this
major
I
would
definitely
study
an
module
module
if
it
is
n’t
compulsory
for
you
in
second
year
,
as
the
module
Module
at
university
looked
fairly
similar
to
what
I
had
studied
at
university-
so
it
would
help
😊
You
’ve
still
got
plenty
of
time
to
choose
your
university
major
,
the
math
major
is
the
only
one
that
I
would
say
you
do
n’t
need
to
think
about
second
year
modules
,
but
the
rest
definitely
consider
what
I
said
above
!
Also
,
be
prepared
for
extra
work
load
,
I
was
quite
shocked
at
the
extra
deadlines
at
university
,
completely
worth
it
for
the
double
degree-
but
take
that
into
consideration
when
choosing
.
Choose
a
major
that
interests
you
the
most
and
you
feel
like
you
’ll
understand
the
content-
makes
the
work
load
much
more
manageable
!
I
’m
awful
at
maths
so
I
purposely
avoided
any
modules
that
would
detriment
me
,
and
I
ended
up
loving
all
the
modules
I
chose
in
the
end
😊
I
hope
that
helps
and
sorry
for
the
long
email
!
.
Darell
,
I
really
hope
it
gets
better
for
you
next
year
,
I
ca
n’t
believe
what
it
must
be
like
to
start
uni
online
!
It
’s
not
a
problem
,
would
always
love
to
help
😊
I
can
imagine
!
I
hope
you
still
managed
to
get
grades
you
’re
happy
with
,
first
year
does
n’t
impact
the
grade
you
graduate
with
luckily
,
if
you
’ve
done
good
this
year
I
’m
sure
you
’ll
do
even
better
when
uni
returns
in
person
and
you
’re
allowed
to
actually
socialise
with
group
members
.
For
sure
!
There
was
another
module
in
second
year
which
had
a
similar
redyellow
card
system
,
so
luckily
things
like
that
are
in
place
so
that
any
lazy
members
ca
n’t
take
all
the
credit
.
Ahaha
very
annoying
,
indeed
!
I
’m
not
sure
if
it
will
be
helpful
as
the
content
may
have
changed
,
but
let
me
know
if
my
notes
from
module
will
be
helpful
at
all
,
i
’m
happy
to
send
them
over
!
Yeah
,
the
double
credit
module
is
stress
...
however
if
you
like
module
in
the
first
term
,
and
you
want
to
switch
to
module
I
believe
that
’s
possible
!
My
friends
who
did
the
module
double
credit
one
did
module
with
me
in
first
term
,
same
content
and
exams
,
and
then
did
the
module
credits
in
second
term-
so
i
’m
sure
it
’s
possible
to
switch
😊
If
you
send
me
the
assignment
briefany
exam
info
like
example
exam
papers
i
’m
happy
to
take
a
look
and
give
you
some
advice
😊
I
ca
n’t
fully
remember
it
as
mine
was
100
%
exam
but
I
got
76
%
so
hopefully
i
’ll
remember
something
from
what
you
can
send
me
!
Also
happy
to
send
you
my
notes-
i
’m
not
sure
if
that
’ll
be
helpful
!
Kind
regards
.
Hi
there
,
I
wish
to
be
a
participant
in
this
study
,
it
sounds
incredibly
interesting
!
Please
could
I
have
more
information
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
Mason
,
Wonderful
!
That
’s
something
I
wish
I
took
more
seriously
in
first
year
,
look
for
all
the
spring
and
summer
work
experiences
you
can
find
!
From
November
a
lot
of
Summer
Internships
will
be
released
so
try
apply
to
as
many
as
you
can
,
the
process
will
prepare
you
a
lot
for
graduate
applications
too
😊
But
remember
university
starts
from
October
,
which
may
impact
your
ability
to
participate
in
summer
ones
...
so
keep
an
eye
out
and
do
some
research
on
spring
programmes
for
your
second
year
that
you
can
do
during
easter
😊
Ahahah
,
i
’m
finding
the
same
too-
I
thought
first
term
would
be
the
hardest
!
Mines
just
the
CGP
subject
A
Level
revision
guide-
you
can
probably
find
a
second
hand
one
for
cheap
on
Amazon-
but
yes
if
you
’re
in
Los
Angelos
at
any
point
I
’m
happy
to
pass
it
to
you
😊
Ah
I
remember
!
I
’ve
attached
my
module
Assignment
and
the
questions
the
answers
correlate
to
,
it
was
three
questions
too
so
it
may
be
similar
!
Just
use
it
as
a
guideline
,
i
m
sure
you
wo
nt
but
do
n’t
copy
areas
as
university
's
quite
strict
on
plagiarism
!
I
got
a
71
,
so
a
fairly
low
first
but
it
should
give
you
an
insight
into
how
I
handled
the
questions
,
and
the
structure
of
them
!
Definitely
do
...
the
library
is
n’t
the
most
helpful
but
system
online
is
genuinely
a
big
lifesaver-
I
even
used
it
at
university
because
it
was
better
than
university
's
online
library
!
No
problem
,
I
’m
glad
it
’s
all
helped
!
I
hope
your
courseworks
and
exams
go
well
this
term
.
Please
feel
free
to
pop
me
a
message
if
there
’s
anything
that
I
can
help
with
in
the
future
😊
Kind
Regards
,
.
Tallie
,
Thank
you
for
the
email
,
that
’s
very
helpful
:)
I
’ve
completed
the
pre
session
tasks
already
,
my
query
was
just
about
the
topic
section
..
You
’ve
uploaded
parts
1
-
3
with
narration
which
I
’ve
watched
,
but
you
have
n’t
uploaded
the
stand
alone
PowerPoint
slides
for
part
2
and
3
and
the
guest
lectures
were
v
informative
No
problem
!
Glad
I
can
help
😊

Hi
Cynthea
,
Thank
you
for
letting
me
know
,
I
’ll
update
my
notes
after
the
webinar
😊
Sorry
for
the
confusion
!
I
was
n’t
trying
to
know
the
answers
before
the
webinar
,
I
just
wanted
to
get
the
diagrams
copy
and
pasted
early
so
that
the
notes
were
there
when
I
needed
them
in
the
future
to
use
with
my
disability
software
.
Just
wanted
to
get
ahead
with
the
admin
side
of
work
so
I
can
focus
more
on
the
assignment-
but
I
know
now
not
to
do
that
,
sorry

😊
Thank

Micky
,
Very
sorry
,
I
joined
the
webinar
but
my
computer
has
died
because
of
a
power
cut
:(
hopefully
I
’ll
be
able
to
join
again
soon
but
I
’m
worried
I
’ll
miss
the
break
out
rooms
?
I
’ll
watch
the
recording
whenever
it
becomes
available
to
catch
up
So
sorry
for
this
,
.
Dear
team
,
I
am
a
final
year
student
studying
course
,
I
just
wanted
to
enquire
whether
I
can
request
additional
support
?
I
contacted
my
needs
assessor
and
they
said
it
would
be
best
to
contact
you
as
she
had
written
extra
time
for
submissions
in
my
report
.
The
nature
of
studying
online
this
year
has
meant
I
’ve
had
increased
amount
of
reading
material
from
lecturers
..
often
lectures
are
shorter
this
year
and
they
make
up
for
this
with
reading
materials
.
I
do
n’t
mind
this
,
however
as
I
have
slower
processing
speeds
I
have
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
.
Even
implementing
a
9
-
6
study
schedule
,
and
reading
throughout
reading
week
,
I
’m
still
a
week
or
two
behind
on
some
module
content
and
I
do
n’t
wish
for
this
to
impact
the
quality
of
my
coursework
.
Is
there
any
chance
of
getting
a
small
extension
approved
for
atleast
one
of
my
courseworks
?
I
really
am
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
amount
of
readings
being
set
this
year
and
I
feel
so
burnt
out
that
I
do
n’t
know
how
to
keep
managing
all
the
workload
that
’s
due
in
December
.
Thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give

Hi
Clayborn
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
😊
My
coursework
deadlines
are
in
October-
so
university
have
said
they
’re
not
eligible
for
the
Covid
Extension
,
which
was
why
I
was
wondering
if
I
can
get
a
disability
extension
as
my
struggles
are
deriving
from
my
slower
processing
speeds
and
increase
in
materials
to
read
.
I
’ve
tried
to
stagger
my
assessments
,
I
’m
at
a
good
place
with
one
of
them
I
believe
,
but
the
other
one
as
its
due
on
the
same
day
,
I
’m
worried
that
the
quality
will
suffer
as
I
have
a
lot
to
read
before
I
’m
supposed
to
get
started
with
it-
so
I
do
n’t
know
what
to
do
.
Thanks
for
any
help
you
can
give
.
Corporate
Social
Responsibility
.
So
even
though
CSR
can
be
used
as
a
distracting
technique
per
se
,
the
charitable
contributions
produce
a
legitimisation
effect
,
which
can
help
with
political
activities
such
as
lobbying
,
access
to
policy
elites
,
and
constituency
building
due
to
the
increased
positive
brand
image
.
Final
Analysis
to
Conclude
It
is
without
a
doubt
that
there
is
a
strong
relationship
between
corporate
social
responsibility
and
political
influence
from
the
research
provided
above
.
However
,
as
expressed
previously
,
different
industries
are
likely
to
use
political
CSR
in
vastly
alternative
ways
,
leading
this
topic
to
be
challenging
to
analyse
.
Most
research
surrounds
public
health
and
environmental
corporations
that
produce
negative
externalities
to
society
.
Therefore
,
even
though
the
research
utilised
shows
the
strengths
in
the
relationship
,
it
can
not
be
entirely
reliable
and
applied
to
all
industries
.
The
research
provided
in
this
paper
suggests
that
there
is
a
relationship
whereby
CSR
is
used
as
an
insurance
mechanism
against
political
risks
,
insinuating
that
corporations
are
likely
to
increase
CSR
activities
when
the
political
environment
is
uncertain
.
Without
a
doubt
,
industries
working
against
the
public
’s
welfare
have
benefitted
from
using
CSR
as
a
means
to
gain
political
influence
,
as
seen
with
the
oil
and
gas
industries
"
greenwashing
"
activities
,
Coca
-
Cola
’s
constituency
building
and
BAT
’s
donations
to
shape
policy
agenda
.
Additionally
,
improving
brand
image
has
been
seen
to
help
corporations
legitimise
operations
to
shape
the
views
of
the
public
and
policy
setters
by
forming
a
sense
of
trust
.
In
order
to
identify
the
true
relationship
between
corporate
social
responsibility
and
political
influence
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
expand
research
in
a
broader
range
of
industries
.
The
available
research
displays
a
pattern
between
increasing
CSR
practises
when
operational
activities
are
not
in
the
public
interests
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
there
is
a
strong
relationship
between
CSR
and
political
activities
,
at
least
in
the
industries
concerning
public
health
and
energy
,
or
involving
questionable
product
safety
.
If
this
were
applied
to
industries
that
do
not
primarily
work
against
public
welfare
,
there
would
be
a
weaker
relationship
between
CSR
and
political
influence
.
Hi
Ms
,
After
reviewing
the
local
area
in
Helsinki
,
I
have
planned
an
itinerary
for
you
to
view
.
Firstly
,
Hotel
Haven
has
a
superior
room
between
the
2nd
and
4th
of
September
,
a
30
-
minute
drive
from
the
airport
into
the
city
centre
.
The
hotel
is
the
closest
to
the
water
that
I
could
find
,
averaging
Â£163
a
night
.
The
room
also
includes
a
"
great
"
breakfast
,
as
booking.com
states
;
however
,
local
cafes
are
available
if
you
wish
to
venture
out
.
Cafe
Roasberg
serves
"
The
Best
"
Coffee
and
is
a
hotspot
for
breakfast
options
within
a
distance
from
the
hotel
.
Roasberg
is
a
10
minute
walk8
minute
bus9minute
car
journey
from
the
hotel
.
For
local
cuisine
options
,
I
discovered
Kalerian
Stew
,
a
traditional
meat
dish
that
combines
pork
and
beef
,
and
no
seafood
ingredients
are
included
.
Konstan
Molja
is
famous
for
its
stew
in
Helsinki
,
and
the
restaurant
is
a
21
minute
walk8
minute
drive16
-
minute
bus
from
the
hotel
.
Regarding
museums
to
explore
the
city
's
history
,
the
national
museum
of
Finland
explores
the
regions
past
and
cultural
heritage
.
This
is
a
21
minute
walk6
minute
drive12
-
minute
bus
from
the
hotel
.
Souvenir
shops
conveniently
surround
the
hotel
,
and
I
have
chosen
Kankurin
Tupa
,
a
6
-
minute
walk
around
the
corner
.
They
appear
to
have
a
large
selection
of
items
which
I
'm
sure
you
'll
be
able
to
find
something
suitable
for
your
children
.
Finally
,
G
Livelab
in
Helsinki
is
an
8
minute
walk4
minute
drive
from
the
hotel
and
has
good
wine
and
cocktails
available
.
Along
with
this
,
numerous
reviews
state
that
they
have
a
good
atmosphere
,
and
although
they
are
primarily
a
live
music
venue
,
they
host
the
occasional
improv
comedy
night
for
10
Euros
.
I
hope
this
all
sounds
appealing
to
you
.
Xian

Mr
Sibella
,
Just
wanted
to
email
to
apologise
for
missing
your
lecture
this
morning-
I
caught
a
cold
over
the
weekend
and
after
attending
all
my
lectures
yesterday
,
I
appear
to
have
gotten
worse
and
decided
to
take
the
day
off
to
recover
I
have
caught
up
with
everything
in
the
lecture
through
friends
notes
and
i
'll
make
sure
to
be
in
your
next
lecture
!
Thank
you

Hi
Dr
Bertram
,
I
’m
emailing
to
ask
about
my
extra
time
for
the
online
module
exam
I
was
n’t
emailed
for
the
last
test
about
how
to
access
the
25
%
extra
time
online
test
and
I
really
struggled
to
answer
all
the
questions
because
of
this
.
The
team
confirmed
that
I
’m
entitled
to
get
25
%
in
exams
.
Is
there
any
way
in
which
I
could
be
given
access
to
this
before
the
deadline
?
Thank
you
,
.

Hi
Sandy
,
I
’m
really
interested
in
applying
for
university
’s
Summer
School
for
the
First
session
in
November
I
was
curious
about
how
much
this
would
cost
as
it
appears
to
be
subsidised
for
exchange
partner
universities
...
but
i
’m
not
sure
if
that
would
apply
to
me
or
whether
I
have
to
pay
the
full
fee
?
Could
you
possibly
give
me
more
details
on
this
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
Daisy
,
I
made
a
massive
mistake
by
submitting
my
module
Essay
into
both
the
Essay
and
CV
section
on
turn
it
in
I
will
be
going
to
the
course
office
in
the
morning
before
the
deadline
to
ask
what
to
do
,
but
I
felt
that
I
should
email
you
too
.
Is
there
any
way
I
can
resubmit
the
CV
?
Thank
you
.

Hi
Dr
Dela
,
We
spoke
briefly
after
the
biology
overview
for
first
years
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
just
wanted
to
follow
up
one
of
my
questions
.
I
expressed
my
interest
in
the
year
abroad
opportunity
with
university
,
and
I
have
figured
out
that
I
do
meet
the
finance
side
of
the
visa
requirements
so
I
am
no
longer
worried
about
that
.
However
,
I
am
still
wondering
what
suggested
modules
I
should
take
in
my
second
year
that
would
help
me
with
the
biology
course
at
university
?
Thank
you
.

Britt
,
So
sorry
about
this
,
I
have
attached
the
word
version
now
!
I
’m
unsure
honestly
,
we
have
n’t
been
told
a
date
yet
!
I
did
n’t
realise
it
was
14
days
from
the
final
results
,
I
thought
it
was
provisional
No
worries
,
I
hope
you
have
a
great
bank
holiday
weekend
!
.
Hi
Johannah
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
taking
the
time
to
do
this
!
I
’ll
definitely
read
the
research
and
find
a
way
to
incorporate
it
!
I
’m
really
glad
I
switched
to
your
module
this
term
,
I
really
have
learnt
a
lot
Regarding
the
highlighted
sections
,
just
wondering
if
there
was
a
reason
for
each
colour
in
the
first
entry
?
I
shall
work
on
it
more
today
and
tomorrow
and
will
take
your
comments
in
mind
I
hope
you
have
a
good
summer
break
!
Thank
you
for
everything
this
term
.
Hi
Dinah
,
Just
wanted
to
get
some
information
for
the
exam
on
Tuesday
...
I
noticed
the
word
limit
is
300
per
question
.
Are
we
allowed
+
-
10
%
or
is
300
the
maximum
limit
?
Thank
you
for
your
help
this
term
and
the

I
really
enjoyed
this

it
was
a
great

!
Keep
well
and
safe

Hi
there
!
I
messaged
previously
about
being
part
of
the
study
but
I
was
worried
that
I
would
n’t
be
able
to
participate
with
my
uni
exams
coming
up-
however
I
’m
now
fully
free
and
noticed
you
were
still
looking
for
participants
?
If
that
’s
the
case
,
please
send
me
the
paperwork
again
and
I
’ll
return
it
straight
away
:)
Thank
you
.
Hi
Elysia
,
I
have
booked
for
the
9960
of
August
,
I
hope
that
’s
okay
!
I
am
free
tomorrow
but
I
was
not
able
to
book
that
slot
for
some
reason
so
the
5501
is
when
I
’m
next
free
😊
Thank
you
and
see
you
soon
.
Davine
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
and
attaching
my
offer
letter
,
sadly
could
n’t
find
it
in
my
junk
email
so
I
do
n’t
know
what
happened
there
!
I
’ve
started
the
process
of
accepting
my
offer
,
however
when
I
click
the
link
to
do
so
,
this
page
comes
up
and
i
’m
not
sure
how
to
get
round
it
?
Sorry
to
be
a
bother
again
!

Hi
there
,
Over
a
month
ago
I
submitted
a
study
abroad
application
to
take
the
double
degree
at
university
this
October
.
I
was
one
of
four
from
my
university
to
be
nominated
,
and
the
other
three
applicants
have
heard
back
and
received
their
documents
to
pay
for
medical
insurance
,
visas
and
flights
over
three
weeks
ago
.
It
’s
now
just
over
a
month
until
I
should
be
flying
to
Britain
,
but
I
have
not
received
any
correspondence
from
university
to
organise
medical
insuranceInternational
student
number
to
apply
for
my
Visa
and
am
worried
there
is
a
reason
for
this
delay
.
I
was
told
you
would
be
able
to
assist
me
with
this
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
there
,
I
’m
in
your
module
class
and
ca
n’t
see
my
marks
for
the
case
study
assignment
?
I
submitted
late
with
an
extension
so
I
understand
if
they
’ll
be
delayed
!
Would
just
like
to
know
:)
Thank
you
.
Hi
there
I
would
be
happy
for
my
details
to
be
passed
on
yeah
Thank
you
.
Hi
Zelma
,
I
would
be
okay
with
flying
to
Philadelphia
,
but
I
’m
worried
that
the
connection
time
there
would
be
risky
if
anything
was
to
change
whilst
I
’m
flying
,
as
I
know
they
’ve
closed
their
borders
already
but
currently
still
allowing
transit-
and
I
sadly
do
n’t
know
RussianArabic
:(
also
business
are
cancelling
domestic
flights
daily
which
is
a
little
risky
too
...
Same
with
New
York
City
as
I
know
San
Jose
have
closedor
are
closing
:(
I
would
be
the
most
comfortable
with
Seattle
,
as
Brazil
is
English
speaking
,
but
obviously
as
this
is
the
most
expensive
,
I
do
n’t
want
to
put
pressure
if
that
’s
an
issue
,
I
can
fly
on
the
other
flights
if
you
think
it
’s
worth
risking
?
If
I
had
to
stay
put
in
Brazil
,
I
would
n’t
mind
doing
so
,
but
I
do
n’t
have
money
to
cover
my
living
expenses
past
my
original
return
date
:(
Thanks
for
getting
back
to
me
.
Karla
,
That
’s
completely
understandable
,
must
be
a
busy
time
!
I
am
free
on
Saturday
yes
,
what
time
would
be
best
for
you
?
Thanks
.
Hi
Jenni
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
!
I
can
do
10
for
a
meeting
if
it
’s
still
good
for
you
?
:)
Completely
understandable
!
I
’m
happy
to
just
record
it
as
I
’m
worried
that
I
wo
n’t
be
ready
to
present
for
a
specific
time
!
Perfect
,
thank
you
,
I
shall
keep
that
in
then
!
Sorry
for
leaving
this
so
late
!

Hi
Phineas
,
I
should
be
able
to
do
tomorrow
morning
,
but
just
incase
could
I
have
some
comments
just
incase
?
and
also
would
like
to
"
copied_text
"
So
I
can
work
on
it
more
tonight
!
I
have
a
birthday
thing
tomorrow
so
I
need
to
check
what
time
I
have
to
sort
things
out
in
the
morning
,
I
shall
email
you
later
to
confirm
if
I
can
do
10
!
Thanks
for
getting
back
to
me
:)

Hi
Marcelline
,
Just
wondering
if
today
is
still
good
for
you
?
Thanks
:)
.
Microsoft
teams
okay
?
I
only
have
my
phone
so
ca
n’t
do
video
:)
Hi
Clarey
,
Thank
you
for
the
feedback
the
other
day
!
I
submitted
my
placement
portfolio
on
time
,
the
recording
took
5
hours
as
the
system
software
recommended
kept
crashing
or
stopped
recording
the
sound
half
way
,
so
it
was
a
stress
!
I
was
n’t
able
to
include
all
my
grades
on
the
presentation
as
they
were
n’t
released
on
time
,
but
I
’ve
now
received
them
and
they
’re
what
I
predicted-
7
,
6
,
5
,
5
...
Averaging
5.75
across
the
two
terms
.
I
was
n’t
sure
if
you
needed
these
for
your
records
!
Both
my
5
’s
were
1
mark
and
4
marks
away
from
a
6
which
would
bring
me
to
a
6
overall
across
the
two
terms
!
I
’m
tempted
to
ask
for
a
mark
review
as
I
was
aiming
for
a
6
,
so
missing
it
by
.25
is
a
little
heartbreaking
:))
I
shall
keep
you
updated
on
how
this
goes
!
.
�
you
might
want
to
get
a
wall
checker
thing
to
make
sure
you
do
n’t
drill
into
any
pipes
or
electric
☹
️
🥺
🥺
🥺
Just
wanted
to
say
I
’m
happy
and
proud
of
you
for
getting
that
job
,
especially
if
the
interview
was
hard
!
Do
n’t
listen
to
mother
Melloney
Benetta
if
they
say
anything
about
the
money
,
I
’m
sure
it
’s
what
’s
best
for
you
right
now
,
especially
with
the
dog
coming!
❤
️
perfect
time
to
destress
but
also
have
a
little
money
coming
in
💖
God
damn
😂
😂
😂
That
’s
still
good
though
!
!
!
Money
is
money
at
the
end
of
the
day
:)
hunni
,
any
chance
you
’re
seeing
mother
during
the
week
next
week
?
?
Was
that
where
the
tanks
were
?
I
rememberrrrr
Lemme
think
xo
That
’s
understandable
!
Do
you
know
how
wide
that
space
is
?
?
I
’m
literally
had
that
image
ready
to
send
you
AHAHA
I
think
floating
shelves
would
be
cute
One
sec
xo
I
do
n’t
know
my
inches
😂
Only
problem
is
you
’ll
have
a
5
cm
gap
on
both
sides
Get
out
of
my
brain
please
Argos
have
120
cm
long
shelves
but
they
’re
£
25
so
ikea
’s
definitely
the
cheapest
☹
️
I
would
say
so
!
They
work
in
my
room
pretty
good
so
I
vouch
for
their
quality
😅
Lanita
,
Thank
you
for
this
.
I
have
reached
out
to
the
module
leader
and
we
shall
discuss
this
further
on
Saturday
morning
😊
Was
just
a
little
distressed
as
I
followed
the
mark
scheme
and
the
brief
yet
managed
to
get
the
lowest
grade
i
’ve
ever
achieved
at
university
.
The
Module
this
involves
is
6667
module
,
system
states
that
it
was
marked
and
feedback
was
added
at
6
am
yesterday
,
so
i
’m
unsure
if
it
has
been
double
marked
?
Hoping
to
clear
this
up
with
the
module
leader
,
he
’s
very
supportive
so
hopefully
if
I
can
explain
my
assignment
to
him
and
how
i
’ve
achieved
the
brief
i
’ll
be
able
to
get
my
mark
boosted
somehow
.
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
support
.
Hi
Zonnya
,
I
had
the
meeting
with
my
module
leader
today
,
and
after
discussing
my
assignment
,
I
would
like
to
make
an
appeal
.
He
mentioned
how
he
got
it
second
marked
and
they
had
marked
the
assignment
a
little
higher
,
but
still
within
the
2:2
boundary
.
However
,
he
said
the
appeal
marker
would
be
marking
against
the
brief
and
I
feel
that
this
gives
me
an
advantage
.
He
stated
that
the
arguments
I
made
would
be
a
compelling
reason
to
include
in
the
appeal
.
I
understand
there
is
a
risk
of
my
grade
decreasing
,
but
even
if
it
drops
I
’m
still
confident
in
my
ability
to
graduate
with
a
2:1
..
if
I
can
get
a
remark
to
a
2:1
then
my
chances
of
graduating
with
a
first
becomes
possible
again
.
He
said
I
would
need
to
organise
the
appeal
with
you
,
but
i
’m
unsure
about
this
process
?
Thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give
.
Hi
Pate
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
with
this
.
I
would
like
to
just
say
that
I
do
not
question
Fernandina
ability
to
mark
well-
he
was
a
great
lecturer
this
term
and
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
module
,
which
is
why
I
was
saddened
by
my
mark
as
I
engaged
heavily
in
extra
reading
out
of
interest
.
My
appeal
was
n’t
on
the
grounds
of
academic
judgement
,
my
problem
with
my
mark
was
primarily
due
to
being
marked
down
for
things
that
are
n’t
specified
in
the
assessment
brief
or
mark
scheme
.
For
example
,
it
was
noted
that
in
order
to
do
well
,
my
essay
must
show
that
I
have
engaged
with
content
and
extra
reading
,
which
even
my
feedback
states
I
have
achieved
.
Additionally
,
the
brief
stating
"
Feel
free
to
introduce
your
own
personal
reflections
where
you
feel
they
are
relevant
,
but
keep
these
reflections
concise
and
do
not
let
them
distract
from
the
overall
task
"
In
my
instance
,
I
decided
to
reflect
rarely
as
I
did
not
believe
this
was
compulsory
by
the
use
of
"
feel
free
"
and
instead
wished
to
avoid
risking
distraction
.
However
,
this
was
something
I
was
marked
down
for
.
However
,
regarding
the
actual
assignment
,
I
compared
my
interviewee
’s
culture
to
my
own
by
referencing
the
different
cultural
dimensions
between
the
UK
and
Britain
,
and
applied
this
to
the
work
place
issues
as
asked
of
me
in
the
brief
.
Basically
,
I
completely
trust
Karil
judgement
,
my
concern
is
just
that
I
achieved
exactly
what
the
brief
asks
of
me
,
and
in
relation
to
the
marking
criteria
where
the
2:2
boundary
states
:
"
copied_text"-
The
feedback
states
that
if
anything
I
was
heavy
on
research
"
copied_text"-
I
included
an
extra
section
from
what
was
included
in
the
brief
so
arguably
more
than
some
effort
was
made
"
copied_text".-
On
top
of
the
interview
I
included
a
survey
I
also
completed
with
the
interviewee
to
further
understand
her
culture
in
relation
to
the
topic
,
showing
extensive
efforts
.
Therefore
for
these
reasons
,
I
genuinely
believe
that
50
%
was
incredibly
low
if
the
marking
criteria
was
considered
.
I
take
pride
in
the
fact
i
’ve
not
ever
achieved
below
a
first
for
written
coursework
assignments
,
so
I
hope
that
you
can
understand
this
came
as
a
little
shock
to
me
.
For
future
students
,
please
ensure
that
if
something
is
compulsory
,
it
is
stated
on
the
assignment
brief
so
that
it
is
n’t
missed
somehow
like
I
did
.
Regarding
the
mark
from
the
external
examiner
,
will
they
be
aware
of
the
mark
before
marking
my
work
?
Either
way
,
I
am
happy
to
be
included
in
the
sample
for
this
module
.
If
my
grade
increases
it
raises
my
chances
of
graduating
with
a
1st-
if
it
decreases
then
either
way
I
’m
confident
in
my
ability
to
obtain
a
2:1
.
Thank
you
again
for
getting
back
to
me
,
and
I
hope
you
’re
keeping
well
and
safe
!
.
there

Can
I
request
for
my
disability
extension
to
be
added
to
my
module
Assignment
due
on
the
5960
of
November
?
From
my
understanding
the
Covid
extensions
wo
nt
apply
to
any
assignments
before
the
128
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
Eric
,
I
’ve
resubmitted
my
essay
like
three
times
now
because
I
left
adding
more
,
but
I
just
noticed
that
on
word
my
word
count
was
under
2500
,
but
system
says
my
word
count
is
nearly
30
words
over
Is
this
okay
,
or
shall
I
edit
it
?
Thank
you
for
your
help
this
term
!
.
Hi
there
,
I
’m
contemplating
swapping
a
module
or
two
,
I
have
contacted
the
module
leaders
to
find
out
more
information
before
I
make
my
final
decision
,
but
I
was
wondering
how
I
could
do
so
?
Additionally
,
the
modules
i
’m
interested
in
possibly
changing
to
are
5495
module
8282
module
8692
module
,
but
due
to
the
unfamiliarity
of
this
process
I
do
not
know
how
to
respectfully
approach
this
issue
?
I
was
just
extremely
disheartened
by
getting
a
50
in
a
subject
I
enjoyed
so
much
,
and
especially
in
my
final
year
where
I
’m
working
so
hard
to
get
a
first
,
and
my
other
grades
reflect
this
too
.
Thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give
,
and
sorry
for
the
long
email
!
.
Celestine
,
I
’m
a
final
year
student
in
your
module
Module
.
I
have
two
questions
to
ask
of
you
...
I
have
a
disability
which
impacts
my
processing
speeds
,
and
although
I
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
your
lectures
.
Hi
Hoyt
,
I
have
emailed
him
,
just
awaiting
his
response
😊
I
believe
out
of
the
three
options
,
my
appeal
aligns
more
with
"
copied_text
"
As
mentioned
previously
,
I
was
marked
down
on
elements
not
mentioned
on
the
official
assignment
brief
,
and
my
feedback
contradicts
the
grade
given
on
the
marking
scheme
for
the
reasons
mentioned
previously
.
During
a
pandemic
where
in
person
teaching
is
not
available
,
and
communication
is
harder
with
lecturers-
especially
for
a
deadline
out
of
term
time
where
we
were
n’t
permitted
to
get
help
after
June
9581
,
I
do
n’t
think
its
fair
to
mark
from
materials
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
or
mark
scheme
.
So
I
do
believe
there
was
some
sort
of
material
irregularity
if
I
was
marked
down
for
things
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
.
I
hope
that
makes
sense
?
Thank
you
for
all
your
help
!
.
Morley
,
I
hope
you
’re
doing
well
and
have
enjoyed
the
easter
weekend
!
I
have
booked
an
appointment
with
you
tomorrow
to
discuss
my
assignment
.
You
mentioned
previously
that
you
would
be
willing
to
read
a
draft
,
so
I
have
attached
that
!
No
rush
to
read
it
before
the
appointment
,
I
can
wait
for
email
feedback
if
it
is
easier
for
you
😊
An
issue
that
I
am
having
with
my
first
section
is
integrating
the
topic
model
into
my
answer
,
I
have
never
referenced
a
court
case
so
followed
what
Harvard
guides
online
recommended
...
but
I
’m
unsure
if
this
is
correct
.
Does
it
look
okay
to
you
?
Thank
you
for
all
the
help
this
term
,
and
sorry
for
all
the
questions
,
I
really
wish
to
be
able
to
graduate
with
a
good
grade
😊
Kind
regards
,
.
Trixy
,
Sorry
for
the
late
reply
,
I
’ve
booked
a
meeting
with
you
for
Saturday
as
I
failed
to
send
this
to
you
sooner
.
I
’ve
marked
a
page
and
a
half
and
shifted
down
the
rest
of
what
I
have
written
so
please
ignore
the
rest
!
I
will
continue
to
work
on
it
this
week
so
it
is
very
much
a
draft
,
but
any
feedback
is
greatly
appreciated
😊
Thank
you
so
much
for
the
help
and
I
hope
you
’re
enjoying
the
lovely
weather
!
.
Hi
Win
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
so
fast
!
I
completely
agree
with
your
comments
,
now
that
I
am
mostly
done
with
my
other
modules
,
hopefully
I
can
focus
on
making
more
direct
links
instead
of
being
distracted
!
I
have
made
some
edits
to
integrate
my
research
to
address
the
question
,
hopefully
the
changes
are
okay
.
Is
it
still
okay
for
me
to
meet
with
you
tomorrow
?
Would
just
like
to
clarify
something
with
you
!
Thank
you
for
all
the
help
,
hope
you
’re
doing
well
and
enjoying
the
sun
!

Hi
there
,
I
wish
to
request
week
extensions
for
my
module
Module
and
module
Module
courseworks
Please
could
I
get
a
confirmation
of
the
extension
due
date
too
?
Also
does
the
Covid
extensions
apply
ontop
of
this
?
Hopefully
I
wo
nt
need
it
as
I
’m
close
to
finishing
both
,
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
some
extra
time
to
review
both
without
the
stress
of
exams
at
the
same
time
.
Additionally
,
I
wish
to
appeal
a
grade
from
last
term
but
I
have
n’t
been
able
to
as
it
has
n’t
been
released
on
system-
could
someone
tell
me
why
this
is
?
And
when
I
’ll
be
able
to
?
Thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give
.
Hi
Karlotte
,
Sorry
to
be
annoying
I
’ve
watched
the
lectures
and
webinars
probably
about
11
times
over
the
weekend
and
I
have
discovered
the
three
things
you
mentioned
,
used
to
support
political
activities
,
used
as
a
substitute
or
used
innovatively
.
Reviewing
the
webinar
was
helpful
too
as
it
was
the
first
time
I
mentioned
organisation
so
your
comments
were
helpful
.
I
’ve
read
numerous
research
papers
too
that
I
can
use
,
but
I
’m
struggling
to
use
my
organisation
case
study
as
i
’m
unsure
how
it
relates
to
the
three
things
.
Also
...
do
I
mention
the
three
things
?
Also
,
I
do
n’t
quite
understand
the
point
about
evaluating
the
research
rather
than
evaluating
the
question
...
I
’ve
gotten
a
bit
lost
and
feel
like
I
need
to
start
my
essay
from
scratch-
or
even
change
question
which
I
’m
hesitant
to
do
as
I
’m
really
interested
in
topic
.
I
started
to
redraft
my
essay
but
I
feel
that
i
’ve
gotten
myself
too
confused
that
it
really
does
not
read
well
at
all
Thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give-
I
’m
sorry
if
my
confusion
is
getting
repetitive
.
Elihu
,
I
received
the
class
email
about
module
4469
,
and
have
a
personal
query
My
first
workshop
appears
to
be
on
the
666
of
December
,
with
you
,
but
on
the
9428
-
1548
of
October
I
’m
leaving
Seattle
for
the
event
.
Is
there
any
way
that
I
could
somehow
switch
groups
,
or
do
anything
to
avoid
losing
marks
for
the
first
workshop
?
I
spoke
to
organisation
and
they
told
me
to
email
you
,
and
request
an
authorised
leave
of
absence
if
nothing
can
be
arranged
.
As
i
'll
be
missing
the
first
tutorial
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
contact
my
group
members
to
arrange
something
with
them
as
suggested
in
the
module
announcements
.
Sorry
to
be
a
bother
,
but
thank
you
for
any
help
you
can
give
!

Great
,
thank
you

Hi
Federica
,
I
just
tried
to
submit
my
portfolio
for
the
module
.
I
’ve
tried
to
do
this
on
three
different
browsers
now
,
but
once
accepting
the
declaration
,
no
form
pops
up
for
me
to
submit
my
work
.
I
was
just
wondering
if
the
submission
page
has
been
made
public
yet
or
whether
I
’m
the
only
one
that
’s
having
this
issue
?
Thank
you

Searching
for

opportunities
is
n’t
the
most
ideal
during
a
pandemic
,
but
hopefully
i
’ll

Understandable

better
too

’m

I
remember
the

For

revision
guide
was
honestly
so
helpful
for
me

I
have
mine

so
if
it
would
be
of
use
to
you

you
’re
welcome
to
have
it-
it
covers
the

content
as

Regarding
the

essay
questions

I
always
found

Hi
Aleecia
,
Thanks
again
for
meeting
me
on
Monday
,
your
feedback
was
really
helpful
!
I
’ve
spent
the
weekend
doing
Section
2
,
I
found
it
hard
to
write
what
I
wanted
to
with
the
word
count
I
was
also
wondering
,
I
get
extra
time
in
exams
,
how
would
this
work
with
the
online
exams
this
year
?
Or
would
it
not
apply
at
all
?
Kind
regards
.
Hi
Horatia
,
I
think
I
’ve
nearly
finished
my
essay
,
just
have
to
cut
out
200
words
...
I
was
just
wondering
how
we
should
approach
the
layout

Would
you
want
us
to
write
"
section
1
,
2
,
3
"
etc
or
is
it
okay
with
just
headings
such
as
"
topic
"
Also
,
do
you
have
a
limit
on
references
?
I
appear
to
have
46
and
I
’m
worried
it
’s
too
much
?
Thank
you
.
ill
have
a
check
now
,
I
assumed
they
all
started
off
low
!
?
Can
you
remember
when
we
moved
into
the
house
?
too
!
Will
update
you
on
everything
on
the
call
-
it
will
be
easier
than
typing
it
out
!
Just
having
a
meeting
with
the
surgeon
now
and
then
with
a
potential
new
flat

Dear
Moe
,
I
am
on
my
placement
year
of
course
.
Hi
Gerry
,
Can
you
please
remove
me
from
this
mailing
list
,
I
do
not
study
course
Good
Afternoon
,
I
saw
today
that
final
year
modules
have
become
available
for
selection
and
I
am
considering
taking
intermediate
Mandarin
.
However
,
I
would
like
to
better
understand
the
level
required
first
before
making
my
decision
.
I
unfortunately
have
no
English
qualifications
,
but
have
started
studying
the
language
whilst
on
my
placement
and
living
in
the
country
this
year
.
I
am
aiming
to
complete
my
A1
exam
before
coming
back
to
University
.
I
understand
that
intermediate
would
be
a
step
up
from
this
,
but
in
your
experience
,
do
you
think
its
possible
?
Or
would
you
advise
against
taking
it
?
Having
said
this
,
would
I
even
be
accepted
for
the
course
with
no
qualifications
?
Would
my
year
living
here
help
me
to
negotiate
a
place
?
Looking
forward
to
hearing
your
thoughts
,
Best
wishes
,
.
Good
Evening
,
Please
disregard
my
previous
email
,
my
total
word
count
was
out
by
2
words
and
I
understand
this
is
important
.
This
has
been
corrected
on
this
attachment
and
on
the
organisation
submission
page
.
My
apologies
for
any
inconvenience
this
may
cause
.
Kind
regards
,

Hi
Amandy
,
I
sent
him
a
message
on
Instagram
this
afternoon
,
as
soon
as
I
’d
spotted
that
I
’d
missed
the
deadline
!
Around
430
Yes
I
have
spoken
to
the
current
committee
about
this
.
Is
there
anything
else
you
’d
like
me
to
do
to
help
with
this
?
😊
Kind
regards
.
Good
Afternoon
,
Firstly
,
my
apologies
for
not
submitting
this
in
the
proper
way
and
for
being
delayed
!
I
am
on
placement
abroad
and
very
much
out
of
the
loop
so
I
only
found
out
about
the
opportunity
once
it
was
too
late
.
Meggie
said
that
I
should
be
able
to
submit
my
application
this
way
given
the
circumstances
,
so
please
see
below
for
my
manifesto
for
President
of
society
.
copied_text
Egbert
,
My
placement
is
approved
,
do
I
still
need
to
complete
this
form
?
Its
been
so
long
since
the
approval
,
I
ca
n’t
remember
if
I
have
already
done
this
!
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Devon
,
Yes
I
would
be
happy
to
have
a
call
with
you
to
discuss
the
project
,
although
I
must
admit
that
I
have
n’t
yet
started
it
due
to
other
study
commitments
and
work
.
Hopefully
this
talk
will
help
me
to
get
the
ball
rolling
with
it
a
bit
!
I
am
available
all
of
next
week
after
4
pm
,
let
me
know
what
day
suits
you
best
Best
wishes

Hi
Lydie
,
No
problem
,
I
will
take
a
look
into
this
prior
to
our
meeting
on
Sunday
.
In
regards
to
timings
,
4
works
for
me
too
if
you
would
prefer
.
Good
Evening
,
I
am
just
beginning
my
placement
year
project
with
organisation
and
am
concerned
to
see
that
there
is
also
a
section
for
organisation
placement
assessment
on
my
system
account
.
Can
you
please
confirm
that
I
am
not
expected
to
do
both
?
I
have
limited
time
around
work
anyway
so
committing
to
both
of
these
when
other
students
only
have
to
do
one
would
be
very
intensive
and
impractical
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
,
.

Hi
Emelda
,
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
meet
with
me
today
!
As
discussed
,
I
have
attached
my
statement
of
motivation
.
Let
me
know
if
it
requires
any
more
work
and
I
will
get
this
sorted
asap
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Grady
,
Thanks
for
the
reminder
!
I
have
completed
the
test
and
have
the
form
,
currently
just
trying
to
come
up
with
an
idea
for
the
project
outline
.
I
should
have
no
problems
meeting
the
deadline
though
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Zorana
,
Yes
,
I
think
that
would
be
helpful
.
Additionally
,
when
would
you
like
me
to
setup
a
meeting
between
you
and
my
manager
at
business
?
Best
wishes

Trip
to
Helsinki
2nd
-
4th
September
You
will
be
staying
in
the
Clarion
Hotel
Helsinki
on
the
seafront
,
it
will
be
110EURnight
.
There
are
lots
of
amenities
nearby
,
you
will
be
able
to
have
coffee
and
breakfast
at
the
Kaffa
Roastery
,
just
a
short
distance
from
the
hotel
.
It
is
located
on
29
Pursiniehenkatu
00150
.
For
the
evening
,
I
would
recommend
the
Kostan
Molija
restaurant
for
a
traditional
Finnish
buffet
,
there
are
choices
of
local
salads
,
breads
,
pastries
and
stew
.
They
also
offer
local
cocktails
.
This
restaurant
is
located
on
Hietalahdenkatu
14
,
00180
.
If
you
have
free
time
in
the
day
then
you
should
visit
the
Helsinki
city
museum
to
find
out
more
about
the
history
of
the
area
.
You
could
also
visit
the
Heureka
souvenir
shop
on
Urho
Kekkosen
Katu
1
,
00100
if
you
wanted
to
bring
anything
back
with
you
after
your
trip
.
Finally
,
I
would
suggest
you
visit
the
Koko
Jazz
club
for
some
live
music
in
the
evenings
,
this
will
be
on
Hameentie
3
,
00530
.
Let
me
know
if
this
works
for
you
and
if
you
would
like
me
to
continue
with
more
research
on
the
area
All
the
best
,
Luke
Amory
,
Just
following
up
my
previous
email
,
are
you
available
to
meet
at
all
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hello
Tani
,
I
am
contacting
you
as
I
've
had
real
difficulty
with
my
mentor
this
year
and
was
interested
to
know
if
I
could
be
setup
with
another
?
I
was
excited
to
meet
with
him
as
his
role
seemed
like
a
very
good
match
for
my
aspirations
but
unfortunately
I
have
had
no
luck
.
He
took
a
very
long
time
to
return
my
emails
initially
and
has
then
cancelled
on
our
first
meet
twice
,
both
with
minimal
notice
,
one
of
which
was
less
than
12hours
.
I
have
tried
to
get
in
contact
with
him
this
term
but
have
not
had
a
response
in
a
week
and
have
lost
all
faith
at
this
point
!
I
understand
if
you
are
unable
to
arrange
another
mentor
at
this
late
stage
,
but
I
just
wanted
it
known
that
we
still
have
not
met
!
Somewhat
frustrated
that
he
has
gone
to
the
effort
of
updating
his
LinkedIn
profile
with
his
mentor
role
but
has
not
yet
met
with
me
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Gere
,
Brilliant
,
Tuesday
works
best
for
me
.
I
'll
come

after
my

-
12
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
Shelton
,
That
would
be
brilliant
if
possible
,
thank
you
!
My
main
interests
are
topic
,
topic
and
topic
.
In
terms
of
future
roles
,
I
am
hoping
to
secure
a
position
within
those
fields
or
in
a
general
business
role
in
a
managerial
capacity
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Nadean
,
Apologies
for
my
delay
in
getting
back
to
you
,
I
have
been
out
of
the
country
!
Thank
you
so
much
for
looking
into
this
for
me
.
Yes
,
I
believe
that
all
of
those
would
be
well
suited
to
me
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Remington
,
Membership
now
all
sorted
-
left
it
very
late
haha
!
Would
you
be
able
to
confirm
my
status
as
a
committee
member
so
that
I
can
have
access
to
the
tools
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Forrester
,
That
's
brilliant
news
,
thank
you
for
arranging
this
-
I
really
appreciate
it
!
I
will
reach
out
to
Diamond
now
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Henri
,
Thank
you
for
the
tips
,
I
have
made
these
changes
.
Please
accept
the
attached
as
my
final
submission
.
I
have
also
added
it
onto
the
organisation
submissions
page
,
but
I
understand
the
final
submission
should
be
sent
to
email_address
so
I
have
included
them
in
this
email
also
.
Please
let
me
know
if
there
are
any
problems
with
this
Kind
regards
,
.
Dear
Wait
,
I
am
happy
to
setup
a
meeting
between
you
both
,
I
will
check
her
availability
.
Do
I
remember
rightly
that
you
said
you
would
prefer
to
do
the
meeting
without
me
?
When
you
say
discuss
how
things
went
,
are
you
expecting
me
to
have
already
completed
the
presentation
?
Unfortunately
,
I
have
not
yet
got
to
this
stage
,
but
I
have
taken
the
week
off
work
this
week
to
tackle
the
task
so
should
be
much
further
along
by
then
!
Perhaps
if
you
hope
hoping
to
discuss
the
presentation
then
we
should
postpone
the
meeting
?
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
all
,
Attached
is
the
meeting
invite
for
this
evening
,
looking
forward
to
catching
up
then
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Cinda
,
I
have
been
in
contact
with
my
manager
Theresa
-
Marie
and
she
said
that
she
has
availability
9.30
–
10.20am
on
Thursday
6096
June
,
does
this
work
for
you
?
If
so
,
I
think
it
may
be
easier
for
you
to
invite
her
to
a
Teams
meeting
,
as
I
am
not
sure
if
you
will
both
have
full
access
if
I
set
it
up
!
Her
email
is

Hi
Augusta
,
Sorry
if
I
was
unclear
,
I
have
still
yet
to
complete
one
module
from
the
level
four
,
but
I
believe
I
have
the
choice
whether
to
go
with
module
,
or
specialise
in
the
topic
module
–
module
.
It
was
these
two
that
I
was
hoping
to
see
the
specifications
for
if
possible
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Carena
,
Thank
you
for
the
information
and
your
quick
response
.
Would
you
be
able
to
send
the
questions
for
these
over
or
module
overviews
so
I
can
find
out
more
detail
about
each
before
deciding
which
to
pursue
?
Unfortunately
,
I
ca
n’t
find
them
online
Kind
regards
,
.
aged
to
get
the
post
today
so
the
firestick
has
arrived
🎉
Thanks
for
posting
it
x
Yeah
no
problems
there!x
I
'm
bloody
glad
I
did
n't
go
in
at
£
8hour
,
he
agreed
to
4hrsweek
at
£
25hr
😂
🥳
That
s
odd
,
I
have
nt
ordered
one
🤔
barely
ever
use
that
account
!
Will
check
what
s
going
on
with
my
Internet
banking
x
No
there
s
nothing
about
it
on
my
account
,
bizarre
!
What
does
the
letter
say?x
Ah
you
might
be
right
there
,
my
current
one
runs
out
next
month
😱
😂
could
you
send
it
up
please
?
I
doubt
I
'll
use
it
any
time
soon
but
probably
better
to
have
it
just
in
case
!
I
'll
transfer
you
some
money
for
this
and
the
firestick
post
!
X
Gilly
,
No
worries
,
have
booked
one
for
3
pm

see
you
tomorrow
!
Many
thanks

Hi
Yank
,
I
understand
where
you
're
coming
from
and
apologise
if
I
've
approached
this
in
the
wrong
way
.
I
was
initially
just
looking
to
secure
any
placement
in
the
right
industry
as
I
knew
there
was
lots
of
competition
,
I
had
n't
given
much
consideration
to
pay
.
I
would
be
more
than
prepared
to
take
this
placement
as
I
think
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
,
but
I
'd
still
like
to
keep
my
options
open
as
I
am
waiting
to
hear
back
from
a
number
of
applications
.
Unfortunately
I
have
already
signed
a
contract
,
I
did
so
on
the
basis
that
I
could
not
keep
them
waiting
and
did
not
want
to
give
up
the
opportunity
in
case
I
do
n't
get
any
other
responses
.
I
had
n't
thought
about
the
repercussions
for
the
university
's
reputation
,
I
apologise
if
this
has
a
negative
impact
!
Would
it
be
easier
to
delay
the
paperwork
on
the
uni
's
side
until
I
've
heard
back
from
all
of
my
applications
?
Regards
,

Hello
,
I
am
emailling
to
let
you
know
that
I
have
secured
myself
an
international
placement
starting
this
summer
.
I
have
been
offered
a
job_title
internship
with
organisation
.
I
do
intend
to
keep
searching
for
another
though
as
this
position
does
not
offer
a
very
substantial
salary
.
How
does
this
work
your
end
if
I
'm
able
to
arrange
a
more
suitable
placement
?
Is
it
easy
enough
to
change
the
paperwork
?
Are
there
any
updates
on
the
likelihood
of
university
covering
the
Erasmus
grant
if
it
is
lost
through
brexit
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Tory
,
That
's
a
shame
but
I
understand
,
we
left
it
too
late
to
arrange
it
last
term
!
Would
be
good
to
meet
as
I
'd
also
like
to
ask
you
about
the
organisation
requirements
for
another
event
I
'd
like
to
run
.
When
works
best
for
you
?
I
'm
in
the
organisation
anyway
around
4
pm
today
if
that
suits
?
If
not
,
I
'm
fairly
flexible
at
the
moment
,
do
n't
have
much
of
a
social
life
during
the
exam
period!
😂
Just
have
to
avoid
6896
,
9735
,
310
and
9795
because
of
exams
.
Cheers
,
.
Robenia
,
Apologies
for
wasting
your
time
,
my
groupmate
was
able
to
find
backups
of
the
photos
in
the
cloud
from
his
phone
so
we
have
a
solution
!
Thank
you
anyway
.
Best
wishes

Good
Afternoon
Maureen
,
Our
group
but
waiting
for
them
to
be
announced
for
now
.
I
have
also
created
slides
for
team
working
and
reflection
on
learning
-
worth
25
%
each
.
I
have
put
all
the
info
from
the
mark
scheme
on
there
as
generic
bullet
points
so
we
know
what
to
talk
about
but
I
have
n't
written
anything
yet
,
was
hoping
we
could
discuss
this
as
a
group
as
its
such
a
big
element
.
Let
me
know
what
you
think
of
the
design
too
,
was
procrastinating
to
fuck
and
spend
a
little
while
on
it
lol
,
would
be
blessed
if
we
could
keep
it
similar
for
the
final
piece
so
my
work
was
n't
for
nothing
😂
Won't
be
offended
if
you
can
improve
it
though
.
Can
you
reply
to
email_address
as
I
do
n't
really
check
this
one
!
Safe

Dear
Raj
,
I
am
struggling
to
find
much
on
this
module
at
all
-
besides
the
system
page
.
As
it
has
no
announcements
and
I
have
not
received
any
communications
about
it
,
I
almost
forgot
I
had
it
!
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
that
this
module
is
still
running
as
previously
with
the
proposed
submission
deadline
of
the
6644
of
this
month
?
If
so
,
I
will
make
a
start
with
it
ASAP
!
It
does
not
seem
like
the
system
page
is
setup
to
accept
submissions
,
how
should
I
submit
my
work
when
finished
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Verena
,
I
have
edited
the
document
and
to
meet
objective
3
but
I
can
see
we
are
only
allowed
to
use
two
marketing
tools
.
Should
I
pursue
this
and
replace
an
existing
strategy
or
simply
cut
this
objective
and
focus
on
what
I
have
already
?
Sorry
for
the
lengthy
email
,
I
hope
that
this
is
allowed
!
Many
thanks
,
.
Maure
,
That
's
brilliant
,
thank
you
for
finding
the
time
for
us
,
how
is
1.15pm
for
you
?
Where
can
we
find
your
office
?
Best
wishes

Hi
Jehu
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
so
quickly
,
I
really
appreciate
it
.
The
presentation
is
during
week
24
as
this
is
only
3
days
earlier
than
planned
.
This
would
allow
us
to
all
go
on
our
trip
and
would
be
a
fantastic
option
for
us
.
I
understand
this
would
not
be
easy
to
arrange
and
I
apologise
for
the
inconvenience
,
but
I
believe
the
alternative
is
much
more
difficult
and
costly
!
Alternatively
,
if
needs
be
we
can
cut
our
trip
short
and
fund
travel
back
to
the
UK
for
our
members
so
we
could
be
available
on
Wednesday
7199
.
This
would
have
significant
financial
implications
for
us
so
would
not
be
ideal
but
is
a
possibility
if
the
presentations
can
be
arranged
on
that
date
.
Another
option
we
have
considered
was
sending
in
videos
of
us
presenting
,
I
am
not
sure
how
well
this
works
with
the
exam
regulations
though
.
Perhaps
this
is
something
we
could
discuss
in
the
meeting
.
I
have
had
a
look
at
system
and
have
seen
that
you
are
available
on
Monday
,
due
to
the
time
constraints
,
do
you
have
any
availability
sooner
?
If
not
,
I
will
book
in
that
session
this
evening
.
Thanks
again
for
your
time
,
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
soon
,
Kind
regards
,
.
﻿Dear
Darsie
,
I
recently
attended
a
meeting
with
Jessie
regarding
the
module
module
and
the
presentation
aspect
of
the
assessment
.
This
presentation
clashes
with
a
trip
that
society
has
planned
and
I
was
hoping
we
could
discuss
the
possibility
of
moving
the
assessment
dates
as
this
is
a
substantial
issue
for
us
and
our
members
.
Tiffi
suggested
that
it
might
be
possible
but
said
that
we
should
speak
to
you
about
it
.
Are
you
available
for
a
meeting
at
all
this
week
?
The
deadline
for
payment
for
our
trip
is
fast
-
approaching
so
I
'd
really
appreciate
it
if
we
could
meet
as
soon
as
possible
to
give
our
members
as
much
time
as
we
can
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Social
Secretary

I

Was

Haha

the
most
of

again!x
Its

Haha

No

That

this
queue

😂
😭
STILL
queuing
,
will
try
my
best
to
be
quick
once
i

through
!
Hey
Dad
!
Signed
up
to
an
online
bank
that
's
going
to
send
me
out
a
bank
card
.
I
do
n't
need
it
anytime
soon
so
could
you
just
put
it
in
the
top
of
my
wardrobe
please
😊
It
had
another
covid
test
to
try
to
get
the
all
clear
for
seeing
Nonna
at
Christmas
and
enroute
back
now
,
I
will
double
check
what
options
there
are
when
i
m

😊
Hey
Dad
!
Do
I
still
have
my
Amazon
Firestick
plugged
into
the
telly
in
my
room
?
Ca

All

Los
Angelos

Getting

is
proving
to
be
a
nightmare
,
very
expensive
and
very
complicated
😔
called
business
,
its
a
little
one
on
the
way
to
building
!
Ah
blessed
,
that
will
be
so
nice
to
have
your
own
place
!
Yeah
for
sure
,
we
will
be
in
there
daily
I
can
imagine
so
just
let
me
know
when
😂
Blessed
!
I
m
not
sure
I
've
actually
been
to
building
before
,
is
it
far
from
campus?x
Hey
Marie
!
I
decided
to
run
for
president
of
society
next
year
,
I
want
to
make
the
final
year
one
to
remember
!
Non
-
club
members
can
vote
for
£
1
and
it
would
mean
the
world
to
me
if
I
could
have
your
support
☺
️
Blythe
,
Are
there
any
Wednesdays
still
available
this
semester
for
society
to
book
in
an
event
?
Happy
to
have
a
meeting
with
you
to
discuss
plans
so
its
better
organised
this
time
!
Best
wishes

Hello
Madeline
,
I
received
my
mark
for
the
module
presentation
assessment
over
Christmas
and
I
must
admit
,
I
was
quite
disappointed
!
Apologies
for
the
delay
in
bringing
this
up
,
thought
it
was
best
to
wait
until
I
was
back
at
university
.
After
looking
through
the
feedback
provided
I
'm
left
quite
confused
on
how
my
grade
was
decided
.
There
seems
to
be
lots
of
feedback
on
each
slide
which
would
usually
be
great
,
but
I
was
under
the
impression
that
we
were
being
marked
solely
on
our
response
to
the
feedback
i.e.
critical
reflection
?
Or
were
we
also
meant
to
change
the
rest
of
the
slides
following
the
presentation
?
I
found
the
task
very
difficult
as
we
were
given
such
positive
feedback
on
our
presentation
,
I
did
n't
feel
like
I
had
very
much
to
work
with
for
this
task
!
I
understand
all
of
your
negative
points
raised
about
our
main
slides
,
but
as
we
did
not
receive
that
feedback
at
the
time
,
I
'm
unsure
of
how
I
was
meant
to
make
any
changes
to
that
for
my
submission
.
Following
this
,
you
made
comments
about
me
not
changing
the
text
-
heavy
slides
for
my
submission
.
I
understand
its
a
bit
of
an
eye
-
sore
but
I
saw
no
other
way
of
getting
all
the
information
we
spoke
about
in
our
presentation
onto
the
limited
number
of
slides
.
Were
we
meant
to
have
left
them
as
bullet
points
without
the
key
info
when
submitting
?
Sorry
for
all
of
the
questions
-
just
hoping
to
better
understand
the
rationale
behind
the
marking
.
Many
thanks
,
.

Hi
Alison
,
Yes
this
is
correct
,
I
have
been
offered
a
position
with
organisation
.
However
,
I
would
like
to
hold
off
on
the
paperwork
on
the
university
's
side
for
now
if
possible
.
I
had
a
meeting
with
Leslie
yesterday
and
we
decided
that
that
was
the
best
course
of
action
for
now
as
I
am
still
waiting
to
hear
back
from
a
number
of
other
places
.
We
planned
to
meet
again
next
month
when
I
can
be
more
certain
of
where
I
'm
going
to
be
headed
!
Will
keep
you
in
the
loop
!
Best
wishes
,
.
ing
said
that
,
I
do
nt
seem
to
have
your
bank
details
anymore
🤔
can
you
send
them
over?x
Yeah
I
think
coming
back
sooner
rather
than
later
is
a
safe
bet
as
she
may
be
home
as
early
as
tomorrow
morning
-
although
they
keep
delaying
things
.
Let
me
know
when
works
for
you!xx
I
think
given
the
current
situation
,
a
test
would
be
very
wise
.
I
have
managed
to
book
one
in
for
11
tomorrow
morning
so
should
have
results
by
12
😊
let
me
know
when
works
best
for
you
xx
Thank
you
Dad
!
I
will
do
xx
Test
done
,
will
let
you
know
as
soon
as
possible
😊
Dear
Eugene
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
taking
the
time
to
review
and
make
an
exception
for
my
placement
,
I
am
immensely
grateful
!
I
accept
the
risks
listed
and
understand
the
actions
I
must
take
.
The
only
query
I
have
is
of
my
placement
tutor
,
I
was
not
aware
I
had
one
!
?
How
would
I
go
about
finding
out
whom
this
is
so
I
may
make
contact
with
them
?
Thanks
again
and
best
wishes
,
.
Hello
,
I
filled
all
of
these
forms
in
when
I
first
secured
the
placement
–
a
good
few
months
back
now
!
Am
I
expected
to
fill
these
in
again
?
.
Good
Evening
,
Thank
you
for
your
message
,
it
is
great
to
hear
that
I
’m
eligible
for
the
Erasmus
funding
.
I
have
filled
in
the
form
as
requested
and
attached
it
to
this
email
.
Let
me
know
if
you
need
anything
else
from
me
and
I
will
do
my
best
to
get
it
back
to
you
as
quickly
as
possible
!
Many
thanks
.
Hello
,
I
uploaded
these
previously
to
system
so
will
send
them
to
you
directly
to
avoid
any
more
confusion
!
I
guess
there
must
have
been
some
issues
when
the
placement
was
initially
cancelled
on
your
end
!
?
Let
me
know
if
this
is
okay
.
Thanks
.
This
should
be
everything
you
need
.
Please
let
me
know
if
anything
else
comes
up
.
Many
thanks
Hello
,
I
must
admit
that
I
am
finding
this
very
difficult
at
the
moment
.
Understandably
,
coronavirus
has
thrown
everything
up
into
the
air
and
caused
lots
of
confusion
,
disrupting
my
flights
and
all
of
my
paperwork
.
However
,
having
now
filled
in
all
of
your
requested
forms
twice
and
pestering
my
employer
almost
daily
to
satisfy
your
requirements
,
I
would
ask
that
you
offer
me
some
leeway
as
the
many
requests
have
only
made
this
more
difficult
for
me
.
I
want
to
make
a
good
first
impression
with
my
employer
and
it
has
been
hard
to
maintain
that
with
the
university
trying
to
cancel
my
placement
and
me
constantly
messaging
business
with
questions
and
updates
.
I
am
concerned
I
am
being
made
to
look
reliant
on
help
and
that
it
will
start
me
off
in
a
poor
way
with
my
new
role
.
The
document
I
sent
over
to
you
was
exactly
what
was
sent
to
me
when
I
asked
business
for
a
job
description
.
It
is
all
that
myself
and
the
employer
have
agreed
upon
about
the
day
-
to
-
day
runnings
of
the
job
,
even
I
do
n’t
know
anymore
than
that
and
it
will
be
me
doing
it
!
Myself
and
the
employer
are
content
that
the
job
description
under
the
‘
role
’
section
on
that
document
is
more
than
satisfactory
.
If
you
truly
want
to
dispute
the
definitions
between
a
role
description
and
a
job
description
then
of
course
,
I
will
have
to
message
my
employer
again
.
I
would
just
like
you
to
understand
how
unprofessional
I
am
being
made
to
look
and
how
frustrating
it
is
for
all
parties
involved
.
Regards
,
.
Dad
!
Are
you
in
Huntington
at
all
today
?
😊
I
think
Ikey
was
talking
about
going
down
to
East
Setauket
early
this
afternoon
but
I
do
nt
think
it
was
quite
that
early
,
I
'll
get
back
to
you
asap
!
Is
there
any
chance
you
're
available
later
on
?
I
have
to
try
and
fit
a
meeting
in
with
my
boss
first
and
MumNeale
are
busy
this
morning
.
It
would
be
greatly
appreciated
!
I
think
Kelcey
is
in
Huntington
around
2
,
depends
on
what
you
re
doing
in
Philadelphia
really
!
Bless
you
,
I
just
did
nt
want
to
make
you
drive
back
and
forth
!
yve
just
straight
up
stopped
reporting
the
cases
in
english
now
because
its
bad
publicity
lol
so
no
,
I
do
nt
have
high
hopes
😂
Ah
that
s
good
news
!
I
m
so
excited
for
next
year
,
it
's
got
ta
be
incredible
after
this
year
😅
Damn
I
did
it
again
I
'm
sorry
,
clearly
drunk
too
often
😂
😭
Yeah
it
's
fucked
,
so
just
got
to
try
learn
Arabic
to
understand
it
,
or
just
keep
my
fingers
crossed
that
it
gets
better
lol
Ah
yeah
I
fully
get
that
,
there
has
been
so
much
false
hope
throughout
this
whole
thing
,
I
remember
us
all
thinking
we
were
out
of
this
when
that
eat
out
to
help
out
scheme
was
going
on
🙃
But
having
said
that
,
I
am
confident
that
no
matter
the
situation
,
next
year
will
have
to
be
better
than
this
year
-
not
wishing
to
tempt
fate
or
anything
but
genuinely
ca
n't
see
how
it
could
be
any
worse
😂
spent
the
whole
damn
year
inside
a
ill
have
to
get
practicing
that
!
Ride
was
okay
,
I
was
nt
very
good
😂
Hey
Dad
,
my
laptop
has
crashed
today
,
think
I
've
got
a
virus
on
it
which
is
frustrating
as
I
have
all
the
antivirus
software
.
Can
you
put
me
in
touch
with
your
IT
man
please
?
Its
all
backed
up
so
should
be
restorable
!
Ah
ignore
that
,
I
have
fixed
it
😂
😂
Hey
Dad
,
have
you
got
an
opportunity
to
drop
that
off
post
over
this
week
please
?
Also
i
think
I
have
some
shoes
in
the
wardrobe
,
some
nikes
?
No
problem
,
sounds
good
:)
Wellies
would
be
a
good
shout
for
tomorrow
,
it
can
be
pretty
muddy
down
the
yard
with
this
weather
!
Ill
try
grab
some
carrots
from
the
village
shop
for
the
horses
!
Dear
Jyoti
,
The
date
is
on
system
yes
but
,
from
what
I
can
see
,
the
submission
page
has
no
actual
way
of
submitting
a
piece
of
work
,
just
generic
information
on
how
I
would
submit
?
A
friend
of
mine
told
me
about
his
last
year
and
I
would
like
to
know
if
I
can
apply
for
that
also
and
how
I
might
go
about
doing
so
?
Many
thanks
,
.
students
!
?
Man
no
wonder
you
had
to
be
there
so
early
,
would
be
very
obvious
if
you
skipped
it
;)
xx
I
could
n't
deal
with
that
kind
of
pressure
every
week
jeez
,
my
attendance
this
year
was
like
10%
😂
x
That
s
good
to
hear
!
What
is
it
you
re
doing
now?xx
That
s
fair
enough
,
sounds
very
good
!
How
is
your
French
coming
along
?
That
will
be
amazing
,
fingers
crossed
all
is
back
to
normal
by
then
😅
Its
been
fantastic
thank
you
,
only
just
starting
to
get
into
work
really
but
the
social
side
is
brilliant
haha
,
have
met
lots
of
lovely
people
!
Xx
Mattias
,
I
have
attached
the
completed
form
as
best
I
can
but
unfortunately
the
office
’s
scanner
is
pretty
faulty
so
its
come
out
quite
wonky
!
However
all
the
information
requested
is

Hi
there
,
I
am
currently
on
placement
out
in
Dallas
in
Russia
,
working
for
business
.
I
was
hoping
you
could
clarify
what
cover
I
have
in
terms
of
health
insurance
from
the
university
?
My
Erasmus
learner
agreement
suggests
that
you
cover
me
whilst
travelling
to
and
from
work
and
whilst
I
'm
in
the
office
,
but
country_adj
law
dictates
that
I
must
have
health
insurance
in
order
to
visit
a
doctor
.
I
was
hoping
you
could
send
me
over
the
details
of
any
insurance
that
I
may
be
covered
by
to
see
if
I
can
get
a
doctor
's
appointment
with
this
-
buying
additional
health
insurance
will
cost
me
15
%
of
my
salary
which
would
n't
be
great
!
Would
appreciate
a
quick
response
on
this
if
possible
as
I
do
n't
think
it
is
wise
for
me
to
be
without
health
insurance
during
the
current
pandemic
,
so
if
I
need
to
buy
some
-
please
let
me
know
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Dear
Morty
,
Please
remove
me
from
this
mailing
list
.
I
am
receiving
many
emails
from
you
all
starting
"
First
years
"
or
"
Final
years
"
I
am
on
my
placement
and
none
of
these
apply
to
me
.
I
did
not
receive
any
such
emails
when
I
was
in
previous
years
,
so
it
is
quite
frustrating
to
be
receiving
so
many
that
do
n’t
apply
to
me
.
Regards
,
.
Hi
Dorit
,
Thanks
for
reaching
out
,
I
can
confirm
that
I
am
unaffected
by
this
and
all
is
well
!
I
appreciate
the
message
though
.
Many
thanks

Dear
Mareah
,
Thank
you
for
reaching
out
to
me
and
my
apologies
for
the
delay
in
my
response
.
It
has
been
a
busy
time
trying
to
navigate
Brexit
changes
and
covid
restrictions
whilst
working
abroad
!
I
will
reach
out
to
you
ifwhen
I
need
some
guidance
.
Many
thanks
,

damn
what
s
the
sitch
in
Brazil
?
That
does
nt
sound
good
😓
I
suppose
you
can
just
go
to
wherever
is
open
though
!
🎉
Ah
that
's
a
shame
!
Very
good
news
that
s
there
's
0
deaths
though
,
I
guess
you
ca
n't
have
both
😓
😅
I
'm
the
complete
opposite
haha
,
I
miss
the
pub
so
much
😂
Not
fussed
if
clubs
do
n't
reopen
for
years
but
summer
in
a
beer
garden
is
needed!x
Ah
man
that
just
sounds
perfect
,
would
do
anything
for
a
pint
and
a
game
of
pool
rn!
😅
Enjoy
the
sun
...
In
Mexico
?
That
s
a
bit
optimistic
is
nt
it

at
a
low
cost
for
a
small
monthly
subscription
.
Car

are
owned
by
Enterprise
who
provide
car
rentals
,
sharing
and
sales
across
8,000
locations
worldwide
.
Enterprise
Car
Club
are
looking
to
expand
operations
and
target
the
student
demographic
of
Birmingham
.
This
plan
offers
solutions
for
the
next
12
months
to
identify
,
target
and
market
to
the
chosen
demographic
,
whilst
evaluating
the
individual
methods
and
their
collective
effects
.
This
marketing
plan
aims
to
boost
brand
awareness
and
grow
the
business
and
operations
within
Birmingham
.
Evaluation
of
market
segment
With
81,000
students
in
Birmingham
as
students
remain
in
the
city
and
will
require
transport
to
and
from
their
exams
and
across
the
city
to
other
locations
such
as
food
shops
.
Posters
will
feature
in
key
locations
across
the
city
where
individuals
may
need
transport
such
as
the
student
union
,
student
accommodation
,
supermarkets
and
shopping
centres
.
As
posters
are
relatively
inexpensive
,
they
can
run
continuously
,
attracting
custom
throughout
the
year
.
For
example
,
the
summer
months
and
December
are
usually
quiet
for
the
student
population
,
but
due
to
school
holidays
and
locals
Christmas
shopping
,
footfall
will
remain
consistent
throughout
the
year
.
Although
this
is
n’t
our
target
market
,
continuing
advertising
throughout
the
year
will
help
to
ensure
a
consistent
revenue
stream
.
Good
Afternoon
,
The
lady
that
I
have
been
on

with
at

Good
Afternoon
,
I
sent
off
my

form
as
requested
back
in
early
September
and
received
an

have
not

Just
wanted
to
confirm
whether
I
have
been
approved
for
this
and
when
I
can
expect
the
first

?
Many

Hello
,
I
received
an
email
about
my
Erasmus
grant
and
so
went
to
check
my
placement
details
on
system
but
could
n’t
find
them
.
I
began
filling
in
these
details
and
then
realised
they
were
all
already
on
there
!
Sorry
for
causing
any
confusion
,
any
chance
the
one
that
is
half
filled
-
in
could
be
removed
please
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Aloisia
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
so
quickly
!
Yes
I
was
unsure
what
to
put
for
this
as
I
am
here
in
Mexico
for
a
year
so
I
thought
that
would
count
as
home
now
!
?
No
problem
,
I
have
attached
the
completed
form
again
with
my
parent
’s
home
address
which
is
where
I
stay
when
not
at
uni
or
on
placement
!
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Ventura
,
Thank
you
for
that
–
I
have
now
filled
in
most
of
the
form
.
Can
you
tell
me
what
is
meant
be
monitoring
and
evaluation
plans
please
?
Also
,
I
presume
the
during
and
after
mobility
sections
do
n’t
need
to
be
filled
in
now
?
Once
these
details
are
clarified
,
I
will
get
the
form
sent
off
for
completion
by
my
employer
ASAP
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Jeremiah
,
What
is
the
learning
agreement
?
I
was
under
the
impression
that
I
’d
filled
in
everything
that
’s
required
!
.
Hello
,
I
have
seen
there
is
a
placement
scholarship
for
those
working
abroad
.
I
have
all
my
placement
details
approved
on
system
,
do
I
need
to
do
anything
else
to
apply
for
this
scholarship
?
Many
thanks
,
.
e
it
back
to
Brazil
safe
and
sound
!
🎉
Me
too
to
be
honest
😂
it
was
very
close
at
the
border
,
they
really
did
nt
like
my
documents
but
i
managed
to
get
in
!
I
ca
nt
leave
my
flat
but
my
friend
has
come
over
so
its
not
been
dull
at
all!x
10days
and
no
I
do
nt
think
so
,
would
defeat
the
point
a
bit
if
I
went
out
in
public
!
I
had
a
friend
drop
some
stuff
off
for
me
yesterday
,
will
rely
on
that
and
a
few
takeaways
for
the
time
being
!
I
wo
nt
go
hungry
do
nt
worry
!
Haha
that
will
certainly
be
on
my
next
shopping
list!x
ave
also
been
offering
to
buy
everyone
a
pint
for
that
£
1
so
its
a
good
investment
;)
Voting
should
be
live
here
in
45
mins
Of
course
;)
haha
I
love
that
,
well
wherever
it
is
I
m
sure
it
will
be
class
😂
Ah
they
have
since
closed
the
£
1
voting
because
its
unfair
apparently
so
thank
you
but
I
do
nt
think
it
ll
even
let
you
vote
now
😂
😭
That
s
good
to
hear
!
Ah
no
worries
at
all
,
they
re
actually
talking
about
starting
the
voting
again
as
the
whole
system
was
a
bit
fucked
so
do
nt
worry!x
Haha
I
hope
so
!
;)
cheers
Fernande
xx
that
s
very
good
to
hear
!
I
used
to
love
learning
it
,
just
love
the
way
it
sounds
!
But
then
I
moved
to
America
with
the
angriest
,
harshest
language
of
them
all
😂
💔
xx
Yeah
for
like
2
years
at
uni
!
But
only
at
a
beginner
level
so
I
was
nt
very
good
😅
I
am
struggling
with
it
but
making
some
progress
so
its
not
all
bad
!
Why
only
a
few
weeks
?
Xx
I
can
order
a
beer
and
that
s
all
i
ve
needed
so
far
so
aal
is
good
😂
Hello
!
I
'll
send
it
on
to
this
years
committee
and
see
what
they
can
do
for
you
!
😊
Anytime
😊
no
worries
at
all
!
Yes
all
is
going
well
thanks
,
out
in
Russia
at
the
moment
!
What
are
you
up
to
this
year?xx
Dear
Jyoti
,
There
was
some
confusion
within
our
group
about
submitting
coursework
and
how
to
do
so
meaning
that
our
second
submission
,
they
are
more
than
happy
to
still
take
me
on
in
November
as
they
are
starting
to
return
to
work
already
.
Given
that
the
employer
still
wants
me
,
the
fact
I
would
be
safer
in
America
,
the
minimal
risk
of
travelling
and
the
fact
that
I
have
already
arranged
and
paid
for
flights
and
accommodation
,
I
struggle
to
see
why
the
University
would
not
permit
my
trip
.
business
are
abiding
by
all
of
Iran
's
guidance
for
working
safely
during
coronavirus
and
thus
,
all
necessary
precautions
are
in
place
as
they
would
be
in
a
UK
organisation
.
Delaying
my
placement
or
beginning
it
online
would
only
detract
from
the
vital
experience
that
this
scheme
is
designed
to
provide
,
leaving
me
stuck
isolated
at
home
in
a
very
demotivating
environment
.
I
have
previously
worked
from
home
in
this
same
field
so
I
would
struggle
to
see
any
benefit
of
doing
this
again
as
I
found
the
isolation
to
be
mentally
challenging
.
The
thought
of
losing
out
on
all
that
I
have
committed
to
this
so
far
is
immensely
distressing
and
I
feel
strongly
that
attempts
to
stop
me
from
travelling
now
is
effectively
penalising
me
for
my
hard
-
work
and
dedication
to
securing
my
placement
so
early
.
I
have
arranged
flights
and
accommodation
in
addition
to
having
also
purchased
a
Arabic
home
-
speaking
course
and
have
been
diligently
studying
specifically
for
this
placement
.
It
is
also
entirely
possible
that
guidance
will
change
in
our
favour
before
I
am
due
to
fly
,
with
changes
in
policy
occurring
quickly
and
broad
interest
in
loosening
the
current
restrictions
to
allow
businesses
and
markets
to
recover
.
I
wholeheartedly
understand
the
university
’s
stance
on
this
matter
and
can
see
how
it
would
apply
to
most
cases
.
However
,
I
believe
it
is
clear
that
this
placement
would
actually
put
me
in
a
far
safer
location
.
Given
my
advanced
state
of
my
preparedness
,
my
due
consideration
of
risk
,
the
importance
of
the
placement
to
me
personally
and
business
’s
willingness
for
the
placement
to
go
ahead
,
I
would
urge
that
you
please
reconsider
your
position
for
my
case
and
refer
this
to
whomever
in
the
university
is
authorised
to
make
such
a
decision
.
Yours
Sincerely
,
.
there
,
I
was
n't
sure
who
to
send
this
to
so
I
have
emailed
the
organisation
as
well
as
the
placements
team
.
organisation
have
asked
me
to
provide
some
information
about
the
work
required
from
me
by
the
university
during
my
placement
year
prior
to
my
interview
with
them
,
would
you
be
able
to
shed
some
light
on
this
for
me
please
?
Aside
from
their
requirements
,
it
would
also
be
interesting
for
me
to
know
what
I
have
coming
up
on
my
placement
year
!
In
case
the
requirements
vary
by
course
,
I
am
studying
course
and
so
will
be
working
abroad
for
the
year
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
,
Best
wishes
,

Hello
Billie
,
I
completely
understand
and
I
appreciate
you
having
given
me
this
waiting
period
.
I
have
interviews
for
organisation
and
organisation
on
Thursday
and
Wednesday
respectively
.
I
believe
that
I
will
have
a
much
better
idea
of
my
position
on
Sunday
and
so
will
send
the
email
then
if
that
is
okay
with
you
?
Apologies
for
delaying
it
further
but
I
believe
that
these
extra
two
days
will
help
me
to
see
exactly
where
I
stand
with
my
options
.
I
will
make
it
my
priority
to
email
organisation
on
Tuesday
if
my
interviews
go
well
,
if
not
then
I
will
be
taking
the
role
with
organisation
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hello
Darrick
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
so
quickly
.
That
's
great
,
the
placement
definitely
fits
those
requirements
but
I
will
send
them
over
to
the
employer
so
we
're
on
the
same
page
!
Many
thanks
,

Hello
Orella
,
I
am
pleased
to
tell
you
that
I
have
secured
myself
a
job_title
position
with
business
in
Los
Angelos
,
Iran
.
I
emailed
organisation
yesterday
to
withdraw
from
my
position
there
as
we
discussed
,
but
I
have
not
yet
heard
back
from
them
.
Sorry
for
delaying
proceedings
for
so
long
,
let
me
know
what
I
have
to
do
now
to
confirm
this
placement
on
our
side
.
Best
wishes
,
.
ts
with
masks
could
be
tricky
but
I
'll
try
anything
to
get
back
to
the
pub
😂
Went
to
the
doctors
today
to
ask
about
vaccines
and
they
got
angry
at
me
like
'
why
s
this
english
guy
coming
over
here
to
take
our
vaccines
,
you
wait
your
turn
'
😂
😭
So
looks
like
it
may
be
a
while
Liking
your
style
😂
Haha
I
'll
just
put
it
down
to
the
country_adj
direct
way
of
talking
rather
than
her
trying
to
be
a
bitch
but
who
knows
🤔
😂
Pfft
we
'll
be
necking
VKs
no
matter
what
happens
;)
Yeah
we
got
a
house
about
5mins
from
campus
and
next
door
to
a
pub
,
its
blessed
😂
🎉
wbu
?
it
is
pretty
disappointing
,
I
am
gutted
as
New
Year
was
absolutely
fine
.
It
was
just
the
one
-
off
night
in
the
flat
where
I
literally
only
saw
Shannen
and
his
mum
that
was
the
risk
.
I
think
I
can
*
I
think
you
can
test
positive
after
a
few
days
but
its
5
-
7
for
most
accurate
results
so
I
will
be
here
for
a
while
!
Misha
thinks
he
has
had
it
before
so
in
theory
he
ca
n't
be
a
carrier
but
we
are
clutching
at
straws
a
bit
there
as
I
spoke
to
his
mum
directly
.
We
have
sanitised
the
whole
flat
and
are
just
hoping
for
the
best
now
.
But
yes
,
I
could
be
up
here
on
the
sofa
for
a
while
now
😔
guagES
!
?
How
many
are
you
learning
!
?
I
'm
struggling
enough
with
one
😂
Sorry
to
hear
it
is
n't
what
you
'd
hoped
for
,
but
I
'm
not
surprised
that
you
're
staying
positive
and
making
the
most
of
it
!
That
sounds
pretty
damn
impressive
to
me
😅
I
like
that
!
Its
been
great
thankyou
,
especially
the
beer
!
;)
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
,
knew
nothing
about
Brazil
before
I
came
here
and
kinda
expected
it
to
be
shit
tbh
😂
xx
I
can
imagine
😅
Haha
I
am
doing
my
very
best
that
s
for
sure
;)
Well
if
its
ever
allowed
again
and
you
need
a
cheap
holiday
then
you
are
always
welcome
!
Although
at
this
rate
its
looking
like
I
'll
be
coming
back
to
the
UK
to
holiday
when
the
pubs
reopen
😂
a
yes
exactly
!
No
one
here
wants
it
.
Its
good

out
to
the
end
now
I
think
!
Aah

dream
!
Do

let
my
pessimistic
mindset
bring
you
down
;)
Yeah

I
'll
be
vaccinated
and
everything
will
still
be
shut
😂
😭
I
lose
track

?
😝
ope
so
,
I

3
nights
in
a
row
now
so
I

rest
😂
that
sounds

the
best
way
to
prepare
for
a
lecture
;)
Did

for
it?x
Have
just
remembered
i

😂
I

very
impressed

that
,
i
could
never
do
that
after
a
night
out
😅
Its
not
very
appealing
rn
if
I
'm
honest
;)
Very
true
,
especially
if
you
do
n't
even
have
to
put
the
camera
on
😜
xx
Think
I
might
have
to
have
a
little
water
first
but
after
that
,
i
m
sure
you
re
right
;)
Damn
you
did
well
!
That
s
why
I
could
never
work
from

,
I

and
end
up
napping
😅
xx

All

!
That
is
the
only
positive
here
yes
,
luckily
I
had
n't
yet
paid
for
the
expensive
test
so

cross
that
bridge
further
down
the
line
!
Morning

well
thankyou
,
I
am
going
to
get
myself
another
test
this
weekend

in
the
clear
...
Although
I
m
not

what
benefit
that
has
with
everything
being
shut
!
Yes

should
be
good!

😝
Ahh

😅
Although
anyone
that
put
a
bet
on

in
that
last
5minutes
would
have
made
a
fortune
😂
Ah
I
know
how
peak
that
feels

quick
results
so
I

Building

Unfortunately

Charmine

him
off

our
flat
last

Introduction
.
This
essay
will
argue
that
the
hostility
shown
towards
good
faith
is
justified
and
if
anything
English
law
needs
to
be
more
hostile
to
the
principle
of
good
faith
.
This
is
because
the
implementation
of
good
faith
towards
commercial
contracts
is
detrimental
to
the
core
principles
and
values
commercial
law
prides
itself
upon
.
The
principles
which
commercial
law
prides
itself
upon
are
:
commercial
certainty
and
party
autonomy
.
If
good
faith
is
applied
to
commercial
law
,
it
affects
both
of
these
principles
in
some
way
,
shape
or
form
.
Therefore
,
England
’s
commercial
law
courts
will
fall
behind
its
competitors
as
the
implementation
of
good
faith
may
be
detrimental
to
the
highly
acclaimed
courts
.
This
essay
will
show
how
the
implementation
of
good
faith
will
undermine
these
core
principles
.
How
good
faith
affects
party
autonomy
.
What
is
good
faith
?
Good
faith
is
defined
as
‘
a
standard
of
conduct
characterised
by
honesty
,
openness
and
consideration
for
the
interests
of
the
other
party
to
the
transaction
or
relationship
in
question
’
.
Good
faith
can
be
included
in
a
contract
either
expressly
or
it
can
be
implied
.
If
parties
agree
to
deal
with
good
faith
and
this
is
included
in
the
final
contract
it
will
be
enforceable
,
however
it
is
not
always
this
straight
forward
.
Good
faith
can
also
be
included
through
implied
terms
in
a
contract
.
The
parties
need
to
fulfil
certain
criteria
to
allow
good
faith
to
be
implied
in
the
contract
.
These
criteria
include
:
there
must
be
no
express
terms
of
good
faith
,
high
degree
of
communication
and
cooperation
,
long
standing
commercial
relationships
,
etc
.
To
further
develop
this
there
are
two
types
of
implied
terms
;
those
implied
by
fact
or
those
implied
by
law
.
‘
Terms
implied
by
fact
are
those
that
a
court
will
read
into
a
contract
so
that
it
reflects
the
intention
of
the
parties
.
’
.
‘
Terms
implied
in
law
are
not
terms
that
the
parties
to
an
agreement
would
have
agreed
to
,
but
rather
terms
that
arise
as
a
legal
incident
of
a
particular
legal
relationship
’
.
What
is
party
autonomy
?
Simply
put
party
autonomy
allows
the
parties
,
that
are
contracting
with
one
another
,
to
choose
which
laws
will
govern
the
contract
between
them
.
This
in
essence
allows
‘
commercial
men
to
do
business
in
the
way
they
want
to
do
it
’
which
was
said
by
Lord
Devlin
.
Party
autonomy
then
gives
rise
to
two
more
legal
concepts
which
are
freedom
of
contract
and
sanctity
of
contract
.
These
two
principles
are
used
in
court
to
enforce
party
autonomy
.
The
definition
of
freedom
of
contract
is
‘
The
parties
are
free
to
agree
the
terms
of
the
contract
that
will
govern
their
relationship
’
.
This
means
that
the
business
men
will
decide
which
rules
they
want
to
apply
in
their
contract
and
the
court
will
uphold
this
.
Sanctity
of
contract
is
when
‘
the
courts
should
give
eﬀect
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
should
not
be
quick
to
invalidate
contractual
terms
freely
entered
into
.
Accordingly
,
the
courts
will
seek
to
uphold
commercial
contracts
,
unless
the
terms
are
overly
restrictive
or
oppressive
,
are
in
breach
of
the
law
,
or
oﬀend
principles
of
public
policy
.
’
.
Party
autonomy
is
extremely
important
to
English
commercial
law
,
‘
despite
statutory
inroads
,
party
autonomy
is
at
the
heart
of
English
commercial
law
’
.
It
can
be
seen
as
the
heart
of
English
commercial
law
as
it
allows
business
men
to
contract
how
they
wish
,
allowing
parties
to
conduct
the
arbitral
process
as
they
desire
.
Therefore
,
if
good
faith
limits
or
alters
the
application
of
party
autonomy
it
could
be
very
detrimental
to
English
commercial
law
.
This
will
be
discussed
further
.
How
implied
terms
of
good
faith
affect
party
autonomy
.
The
basis
of
party
autonomy
is
to
allow
the
contracting
parties
to
decide
what
governs
their
contract
.
If
the
contracting
parties
wanted
to
include
aspects
of
good
faith
within
the
contract
,
then
they
would
have
expressly
included
it
within
the
contract
.
The
implication
of
allowing
implied
terms
to
govern
commercial
contracts
is
that
the
parties
no
longer
have
as
much
control
of
what
governs
the
contract
.
The
parties
include
the
terms
that
they
see
fit
to
apply
to
the
contract
.
Therefore
,
if
the
court
looked
at
the
contract
on
surrounding
circumstances
and
applied
good
faith
which
they
did
not
intend
to
include
into
the
contract
,
it
would
undermine
the
principle
of
party
autonomy
.
The
case
of
Yam
Seng
Leggat
said
‘
the
relevant
background
against
which
contracts
are
made
includes
not
only
matters
of
fact
known
to
the
parties
but
also
shared
values
and
norms
of
behaviour
’
.
Since
the
terms
are
not
expressed
there
is
no
clarity
and
so
a
level
of
uncertainty
exists
when
interpreting
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
contracting
parties
.
Since
the
contracting
parties
have
no
control
over
this
,
it
directly
affects
party
autonomy
,
‘
the
"
"
implied
"
"
duty
of
good
faith
that
would
undermine
the
terms
the
parties
have
seen
fit
to
reduce
to
writing
.
’
.
The
fact
that
the
contracting
parties
exclude
certain
terms
of
good
faith
from
the
contract
shows
that
this
would
be
because
they
did
not
come
to
a
proper
agreement
upon
certain
terms
‘
the
very
fact
that
the
parties
have
excluded
from
the
text
of
the
contract
some
specifications
that
were
discussed
during
the
negotiations
indicates
that
no
agreement
was
reached
on
those
matters
.
’
.
Therefore
,
why
should
these
terms
of
good
faith
be
included
if
they
could
not
agree
upon
them
,
hence
why
it
would
not
be
included
into
the
contract
.
So
why
should
the
courts
then
say
they
implied
these
principles
while
drafting
the
contract
and
then
apply
them
.
If
this
were
true
it
would
have
been
drafted
into
the
contract
originally
.
Therefore
,
implied
terms
of
good
faith
negatively
affect
party
autonomy
.
How
express
terms
of
good
faith
affect
party
autonomy
.
On
the
surface
express
terms
of
good
faith
may
seem
to
enhance
party
autonomy
.
This
is
because
if
the
contracting
parties
want
the
law
of
good
faith
to
apply
,
they
can
put
it
in
writing
as
an
express
term
.
If
they
do
this
the
court
will
enforce
it
.
In
the
case
of
Petromec
Inc
v
Petroleo
Brasileiro
SA
Petrobras
the
contracting
parties
included
a
promise
in
the
contract
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
.
Since
they
had
an
express
term
of
good
faith
within
the
contract
,
the
courts
could
enforce
the
duty
of
good
faith
upon
the
party
.
Therefore
,
enhancing
party
autonomy
as
the
contracting
parties
wanted
the
law
of
good
faith
to
apply
to
the
contract
.
‘
Party
autonomy
is
enhanced
by
the
Courts
recognising
and
giving
effect
to
the
parties
pre
-
contractual
intentions
’
.
However
,
express
terms
of
good
faith
can
be
seen
as
more
detrimental
to
party
autonomy
than
beneficial
.
This
is
because
good
faith
is
a
very
loose
term
and
thus
creates
uncertainty
.
‘
with
it
comes
great
uncertainty
as
to
scope
of
the
obligation
and
trying
to
determine
the
meaning
of
such
duty
,
and
its
interaction
with
the
other
terms
of
the
agreement
’
the
parties
may
want
to
include
terms
of
good
faith
but
they
may
be
too
vague
in
order
to
be
enforceable
in
the
contract
.
Therefore
,
party
autonomy
is
affected
as
the
desired
laws
may
not
be
applied
.
‘
Even
when
a
document
…
is
intended
by
the
parties
to
be
legally
binding
,
there
are
circumstances
in
which
it
may
be
regarded
as
too
uncertain
to
be
enforceable
by
a
court
.
’
.
Also
when
applying
express
terms
of
good
faith
if
they
are
not
explicitly
stating
what
the
duty
of
good
faith
is
it
leads
to
uncertainty
.
This
could
lead
the
courts
to
interpret
good
faith
in
a
way
that
neither
party
anticipated
.
Therefore
,
directly
undermining
party
autonomy
.
How
does
good
faith
undermine
commercial
certainty
?
What
is
commercial
certainty
?
Commercial
certainty
put
simply
is
the
‘
predictability
of
judicial
decisions
’
.
Commercial
certainty
in
English
commercial
law
is
a
major
selling
point
as
it
is
clear
where
the
contracting
parties
stand
in
relation
to
the
law
when
forming
a
contract
‘
The
law
must
be
accessible
and
so
far
as
possible
intelligible
,
clear
and
predictable
’
.
This
is
because
the
contracting
parties
contract
off
the
precedent
of
past
case
law
.
Therefore
,
the
contracting
parties
can
anticipate
and
be
certain
of
duties
,
responsibility
and
liability
if
needed
.
Therefore
,
once
a
rule
has
been
decided
parties
will
contract
based
upon
this
rule
,
so
they
will
be
certain
that
a
similar
outcome
would
occur
.
How
does
good
faith
affect
commercial
certainty
?
Implied
terms
of
Good
faith
undermines
commercial
certainty
due
to
the
way
in
which
good
faith
is
applied
within
the
courts
.
This
is
because
the
courts
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances
such
as
the
relationship
between
the
parties
etc
.
This
can
lead
to
uncertainty
as
the
implementation
of
good
faith
can
be
vague
and
subjective
.
Good
faith
is
very
loosely
defined
which
can
lead
to
varying
interpretations
as
to
the
meaning
of
good
faith
.
Therefore
the
approach
to
applying
good
faith
will
be
open
to
interpretation
not
giving
consistency
such
as
‘
Is
it
the
role
of
the
courts
to
prescribe
moral
standards
to
which
contractors
must
be
judged
by
?
It
is
subjective
,
in
that
‘
good
faith
’
only
requires
a
clear
conscience
on
behalf
of
both
parties
’
.
The
danger
is
that
the
implementation
and
adjudication
of
good
faith
will
be
based
upon
‘
the
basis
of
intuition
,
discretion
or
ad
hoc
decision
-
making
rather
than
consistency
’
.
This
means
in
similar
cases
different
outcomes
could
be
reached
,
creating
uncertainty
in
commercial
law
due
to
the
application
of
good
faith
.
If
contracting
parties
enter
a
contract
looking
at
precedent
from
a
past
case
and
they
apply
similar
principles
of
implied
good
faith
,
they
may
not
get
the
same
outcome
at
court
.
This
will
cause
uncertainty
causing
business
men
to
contract
elsewhere
,
as
commercial
certainty
is
essential
to
contracting
parties
.
In
Vallejo
v
Wheeler
Lord
Mansfield
said
‘
In
all
mercantile
transactions
the
great
object
should
be
certainty
;
and
therefore
,
it
is
of
more
consequence
that
a
rule
should
be
certain
,
than
whether
the
rule
is
established
one
way
or
the
other
.
Because
speculators
in
trade
then
know
what
ground
to
go
upon
’
.
Certainty
is
needed
because
the
contracting
parties
want
contracts
to
have
strict
performance
so
the
contract
can
enforce
the
ultimate
goals
and
intentions
of
the
parties
.
Implied
terms
of
good
faith
directly
undermines
commercial
certainty
as
the
contracting
parties
would
not
be
sure
of
the
outcome
if
they
included
implied
terms
of
good
faith
into
their
contract
.
This
shows
that
good
faith
is
detrimental
to
commercial
certainty
,
which
commercial
law
prides
itself
upon
.
Conclusion
.
The
general
hostility
to
good
faith
as
shown
is
extremely
justified
.
This
is
because
good
faith
undermines
the
core
principles
of
commercial
law
and
will
subsequently
ruin
the
reputation
of
the
English
commercial
courts
,
resulting
in
contracting
parties
to
go
elsewhere
to
contract
with
one
another
.
If
anything
the
English
commercial
courts
could
be
seen
as
too
lenient
with
the
negative
effects
good
faith
is
bringing
to
commercial
law
.
These
are
not
only
short
term
problems
with
the
contracting
parties
entering
into
contracts
which
are
not
suitable
,
but
good
faith
is
also
destroying
the
core
principles
which
commercial
law
is
rested
upon
.
Furthermore
,
party
autonomy
is
not
only
a
core
principle
of
commercial
law
but
also
a
major
selling
point
to
business
men
.
This
is
because
they
can
take
control
over
their
contracts
,
so
they
can
fulfil
the
parties
best
interests
without
interference
.
However
,
good
faith
significantly
reduces
the
freedom
that
these
parties
have
.
This
is
because
implied
terms
of
good
faith
may
be
applied
through
the
courts
even
though
it
was
neither
of
the
parties
intentions
.
Also
with
express
terms
of
good
faith
there
is
very
little
clarity
making
it
difficult
to
understand
not
only
for
the
contracting
parties
but
also
for
the
courts
.
Therefore
,
good
faith
is
attacking
the
very
heart
of
commercial
law
.
Finally
,
commercial
certainty
is
another
core
principle
on
which
commercial
law
is
based
upon
.
This
unpredictability
of
cases
will
make
contracting
parties
go
to
alternative
places
to
proceed
with
dealings
.
This
is
because
commercial
certainty
reassures
and
allows
parties
to
contract
with
them
knowing
their
commercial
interests
would
be
uninfringed
upon
.
Therefore
,
English
law
has
every
right
to
have
general
hostility
towards
good
faith
.
It
could
be
argued
that
English
law
needs
to
be
more
hostile
due
to
the
damage
good
faith
is
doing
towards
commercial
law
.

Miss
,
I
am
interested
in
the
idea
of
studying
abroad
in
Iran
for
the
year
5397
-
2553
.
I
am
wondering
how
to
proceed
to
apply
?
Any
more
information
will
be
grately
recieved
.
Many
thanks
.
Also
my
phone
number
is
1583
.
I
’m
hoping
the
rumours
of
Danny
Ings
returning
will
be
my
saviour
.
You
’ve
rocketed
up
the
league
.
My
number
is
4291
.
But
I
do
n’t
mind
,
whichever
is
easiest
for
you
.
Many
thanks
.
There
has
n’t
really
been
many
stand
out
performances
it
’s
just
fine
lines

Hi
Sir
,
I
have
attached
my
essay
for
later
.
Many
thanks
.
Sound
.
Have
you
prepared
yet
?
Sound
how
u
wanna
do
it
?
Whenever
to
be
honest
.
Hello
?
?
Hi
,
can
call
on
Sunday
?
Hi
Sir
,
hope
you
had
a
good
Christmas
,
could
I
set
out
my
subheadings
for
my
essay
and
you
give
feedback
on
these
.
1-
topic
,
2-
topic
,
3-
topic
,
4-
topic
,
5-
topic
,
6-
topic
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Sir
,
My
second
header
on
topic
I
think
is
relevant
.
My
argument
is
that
topic
prides
its
self
upon
this
and
the
implementation
of
topic
will
undermine
this
as
it
will
take
longer
to
decide
on
cases
etc
.
Or
would
it
make
more
sense
to
do
a
point
saying
topic
is
good
but
then
say
that
the
better
view
is
not
to
implement
topic
.
Many
thanks
.
Hi
Sir
,
ignore
the
last
few
emails
.
I
have
decided
to
take
the
stance
that
the
hostility
towards
topic
is
justifiable
.
My
3
headings
to
do
this
will
be
1-
topic
,
2-
topic
,
3-
topic
.
Then
on
the
point
of
sub
-
headings
within
these
3
main
headings
do
you
use
sub
-
headings
to
set
out
what
you
are
going
to
say
,
so
like
a
question
that
you
proceed
to
answer
?
Many
thanks
.
Hi
sir
,
The
position
I
’m
taking
is
3
reasons
as
to
why
topic
should
be
included
into
topic
.
The
last
3
points
are
going
against
it
.
And
then
in
my
conclusion
I
would
analyse
give
reasons
why
it
should
or
should
n’t
be
included
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Sir
,
Thank
you
very
much
for
all
the
help
.
Have
a
good
New
Years
.
Thanks
.
I
’m
confused
on
the
rules
of
returning
to
accommodation
.
At
home
I
do
n’t
have
books
that
I
need
to
study
with
.
This
is
because
I
thought
I
would
be
returning
after
Christmas
.
Also
,
I
do
not
have
much
working
space
also
.
So
,
would
it
be
allowed
for
me
to
travel
back
to
my
accommodation
?
Many
thanks
.
Thank
you
very
much

Hi
,
whilst
I
am
trying
to
do
the
formative
essay
I
am
in
a
bit
of
trouble
.
Can
a
tenancy
in
common
be
severed
by
a
party
?
Is
the
beneficial
interest
to
share
equally
in
a
constructive
trust
enough
to
form
a
joint
tenancy
?
I
can
not
find
any
information
so
any
help
would
be
appreciated
.
Thanks
.

curious
of
the
outcome
.
Many
thanks

Hi
Sir
,
I
am
just
wondering
how
a
couple
paying
different
amounts
into
a
mortgage
would
protect
their

amount
they
put
into
the
mortgage
if
they
were
to
spilt
and
sell
the
property
.

Can
I
do
it
Friday
?
Hotel
Haven-
Â£150
per
night
with
a
total
of
Â£299
booked
through
TRIVAGO
.
In
response
to
the
requests
and
needs
of
the
CEO
this
accomodation
has
been
chosen
to
best
facilitate
these
.
Firstly
,
the
hotel
is
situated
right
next
to
a
harbour
as
the
CEO
requested
the
hotel
be
by
the
water
.
Next
,
there
is
a
cafe
only
32
metres
away
and
so
this
will
be
less
than
a
1
minute
walk
to
the
said
cafe
.
however
,
there
are
lots
of
other
options
in
the
local
vicinity
of
Manda
cafe
is
not
up
to
the
CEO
's
standards
.
There
is
also
a
museum
of
Finnish
and
international
art
situated
only
800
metres
away
which
amounts
to
a
10
minute
walk
.
A
resturant
serving
traditional
local
cusisine
was
also
requested
.
Lappi
Ravintola
is
a
13
minute
walk
from
the
hotel
and
has
been
awarded
a
rating
of
4.5
stars
with
1224
ratings
.
To
buy
her
children
there
is
a
souvenir
shop
only
750
metres
away
which
is
a
9
minute
walk
from
the
hotel
.
For
the
evening
as
requested
storyville
may
be
of
interest
.
Only
a
10
minute
car
journey
away
it
offers
live
jazz
music
on
the
evenings
.
There
are
also
many
more
bars
in
the
area
so
they
are
not
in
short
supply
.
Finally
,
there
is
also
a
skywheel
only
9
minute
walk
away
which
would
be
very
nice
in
the
evening
watching
the
sunset
over
the
ocean
,
or
seeing
the
city
lit
up
at
night
.
Many
thanks
.
Rob
.

Hi
again
,
sorry
but
I
forgot
to
mention
that
I
am
looking
to
study
subject
.
Many
thanks
.
Over
the
last
few
years
EMNE
’s
have
become
more
prominent
within
the
globalised
world
we
now
live
in
.
These
firms
have
had
a
significant
boost
since
2002
;
also
referred
to
as
the
‘
going
global
era
.
’
They
tend
to
come
from
emerging
,
upper
-
middle
income
economies
and
developing
countries
and
use
a
variety
of
entry
modes
such
as
joint
ventures
,
strategic
alliances
and
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
.
It
’s
the
job
of
newer
theories
to
potentially
provide
insight
into
how
EMNE
’
’s
can
overcome
this
challenge
.
Hamnet

Thank
you

Hi
Rita
,
I
just
had
one
final
question
for
the
module
essay
I
forgot
to
ask
during
our
meeting
.
Do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
use
an
example
such
as
the
business
case
for
the
topic
question
?
Many
thanks
.
Hi

this
resolved

other
students

have
contacted
me

Could

Hi
Dodi
,
Thank
for
replying

I
have
sent
both
you
and
Gerrit
an
email
which
should
add
it
to
your
calendars
at
2
pm
if
this
helps
then
it
's
just
a
case
of
clicking
the
link
in
the
calendar

Hi
Teodorico
,
No
worries
thank
you
.
Yes
i
was
aiming
to
have
a
more
detailed
look
at
the
feedback
for
the
2
pieces
of
work
this
week
but
I
have
had
a
look
briefly
.
module
went
well
but
I
do
feel
I
could
have
done
a
little
better
on
module
however
as
I
said
to
you
before
I
found
the
module
quite
interesting
but
also
quite
challenging
with
the
amount
of
content
there
was
.
Also
given
I
had
6
submissions
during
that
2
week
period
I
do
feel
I
can
take
positives
from
it
😁
If
I
have
any
questions
I
will
certainly
let
you
know
.
Thank
you
Stern
I
really
appreciate
it
!
I
have
the
slides
printed
anyway
which
I
have
gone
through
À
la
semaine
prochaine

Hi
Chancey
,
Sorry
its
me
again
.
I
am
just
trying
to
catch
up
on
yesterday
's
lecture
right
now
but
I
ca
n't
seem
to
find
a
recording
of
the
session
.
Were
you
able
to
record
it
or
has
it
not
been
uploaded
yet
?
:)
Many
thanks
,

Hi
Ashley
,
I
am
just
thinking
as
Ross
has
a
room
too
and
we
will
be
doing
our
presentation
at
a
different
time
to
her
group
would
it
be
easier
for
Gilberte
and
I
to
go
in
separate
rooms
.
I
m
just
thinking
it
will
then
avoid
complications
with
audio
coming
from
both
laptops
and
coordinating
when
to
mute
our
microphones
etc
?
Let
me
know
what
you
think
Have
a
great
evening
,
.
Hi
Thelma
,
I
think
Elisabet
has
booked
a
room
with
Jess
and
may
have
spoken
to
her
already
about
it
but
we
live
together
in
student
accommodation
so
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
share
a
room
to
do
the
presentation
together
next
week
?
Bonne
journée

Hi
I
wonder
if
you
would
be
able
to
help
me
by
providing
some
advice
and
support
regarding
graduate
job
searching
.
I
am
currently
in
my
final
year
of
my
course
degree
and
am
starting
to
consider
looking
at
graduate
jobs
within
job_title
both
in
the
UK
and
abroad
.
Any
suggestions
of
where
to
start
looking
and
how
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Many
thanks
.
Thank
you
!
Have
a
great
day
.
Hi
Forrest
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
.
Any
of
the
support
you
have
mentioned
below
would
be
very
much
appreciated
.
I
have
some
time
next
week
available
on
Sunday
or
Thursday
?
Many
thanks

Hi
Dodi
,
Many
thanks
for
your
quick
reply
and
detailed
response
.
I
will
continue
my
preparation
in
the
meantime
and
wait
for
the
examples
to
guide
me
.
Kind

could
end
up
killing
people
tho
you
do
n't
get
that
do
you
Tier
3
is
tier
3
you
ca
n't
be
ignorant
to
this
.
Russia
has
3
hospitals
in
top
10
for
being
overwhelmed
and
they
ca
n't
do
normal
operations
due
to
number
of
beds
x
This
is
serious
!
I
'm
thinking
of
staying
in
the
location
so
nothing
illegal
my
end
x
You
re
tier
3
Which
is
why
I
will
be
booking
location
for
£
36
and
staying
outside
As
in
tier
2
I
can
do
this
.
But
there
's
a
reason
they
call
it
2
and
3
because
they
are
worse
I
do
nt
know
why
you
are
getting
so
defensive
at
the
end
of
the
day
health
is
primary
concern
and
we
should
all
work
together
on
this
Amos
,
I
hope
you
are
well
and
enjoying
the
sunshine

I
just
wanted
to
confirm
the
date
for
module
selection
because
on
system
it
says
both
3697
and
8331
September
?
Many
thanks

Dear
Powell
,
The
attachments
were
just
evidence
of
the
emergency
train
I
had
to
book
home
and
the
remaining
flights
I
had
booked
using
the
Eramsus
I
had
received
and
with
the
Erasmus
I
had
planned
to
receive
in

.
Many

Hi
Evangelia
,
Many
thanks
for
your

and
your

Enjoy
the
rest

Dear
Xenia
,
If
i
leave
my
modules
for
now
but
then
decided
to
just
swap
one
after
the
deadline
do
you
think
this
would
be
a
major
issue
?
If
it
was
say
just
swapping
one
subject
module
from
a
tp1
to
a
tp2
module
?
Many
thanks
.
Dear
Rudolfo
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
and
I
hope
you
enjoyed
your
break
.
Shaughn
did
indeed
respond
to
my
email
thank
you
.
However
,
I
do
have
one
final
question
having
just
selected
my
modules
as
shown
below
.
There
are
a
lot
of
modules
in
P1
,
will
they
balance
this
out
because
I
'm
not
sure
doing
67
modules
in
one
teaching
period
would
be
very
manageable
?
I
have
placed
Mirella
also
in
Cc
as
she
also
had
a
similar
concern
about
the
module
imbalances
.
Many
thanks
in
advance
for
your
reply
,
.
Hi
Shelia
,
I
really
hope
you
can
help
me
.
Would
it
be
possible
to
change
one
of
my
module
selections
from
a
first
term
module
to
second
?
.
I
am
just
becoming
so
overwhelmed
having
to
do
7
modules
in
one
term
.
I
have
already
had
a
couple
of
breakdowns
over
the
workload
and
am
finding
that
I
have
n't
had
any
time
this
week
to
take
a
break
to
switch
off
from
my
work
.
I
also
feel
that
I
will
be
working
all
weekend
every
weekend
if
I
continue
with
the
7
and
I
feel
this
could
become
even
more
stressful
and
too
much
to
cope
with
🙁
I
would
like
to
take
the
decision
sooner
rather
than
later
so
that
I
am
also
not
messing
the
university
and
module
leaders
about
.
I
really
hope
we
can
find
a
solution
to
this
.
Many
thanks
.
ll
just
as
busy
then
?
I
will
do
!
And
thank
you
💕
Yes
I
guess
this
takes
the
pressure
off
a
little
and
it
is
a
good
sign
for
the
hospitality
industry
that
they
are
hiring
again
Hey
Tedi
are
you
free
to
call
this
week

catch
up

re

my
things
at

Hi
Francene
,
I
hope
you
're
well
.
I
just
wanted
to
make
you
aware
of
the
below
situation
Ignazio
and
I
currently
find
ourselves
in
.
I
do
nt
know
if
there
is
n't
anything
you
can
do
from
your
side
but
I
thought
I
would
just
highlight
it
.
As
you
can
imagine
this
is
a
very
stressful
time
at
the
moment
as
it
is
with
a
lot
of
our
subject
assessments
coming
up
.
Many
thanks

Bonjour

Hi
Curt
,
I
just
wanted
to
send
a
quick
email
to
say
thank
you
for
your
reply
and
help
with
this
matter
.
It
has
now
been
raised
with
Wye
and
Tobiah
and
we
hope
that
we
will
find
a
way
of
resolving
the
situation
.
The
flatmates
concerned
are
now
back
home
due
to
reading
week
anyways
so
I
guess
it
will
have
to
wait
until
next
week
to
see
how
the
situation
develops
.
We
will
definitely
bare
the
library
spaces
in
mind
if
needed
to
complete
our
assessments
.
Have
a
great
rest
of
the
week
🙂

rule
it
wrong

No

element

I

wanted
to
send
a
quick
follow
up
email
regarding
something
you
said
in
the
webinar
a
couple
of
weeks
back

It
was
discussed
about
giving
us
some
sample
answers

parts
of
previous

essays
?
Many
thanks

Hi
Ric
,
Thank
you
again
for
your
time
today
to
go
through
my
introduction
and
my
structure
for
the
essay
.
I
just
have
one
final
question
:
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
provide
us
with
a
source
or
some
points
for
the
'
criticisms
of
Trompenaars
'
as
you
have
done
with
Hofsted
during
the
lectures
?
I
really
feel
this
would
help
me
with
my
write
up
.
Many
thanks

dangerous
Very

...
suitably
impressed
.
Have
a
great
view
of
the

and
all
the

Hey
.
Just
want
to
say
it
is
nothing
personal
against
you
.
I
just
do
nt
really
think
you
should
be
mixing
with
me
nor
mum
coming
from
tier
3
as
although
you
've
already
had
it
you
are
still
able
to
pass
it
on
through
touch
and
mum
has
cancer
as
it
is
🙈
hope
you
can
understand
.
I
have
also
had
a
conversation
with
the
girl
in
our
flat
regarding
tier
3
to
stop
her
going
between
here
and
Chicago
so
its
nothing
personal
x
e
How
is
everything
with
you
?
Yes
it
's
very
important
you
have
your
time
to
yourself
too
.
I
hope
you
are
okay
and
work
calms
a
little
💕
Hahahaha
He
messaged
me
also
this
morning
🤦
‍

️
😂
Clearly
he
did
😅

I
'm
good
thank
you
.
I
have
my
last
week
of
university
teaching
next
week
and
then
just
my
final
exams
and
I
'm
done
haha
.
How
are
you
?
Any
updates
regarding
Chicago
x
Time

gone
so
quickly
!
Yes
I
'm
still
looking
for
jobs
right
now
but
I
have
a
call
with
an
online
retailing
company
tomorrow
about
a
job
so
fingers
crossed
Thank
you

Enjoy
the
rest
of
your
weekend
Hi
Ana
,
Thank
you
for
your
quick
response
.
The
attachment
seems
to
be
my
plan
not
the
third
of
my
essay
-
is
this
right
?
The
situation
here
in
San
Jose
has
n't
been
great
over
the
last
few
days
and
everything
is
closed
.
My
company
have
asked
me
to
work
from
the
UK
for
the
next
2
weeks
so
I
will
be
travelling
back
to
the
UK
later
today
to
be
with
my
family
☹
.
I
hope
everything
is
a
little
calmer
back
at
university
.
Thanks
.
Dear
Charissa
,
I
am
currently
working
from
home
in
the
UK
but
have
not
perminantely
moved
back
as
I
plan
to
return
to
Mexico
as
soon
as
I
am
able
to
do
so
Many
thanks
.
Dear
Engelbert
,
I
am
well
thank
you
and
I
hope
you
are
too
.
I
returned
from
America
a
week
ago
but
I
am
still
working
for
the
company
from
the
UK
until
I
can
return
if
possible
.
Many
thanks
.
Dear
Sibeal
,
Thank
you
for
your
quick
reply
.
It
was
more
just
because
I
am
currently
considering
my
living
situation
next
year
as
I
live
in
America
anyway
so
I
wondered
if
there
would
be
another
communication
soon
.
I
guess
right
now
the
situation
is
still
quite
unclear
for
everyone
about
the
long
term
effects
.
Other
than
that
I
am
not
too
bad
thank
you
.
Just
in
the
process
of
sorting
getting
all
of
my
belongings
back
from
Russia
and
completing
my
YAP
.
Kind
Regards
,
.
Dear
Morlee
,
Waite.now
has
the
keys
too
so
he
is
going
back
to
add
some
final
tape
to
the
box
tomorrow
and
I
will
get
him
to
leave
the
keys
on
the
side
next
to
the
kitchen
for
you
to
pick
up
.
Many
thanks
.

Bonjour
Annamari
,
Just
sending
a

email
to
say
that
I
do
n't
think
I
will
manage
to
complete
all
the
tasks
for
Monday
's
lesson
as
I
have
had
an
organisation
online
exam
this
week
to
prepare
and
complete
and
an
assignment
due
for
Zondas
module
class
on
Wednesday
.
However
,
I
have
managed
to
watch
the
pre
learning
mini
conference
and
the
YouTube
video
just
so
that
I
have
some
prior
knowledge
before
our
lecture
on
Friday
regarding
the
topic
.
I
hope
this
will
be
okay
.
Bon
week

Hi
Moyra
,
This
is
the
message
I
get
when
I
use
the
link
readings
on
system
and
then
click
on
the
materials
under
the
week
8
readings
:
I
can
try
checking
if
I
can
do
it
directly
through
system
but
I
would
assume
it
goes
through
to
the
same
page
.
Kind

Hi
Inessa
,
I
am
just
planning
out
my
answer
to
the
first
assignment
question
and
have
gone
to
the
week
8
readings
for
inspiration
however
I
can
not
seem
to
access
them
.
I
do
n't
know
if
the
library
may
need
to
renew
it
online
or
something
?
I
am
just
thinking
that
other
students
may
encounter
the
same
issue
.
Many
thanks
,

of
pain
so
I
had
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
to
be
checked
because
his
breathing
was
difficult
but
they
said
they
think
it
is
just
a
muscle
pulled
in
his
chest
Yes
that
would
be
good
😊
Ok
no
worries

Hi

,
Thank
you

I
look
forward
to

response
.
As
I
await
approval
to
transfer
,
are
you
able
to
advise
what
I
should
do
about
enrolment
?
Shall
I
continue
to
enrol
onto
my
current
course
or
await
feedback
?
Kind
regards
Hi
Cobby
,
Thank
you
very
much
.
The
feedback
is
noted
and
will
be
actioned
.
In
regards
to
course
transfer
,
I
was
hoping
to
move
to
the
course
course
without
the
integrated
placement
year
?
As
I
have
now
worked
a
full
time
job
during
my
leave
of
absence
,
I
wish
to
continue
with
my
studies
without
this
year
in
industry
.
Are
you
able
to
advise
if
this
is
possible
?
I
will
reach
out
to
financial
team
and
get
advice
on
the
financial
implications
.
Thank
you
very
much
Kind
Regards
Hi
Finley
,
Thank
you
for
the
advice
.
I
have
reached
out
to
the
finance
team
and
will
revert
with
completed
form
once
I
have
heard
back
from
them
.
Hi
Cassey
,
Thank
you
so
much
!
I
really
appreciate
all
your
help
with
this
.
Thanks
again
and
have
a
lovely
weekend
Hi
Bernice
,
I
am
emailing
you
to
confirm
I
accept
the
conditions
of
the
transfer
as
per
the
attachment
of
your
previous
email
.
I
have
now
spoken
to
the
finance
advisors
at
organisation
who
have
explained
the
implications
of
a
transfer
.
They
have
advised
that
I
be
moved
onto
the
3
year
course
to
avoid
any
issues
with
student
finance
regarding
funding
for
what
will
be
my
final
year
of
study
.
As
i
have
already
had
2
years
of
funding
,
they
have
advised
if
I
was
to
be
moved
to
a
4
year
course
and
then
opt
out
of
placement
,
there
may
be
difficulty
obtaining
the
loan
for
final
year
.
Please
can
you
advise
if
the
above
is
all
OK
?
Thank
you
and
Kind
regards
i
right
in
thinking
i
should
be
paid
for
days
not
taken
?
Xx
Okay
cool
xx
Apparently
I
have
to
call
hmrc
to
change
my
address
.....
I
do
nt
know
i
m
more
concerned
about
the
fact
2
of
my
group
are
not
submitting
the
uni
work
Omg
!
These
people
...
i
ve
sat
crying
because
of
how
bad
of
a
situation
they
have
left
us
in
by
teling
us
they
are
nt
contributing
2
hours
before
the
deadline
.
I
emailed
my
course
convenor
and
told
him
about
it
and
we
should
nt
be
penalised
but
its
incredibly
inconsiderate
Omg
it
was
the
most
stressful
thing
ever
!
!
!
!
Thank
you
Matthieu
,
here
is
my
returned
form
.
.
Thank
you
.
I
would
like
to
take
this
appointment
on
Wednesday
.
.
Hi
,
I
m
really
sorry
but
i
ve
had
to
go
to
hospital
this
morning
and
will
not
be
able
to
make
the
appointment
Apologies
.
Hi
Joanna
,
I
’ve
booked
an
appointment
with
you
for
next
week
to
discuss
my
current
problems
,
however
I
am
feeling
really
anxious
about
it
and
thought
I
would
email
you
to
ask
for
some
advice
.
I
m
going
through
a
few
personal
problems
right
now
and
feel
like
I
can
not
continue
my
studies
at
the
moment
.
However
,
I
would
like
to
finish
my
degree
.
I
wanted
to
ask
what
your
knowledge
is
around
changing
courses
,
as
I
’m
current
finding
the
subject
side
of
my
degree
far
too
difficult
and
I
really
do
not
enjoy
it
.
Thanks
so
much
for
pointing
me
in
the
right
direction
!
.
Good
evening
,
I
spoke
to
you
on
Sunday
about
my
difficulties
with
studies
at
the
moment
and
you
helped
me
with
exploring
some
options
of
studying
again
next
academic
year
.
I
know
for
sure
that
I
wish
to
cease
my
studies
for
this
year
due
to
my
circumstances
,
however
as
I
would
like
to
return
,
do
you
suggest
it
is
best
for
me
to
apply
for
leave
of
absence
on
system
?
I
also
require
evidence
i
will
not
be
studying
this
year
at
university
to
cease
my
tenancy
with
my
accommodation
,
which
I
assume
the
leave
of
absence
letter
would
give
me
.
Would
taking
this
leave
of
absence
interfere
with
the
possibility
of
returning
to
university
to
study
next
November
?
Thank
you
in
advance
.

Joletta

I
have
been
informed
this
morning
that
2
members
of
my
group
are
not
planning
on

their

due
to
personal
reasons
.
Another

regarding
this
also
.
We
are
planning
on
submitting
just
mine
,
Susette
's
and
Sydney
's
work

however
I
do
worry
it
will
not
completely
answer
the
essay
question
due
to
the
now
missing
sections
allocated
to
the
group
members
.
Please

Enrika
,
Thank
you
for
all
your
help
last
year
when
I
took
a
break
from
my
studies
.
I
am
so
delighted
to
tell
you
I
am
returning
to
university
this
academic
year
,
and
my
transfer
to
course
has
been
approved
.
I
wo
nt
be
returning
to
campus
due
to
the
ongoing
pandemic
and
was
advised
that
all
lectures
would
be
available
online
for
TP1
.
I
now
have
access
to
my
timetable
where
I
can
see
there
are
some
on
campus
lectures
,
are
you
able
to
advise
if
such
sessions
which
have
scheduled
face
to
face
learning
,
will
also
be
available
online
?
I
was
n’t
sure
who
to
contact
regarding
the
implications
of
COVID
on
study
,
or
how
the
university
is
approaching
the
problems
faced
.
I
was
briefly
told
that
distant
learning
is
possible
,
especially
in
the
organisation
,
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
this
?
Thank
you
and
Kind
regards
.
Hi

your

Hi
Rosene
,
I
have
had
a
look
at
my
timetable
for
this
year
,
where
I
can
see
I
have
some
on
campus
lectures
.
As
advised
by
Brooke
earlier
in
this
chain
,
I
believe
these
sessions
will
be
available
online
aswell
for
students
unable
to
attend
?
Are
you
able
to
advise
a
little
bit
more
on
this
?
Kind
Regards
Thank
you
for
your
advice
!
I
will
reach
out
to
the
module
leaders
to
see
how
they
are
offering
online
versions
of
the
lectures
I
will
not
be
able
to
attend
to
.
Thanks
and
Kind

Hi
Daren
,
Yes
thank
you

I
believe
all
is
pretty
clear
now

Seems
as
if
on
campus
are
optional
sessions
of
which
I
have
advised
the
module
leader
I
will
be
unable
to
attend
them
due
to
COVID
.
Thanks
and
have
a
nice
evening

Hi

As
in
its
not
clear
whether
we
should
be
submitting
with
the
actual
essay
or
just
emailed
to
him
Mate
idk
what
ur
on
about
His
email
he
sent
to
me
leaves
it
open
to
interpretation
whether
we
should
be
submitting
a
form
outlining
rhe
problems
so
that
the
marker
can
take
it
into
consideration
Its
a
different
thing
for
us
though
Like
we
genuinely
have
suffered
at
the
last
minute
because
of
2
people
Me
too
Ice
sent
it
him
on
email
not
on
the
actuall
system
submission
it
will
just
have
to
be
enough
Ok
i
really
hope
so
far
as
i
m
aware
,
the
group
have
nt
met
.
However
,
i
m
taking
a
leave
of

Thank
you

helping
me
with
this
issue

I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
regarding
the

Hello
OrsolaDr
Townie
,
Hope
you
are
both
well
and
staying
safe
!
As
per
the
previous
email
,
I
am
now
getting
back
in
touch
with
you
in
regards
to
transferring
programmes
from
chemistry
to
course
.
Please
kindly
advise
the
next
steps
in
processing
this
transfer.nl
In
addition
,
I
am
wondering
whether
you
are
able
to
tell
me
whether
next
academic
year
will
be
remote
learning
based
?
As
I
am
a
little
out
of
the
loop
being
out
of
study
for
several
months
.
Kind
Regards
.
This
essay
will
establish
that
the
greatest
achievement
of
the
EU
is
peacekeeping
and
war
prevention
and
that
European
integration
across
several
areas
is
integral
to
ensuring
peace
.
Economic
,
cultural
and
legal
integration
will
be
examined
to
evaluate
their
impact
on
the
overall
success
of
the
European
Union
,
drawing
on
citizens
'
opinion
,
empirical
evidence
of
success
and
criticisms
of
each
area
.
However
,
it
will
finally
conclude
that
peace
across
the
continent
is
facilitated
by
cultural
integration
.
Whilst
economic
integration
prevents
declarations
of
war
,
it
is
the
individual
citizens
,
brought
together
through
cultural
integration
that
allows
for
a
closer
union
.
Whilst
co
-
dependence
and
economic
reliance
upon
other
nations
prevents
the
declaration
of
war
due
to
shared
economic
and
monetary
policies
,
which
was
established
by
the
creation
of
the
European
Coal
and
Steel
community
in
1951
.
Ultimately
,
cultural
integration
reduces
opposition
to
further
economic
and
legal
integration
across
EU
members
as
they
grow
closer
to
the
idea
of
a
‘
European
identity
’
.
This
will
further
be
proven
by
the
United
Kingdom
’s
decision
to
leave
the
European
Union
,
of
which
a
large
proportion
of
the
factors
that
contributed
to
the
result
are
cultural
.
Drawing
a
comparison
with
other
regional
organisations
and
their
failures
highlights
the
success
of
the
EU
project
,
particularly
with
its
peacekeeping
efforts
,
and
will
ultimately
conclude
that
cultural
integration
is
more
important
to
peace
and
security
than
economic
integration
in
today
’s
European
society
.
Economic
integration
began
with
the
Treaty
of
Paris
,
signed
in
1951
to
merge
economic
ties
of
6
European
countries
to
create
the
ECSC
.
The
objective
of
this
treaty
was
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
war
by
the
nations
becoming
economically
interdependent
with
one
another
.

Good
Morning
,
I
have
to
retake
the
module
exam
in
July
and
i
am
very
worried
about
the
retake
.
I
struggled
a
lot
both
learning
in
the
lectures
and
whilst
revising
.
I
can
understand
the
content
from
the
first
couple
of
weeks
,
but
beyond
i
am
really
struggling
.
Please
can
you
direct
me
to
help
i
can
receive
to
help
me
understand
the
content
because
i
find
the
revision
packs
do
not
help
me
.
i
am
very
worried
i
will
not
be
able
to
continue
my
course
if
i
fail
again
.
Thank
you
in
advance
.
Good
morning
,
I
need
some
advice
concerning
an
exam
retake
I
have
next
Monday
.
Last
year
I
failed
module
and
I
need
to
retake
it
,
I
struggle
massively
with
the
course
and
I
a
certain
I
will
fail
again
as
I
can
not
understand
the
content
at
all
.
I
have
reached
out
to
my
lecturer
for
the
module
who
has
suggested
I
either
see
him
for
some
help
next
week
once
his
office
hours
are
open
,
but
my
exam
is
at
2
pm
on
that
day
.
I
als
have
the
option
of
recieving
help
from
the
library
,
who
i
have
been
unable
to
contact
.
my
concern
is
that
if
i
fail
again
,
i
will
not
be
allowed
to
continue
my
course
at
university
,
i
feel
that
no
information
about
getting
into
second
year
and
retaking
exams
has
been
made
clear
to
me
.
I
am
now
uncertain
of
my
future
and
unsure
who
to
contact
about
it
.
Say
I
was
to
fail
again
,
what
would
happen
to
me
?
the
lack
of
information
from
my
school
has
caused
a
lot
of
stress
and
anxiety
and
I
have
no
idea
what
to
do
.
I
am
not
sure
about
what
you
know
about
this
or
what
you
can
tell
me
,
but
at
this
point
anything
is
appreciated
to
make
me
feel
less
anxious
about
my
future
at
university

Good
evening
,
Unfortunately
,
I
was
unable
to
attend
the
8669
seminar
on
Friday
2040
November
at
1400
as
I
was
unwell
with
monkey
pox
.
I
had
emailed
Diamond
to
let
her
know
of
my
absence
however
she
did
reply
suggesting
it
was
better
I
was
to
email
you
.
Please
would
you
be
able
to
let
me
know
who
is
in
my
seminar
group
?
I
would
also
like
to
apologise
for
my
absence
.
Apologies
again
,
.
Good
morning
,
I
am
a
second
year
student
at
the
university
and
recently
,
there
has
been
circumstances
which
are
worrying
me
and
are
interfering
with
my
academic
studies
.
Would
I
be
able
to
talk
to
someone
at
the
university
and
work
through
these
issues
and
give
me
some
guidance
on
a
solution
?
Thanks
in
advance
.
i
have
such
a
headache
now
Gon
na
go
for
a
walk
to
clear
my
head
.
At
least
its
done
Ill
try
my
nest
What
the
fuck
Why
Doing
stuff
at
the
very
vwey
last
minute
is
far
too
stressful
So
what
s
happened
with
your
submission
You
know
what
he
does
Just
gon
na
go
with
it
I
do
nt
even
understand
normative
theory
lol
Another
hour
ill
be
done
So
glad
i
did
nt
give
up
lol
Hopefully
its
at
least
40
%
🙏
Tomorrow
we
go
again
Yep
😔
Is
the
extended
deadline
midday
Sunday
or
Saturday
,
Oh
get
in
That
makes
it
easier
So
the
following
Friday
for
the
module
one
whooooo
For
the
CEO
's
day
at
Helsinki
I
have
suggested
for
them
to
stay
in
the
Hilton
Helsinki
strand
which
costs
$
130
a
night
,
it
is
close
to
the
water
and
is
near
to
the
central
of
Helsinki
,
so
they
will
be
capable
of
travelling
for
not
a
long
amount
of
time
.
Secondly
,
a
cafÃ
©
I
have
recommended
is
the
Fazer
Cafe
Kluuvikata
3
.
They
will
be
capable
of
sitting
inside
and
outside
and
is
not
far
from
the
water
as
well
.
It
is
a
little
pricey
but
the
reviews
haves
suggested
that
it
is
great
,
especially
with
the
timing
from
8
am
to
7
pm
,
the
CEO
will
be
able
to
attend
the
cafÃ
©
from
morning
to
evening
.
A
museum
to
attend
is
the
museum
of
contemporary
art
museum
,
which
is
located
in
the
central
of
Helsinki
.
It
costs
$
0
-
15
,
but
with
the
small
price
to
pay
it
is
a
beautiful
setting
to
observe
the
art
pieces
on
show
.
For
a
restaurant
meal
I
have
stated
that
the
Restaurant
Saaga
as
it
serves
the
national
dish
called
the
PoronkÃ¤ristys
.
The
reviews
say
that
the
place
has
great
ambiance
.
It
also
serves
a
vegetarian
option
as
well
as
an
all
you
can
eat
buffet
which
really
provides
a
lot
of
options
.
A
gift
shop
which
is
fairly
close
is
the
Kanturin
Tupa
shop
,
it
provides
all
the
gifts
necessary
for
her
kids
to
take
home
,
it
is
also
relatively
close
.
Finally
,
to
end
the
trip
a
concert
on
the
4th
of
September
to
listen
to
the
band
featuring
Lauri
Tahka
.
This
will
be
occurring
in
the
Bolt
Arena
which
is
located
further
North
but
still
in
close
distance
.
That
really
helps
,
I
’ll
try
take
it
on
board
when
writing
up
the
introduction
!
Thank
you
.
.
Hello
,
Thank
you
very
much
for
this
advice
,
I
appreciate
it
.
I
will
definitely
check
into
this
!
.
Hello
,
My
name
is
.
,
I
am
a
final
year
computer
science
student
at
university
who
will
be
graduating
this
year
around
JuneSeptember
.
I
was
wondering
if
this
programme
was
still
be
open
after
this
time
as
I
would
gladly
love
to
apply
and
attend
the
physics
programme
after
I
have
graduated
.
If
there
are
any
other
opportunities
available
can
you
please
let
me
know
.
Thank
you
!
.
Hey
,
I
believe
I
have
finally
gotten
120
participants
!
Let
me
know
when
we
can
arrange
a
meeting
next
.
.
Yes
that
would
be
perfect
thank
you
!
Hi
,
Any
day
and
time
next
week
is
fine
,
preferably
a
Friday
or
Wednesday
?
I
will
make
sure
to
have
a
draft
example
for
the
next
meeting
to
see
if
I
had
done
it
correctly
.
I
still
have
a
few
uncertainties
but
I
can
address
them
next
time
.
.
Hi
,
I
have
just
done
that
now
.
Thank
you
!
.
Hi
!
That
does
help
,
I
was
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
put
in
the
introduction
as
the
topic
section
is
smaller
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
predictors
when
it
comes
to
theoretical
background
.
But
I
might
examine
it
as
exploratory
if
I
have
the
word
count
.
Thank
you
!
Hi
,
In
literature
I
have
realised
that
there
are
gender
differences
within
topic
,
topic
,
and
topic
.
Would
it
be
possible
to
say
that
a
certain
predictor
could
vary
on
the
basis
of
gender
.
Or
should
I
leave
this
explanation
for
the
discussion
to
explain
in
more
detail
later
,
as
I
was
placing
this
in
my
introduction
.
If
not
,
how
could
I
test
for
this
?
Would
I
have
to
go
back
to
my
regression
analysis
to
check
this
further
?
As
comparing
femalesmales
against
topictopictopic
and
topic
,
confuses
me
a
little
.
Thank
you
!
.
In
the
United
Kingdom
in
2019
there
was
1.6
%
of
children
with
Autism
Spectrum
Disorder
.
Therefore
,
the
use
of
a
robot
could
be
more
beneficial
and
less
time
consuming
when
gaining
information
from
a
child
.
In
summary
,
the
evidence
above
provides
the
KASPAR
to
accomplish
what
a
human
interviewer
might
not
be
able
to
in
a
cognitive
interview
.
It
suggests
that
the
KASPAR
can
aid
children
in
feeling
relaxed
,
as
this
is
important
in
salvaging
memories
of
the
witnessed
event
.
But
most
importantly
it
can
help
the
police
interviewers
by
acting
as
a
social
mediator
between
the
child
and
the
interviewer
.
Police
should
therefore
highly
consider
the
use
of
a
KASPAR
for
ASD
children
.
To
conclude
,
both
uses
of
a
sketch
-
RC
and
a
humanoid
robot
appear
to
support
ASD
children
in
memory
.
Sketch
-
RC
is
an
improvement
from
the
standard
MRC
as
it
visually
helps
ASD
children
to
see
the
contextual
cues
.
The
KASPAR
also
helps
benefit
in
the
interaction
of
the
ASD
child
and
the
interviewer
,
which
in
turn
allows
the
child
to
feel
at
ease
and
not
impede
their
memory
.
Both
recommendations
have
a
significant
amount
of
evidence
to
support
their
use
,
yet
there
have
been
a
few
limitations
which
interferes
in
their
validity
of
being
useful
.
It
should
however
still
be
considered
in
the
use
of
police
interviews
.
no
sorry
,
I
have
been
looking
at
an
older
version
of
my
research
protocol
!
That
makes
me
feel
so
much
better
.
I
apologise
for
the
worry
.
Thank
you
for
all
the
help
!
.
Okay
thank
you
!
Last
question
I
promise
!
I
have
realised
I
made
topic
a
non
-
directional
hypothesis
as
well
as
topic
,
and
I
am
unsure
if
that
was
the
correct
decision
at
the
time
as
reading
more
into
it
there
is
somewhat
of
a
direction
to
it
.
Or
should
I
keep
it
as
is
,
but
include
into
my
first
regression
model
?
A
little
stuck
now
.
But
thank
you
for
clearing
up
on
the
topic
.
.
Hi
,
Sorry
I
just
have
one
more
question
.
In
my
research
protocol
I
stated
that
topic
would
be
a
non
-
directional
hypothesis
‘
topic
will
be
related
to
topic
‘
but
when
we
did
the
multiple
regression
model
we
did
not
include
it
.
Is
it
still
okay
to
not
include
it
?
As
literature
in
this
area
is
inconsistent
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
Yes
that
would
be
perfect
!
Thank
you
!
Hi
,
Sorry
I
did
n’t
receive
this
email
until
now
for
some
reason
.
And
no
it
’s
okay
I
would
rather
do
it
next
week
so
I
can
wrap
my
head
around
statistics
.
If
that
is
okay
?
Thank
you
!
.
Hi
,
Would
it
be
possible
to
schedule
a
meeting
on
WednesdaySaturday
?
I
have
a
few
questions
on
the
Results
section
,
just
want
to
see
if
I
am
doing
it
correctly
.
If
that
’s
possible
.
Thank
you
!
.
Hi
,
Thank
you
for
the
clarification
.
I
appreciate
it
!
.
Hi
,
It
’s
on
system
,
the
marks
section
.
.
Hi
,
I
have
just
received
my
grade
back
and
I
am
unsure
if
it
is
73
%
or
66
%
as
it
states
73109
.
Is
it
not
out
of
100
?
Sorry
for
any
inconvenience
.
Thank
you
,
.
It
?
Okay
Is
it
an
app
Oh
lol
?
Just
use
my
email
Oh
no
Why
You
have
to
pay
?
No
You
have
to
pay
to
get
in
?
Oh
nah
I
’m
good
I
do
n’t
hand
my
bank
account
that
easily
No
,
I
do
n’t
like
giving
my
bank
out
So
nope
😂
if
you
’re
lucky
you
’ll
win
do
n’t
need
to
cheat
A
shoe
?
Again
You
’re
acc
mad
Loool
do
it
yourself
Watch
should
we
get
mum
then
?
Dickhead
Should
I
get
her
the
top
then
?
A
foot
massager
?
Yeah
Just
eat
has
20
%
You
have
to
have
my
account
There
’s
no
code
Check
the
For
You
section
is
just
eat
That
’s
where
it
should
be
still
have
loads
of
time
You
’re
young
Oh
no
I
would
n’t
You
need
to
be
100
%
Of
courseee
,
I
would
n’t
introduce
him
You
need
to
be
confident
that
it
’ll
last
I
’m
going
to
say
this
as
a
friend
but
no
offence
,
I
wish
you
would
find
someone
better
.
Who
treats
you
the
way
you
deserve
,
I
wish
you
could
be
happy
and
with
someone
you
could
trust
all
the
time
.
It
will
be
hard
to
meet
someone
at
first
but
you
have
loads
of
time
to
find
then
.
And
I
’m
hoping
that
time
will
be
in
your
next
two
years
I
’d
suggest
you
do
this
!
You
need
to
go
out
and
meet
new
people
,
you
being
stuck
with
Emmye
stops
you
from
that
.
Fuck
what
he
says
,
he
’s
3842
and
has
had
all
the
time
to
do
it
so
now
it
’s
your
time
to
do
it
Faces
are
vital
in
conveying
emotions
and
allowing
humans
to
nonverbally
interact
with
each
other
had
found
that
the
neurotypical
individuals
still
managed
to
incorrectly
recognise
anger
as
disgust
10
%
of
the
time
.
This
further
complicates
the
BET
,
as
it
shows
to
not
be
as
hardwired
as
it
mentions
.
To
conclude
the
two
opposing
theories
of
facial
recognition
of
emotion
have
two
different
fields
of
research
.
A
large
body
of
evidence
in
cultural
differences
has
come
to
show
that
the
BECV
theory
has
been
an
appropriate
theoretical
model
to
explain
why
facial
recognition
is
not
universal
,
additionally
,
evidence
in
the
field
of
neuropsychology
challenges
the
BET
model
.
The
converging
evidence
in
these
two
fields
has
still
come
to
show
that
the
universality
thesis
can
be
refuted
.
is
he
scared
?
No
I
get
it
...
But
if
you
’re
unhappy
you
have
to
do
it
Omg
dw
😂
I
know
how
you
feel
Relationships
are
super
hard
man
:
Same
:(
Definitely
...
you
see
how
he
reacts
under
these
circumstances
Well
I
hope
you
see
how
things
go
and
make
your
mind
up
x
I
’ll
always
be
here
for
you
when
you
need
💕
😂
😂
it
’s
okay
xx
Yeah
sure
let
me
look
it
up
I
’m
hoping
it
’s
correct
Yeahh
of
course
😓
Wtf

...
she
has
no
life
Clearly
no
one

👀

Dumb

things
Tell

comes
It

I
ca
n’t
bring
it
here
you
idiot
How
would
I
bring
it
back
Dear
Professor
Ilona
,
My
query
is
regrading
the
APA
tables
and
figures
placed
in
the
Final
Year
Project
,
do
they
count
towards
the
word
count
?
They
take
up
a
considerable
amount
of
words
and
was
wondering
on
the
final
submission
if
they
will
count
to
the
overall
8000
words
.
Thank
you
.
Sincerely
,

Hello
,
Hope
you
’re
doing
well
.
I
just
wanted
to
make
sure
you
received
the
FYP
draft
because
the
wifi
here
is
terrible
and
I
am
not
sure
if
it
sent
through
or
not
.
If
it
has
,
I
hope
it
is
not
too
terrible
and
not
taking
a
whole
lot
of
your
time
.
Thank
you
!

Hello

Thank

so
much
for
the
feedback

I
am
going
over
it

hopefully
will
complete
it
ASAP
.
Very
detailed
and
constructive
feedback
,
I
appreciate
it
thoroughly
!
Is
it
possible
to
arrange
a
meeting
next

to
go
over
some
questions
I

Hello
,
Good
morning
,
hope
everything
is
well
!
I
just
have
a
general
question
based
on
the
discussion
,
so
the
methodological
and
theoretical
implications
on
why
the
study
did
not
turn
out
the
way
it
did
,
would
that
be
a
separate
section
or
would
they
be
embedded
when
talking
about
each
predictor
from
the
global
model
?
Because
I
have
the
content
on
why
each
predictor
was
not
significant
both
the
theoretical
and
methodological
explanation
but
not
sure
how
to
layout
the
discussion
to
not
repeat
myself
in
the
limitations
and
application
section
.
I
am
aware
that
there
is
no
right
answer
but
I
am
a
little
worried
that
it
will
look
a
little
messy
.
I
hope
this
makes
sense
.
If
you
are
unable
to
answer
this
type
of
discussion
question
I
will
understand
.
Thank
you
,
.
Okay
that
helps
ease
my
nerves
and
makes
sense
!
Thank
you
for
the
clarification
!

Hi
,
The
article
does
seem
to
mention
which
questions
are
reversed
but
does
n’t
mention
when
we
can
assess
the
participant
as
‘
academic
procrastinators
’
.
One
study
which
did
use
it
had
mentioned
that
80
or
above
score
is
when
they
can
be
classed
as
procrastinators
.
And
yes
I
should
probably
include
the
six
factors
into
my
ethics
.
I
’ll
probably
send
the
documents
over
by
the
end
of
the
day
.
.
Hi
!
For
some
reason
I
am
unable
to
find
the
scoring
of
the
Academic
Procrastination
Scale
.
What
should
I
do
in
this
case
?
I
know
the
6
main
groups
the
participants
can
fall
into
as
it
is
mentioned
but
it
does
not
specifically
say
which
items
these
are
.
.
Hi
I
was
wondering
if
I
had
to
include
the
data
protection
information
in
the
Qualtrics
.
I
have
completed
pretty
much
most
of
my
Qualtrics
but
I
’m
unsure
of
what
I
am
missing
at
the
moment
.
Can
you
have
a
look
and
see
what
else
is
needed
?
Thank
you
!

Hi
,
I
hope
you
’ve
had
a
good
Christmas
and
New
Years
aswell
!
I
’m
still
a
little
worried
that
33
responses
is
n’t
enough
for
the
FYP
.
I
have
been
advertising
it
through
the
anonymous
link
so
far
but
still
hardly
any
responses
.
And
yes
I
would
be
happy
for
a
progress
meeting
before
Thursday
at
any
time
point
!
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
Would
it
be
okay
to
have
a
meeting
around
11
or
12
tomorrow
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
,
I
had
two
small
questions
about
the
introduction
for
the
FYP
.
Would
it
be
better
to
separate
the
introduction
into
predictors
,
I
’ve
seen
some
articles
do
it
for
example
:
1.2
.
‘
topic
as
a
predictor
’
1.3
topic
a
s
a
predictor
and
etc
...
or
should
I
interlink
both
?
Do
the
articles
have
to
be
from
2010
-
2021
,
as
it
is
considered
the
most
recent
research
or
am
I
allowed
to
use
older
research
in
the
90
’s
or
80
’s
?
I
only
ask
because
one
of
our
essays
stated
that
it
is
better
to
use
up
to
date
research
.
Thank
you
!

Hi
,
Thanks
for
looking
back
into
this
.
My
question
was
regarding
Sam
’s
experiment
.
I
used
the
effect
size
of
medium
0.15
,
as
I
could
n’t
find
any
literature
which
had
Cohen
’s
f
or
d.
And
I
was
given
a
total
sample
size
of
92
.
If
my
results
are
not
significant
but
I
have
more
than
enough
participants
to
show
that
there
was
an
effect
,
would
my
study
just
be
limited
on
other
factors
and
not
by
the
effect
size
.
Ps
.
Thank
you
for
helping
my
friend
,
she
was
super
happy
with
the
advice
given
!
.
Dear
Dr.
Arliene
,
Thank
you
for
following
up
on
this
inquiry
.
Sincerely
,
.
Dear
Dr.
Heide
,
It
has
come
to
my
attention
that
the
module
has
changed
to
a
summer
exam
.
Myself
and
other
individuals
from
the
course
have
expressed
that
they
are
worried
that
with
three
exams
within
a
week
might
be
really
hard
to
do
,
especially
since
there
are
4
questions
to
this
exam
.
Are
there
any
extension
or
additions
that
can
help
with
this
?
For
instance
maybe
making
it
seen
beforehand
?
As
we
find
it
unfair
that
some
individuals
will
only
have
two
exams
within
a
week
and
might
hinder
us
to
getting
top
grades
.
I
will
appreciate
any
comments
.
Thank
you
.
Sincerely
,
.
Thank
you
for
clarifying
this
further
,
I
appreciate
it
!

Hi
!
I
am
a
bit
stuck
on
the
underlying
explanation
of
statistics
:
topic
with
topic
.
So
in
terms
of
my
results
topic
and
topic
were
positively
significant
in
the
correlation
but
not
in
the
global
model
when
conducting
regression
.
However
,
if
you
recall
topic
alone
was
a
significant
predictor
of
topic
in
the
regression
.
Does
that
mean
the
addition
of
over
the
variables
in
the
model
might
overpower
topic
,
in
this
case
topic
?
Sorry
I
am
just
confused
on
discussing
this
predictor
as
it
is
more
complex
than
the
others
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
Doing
okay
I
guess
,
considering
I
’m
still
doing
the
FYP
it
is
still
a
bit
worrying
😂
.
And
thank
you
for
clarifying
!
I
have
mentioned
f
-
squared
as
f2
,
so
I
assume
that
’s
okay
.
Thank
you
again
,
.
Hello
,
Hope
you
are
doing
well
!
Just
to
clarify
,
would
you
still
like
me
to
send
over
the
appendix
to
you
via
email
as
it
is
not
included
in
the
final
submission
.
Also
,
I
am
worried
that
the
markers
will
not
see
the
appendix
’
when
referring
to
them
in
the
report
e.g.
Low
=
4158
Moderate
=
5040
High
=
10080
With
a
total
score
of
19278
and
0
as
the
lowest
number
with
no
PA
.
So
the
median
would
be
9639
.
Whereas
the
actual
score
for
the
present
study
was
2546.38
.
I
feel
like
this
is
too
low
and
might
be
not
correct
?
If
you
are
unable
to
answer
this
question
,
then
that
is
fine
!
Just
wanted
to
double
check
.
Thank
you
,
.
t
’s
never
going
to
change
:
Why
do
n’t
you
guys
take
a
break
?
He
’s
never
going
to
move
out
...
I
’m
saying
that
now
Do
n’t
think
like
that
.
He
chose
you
for
a
reason
over
her
No
do
n’t
say
that
Forget
that
disgusting
woman
I
know
but
just
do
n’t
mention
it
.
Its
about
you
and
him
,
not
her
atm
Derrick
:(
I
really
do
think
you
deserve
better
but
you
do
love
him
so
that
’s
important
too
But
you
’re
clearly
not
happy
Talk
to
him
,
do
n’t
rush
this
.
If
it
is
going
to
lead
to
breaking
up
then
you
do
need
to
think
about
this
first
...
it
might
seriously
be
the
lockdown
getting
to
you
Like
afterwards
it
might
be
different
Have
you
talked
to
him
about
this
tho
?
Does
he
have
something
to
hide
?
Like
have
you
checked
Of
course
...
and
all
those
times
were
horrible
So
you
have
a
right
to
feel
that
way
And
you
’ve
lost
your
trust
You
need
to
build
it
,
and
if
he
keeps
hiding
his
phone
then
it
’ll
never
Be
built
You
’re
not
an
idiot
...
it
’s
just
you
seriously
love
him
and
you
give
him
all
these
chances
but
he
just
screws
it
up
because
he
does
n’t
know
that
what
he
has
with
you
is
special
.
He
’s
the
biggest
dickhead
ever
.
If
he
does
n’t
give
you
his
phone
and
let
you
trust
him
then
I
would
just
leave
because
there
’s
bound
to
be
something
he
does
n’t
want
you
to
see
.
Thank
you
!
Whenever

n’t
too
late

you

We

20
minutes

so

Hi

That
would

nice

when

you

this

Hi
,
I
have
just
received
my
feedback
on
my
poster
,
which
is
relatively
quick
.
I
ended
up
getting
all
B+
with
only
two
as
just
B.
Just
to
ease
my
nerves
a
little
bit
,
do
you
have
any
idea
if
this
could
be
a
2:1
or
low
first
.
Just
a
little
bit
worried
.
Thank
you

Hi
,
Quick
question
,
when
sending
the
draft
to
you
,
will
I
have
to
include
the
SPSS
data
output
and
appendix
?
Just
double
checking
as
the
guidelines
do
not
really
specify
this
?
All
the
best

.
Hi
,
I
am
good
,
hope
you
are
well
as
well
.
Thank
you
for
clarifying
,
I
will
be
including
an
Appendix
as
it
is
pretty
much
complete
.
I
was
just
worried
that
the
actual
marker
will
not
receive
the
Appendix
in
the
final
draft
and
might
not
see
certain
figures
which
are
not
too
important
in
the
report
but
have
a
visual
representation
for
certain
resultstables
.
Thank

Autism
Spectrum
disorder
,
which
RBCH
can
not
explain
as
the
‘
da
’
is
loaded
to
the
buffer
first
and
identical
.
In
conclusion
,
there
are
numerous
accounts
explaining
cognitive
difficulties
in
AoS.
All
accounts
above
can
propose
for
groping
and
have
similaritiescontrasts
of
their
perspectives
of
why
impairments
occur
in
AS
.
However
,
experimental
tasks
aforementioned
are
limited
as
results
may
differ
ranging
from
the
severity
of
impairments
,
as
brain
damage
and
addition
of
Aphasia
in
some
speakers
could
yield
different
results
.
Therefore
,
there
is
n’t
one
account
which
can
explain
all
cognitive

of
AoS
as
results
for
experiments
are
inconsistent

Further

can
help
tailor
treatments

what

As

Hi
Huey
,
Not
sure
what
you
mean
by
a
blocked
order
.
Does
this
mean
all
no
load
trials
presented
and
then
all
positive
trials
presented
and
then
all
negative
trials
presented
and
this
would
be
counter
balanced
so
some
participants
would
get
all
negative
trials
first
and
then
all
positive
trials
and
then
all
no
load
conditions
.
And
this
would
be
based
on
the
B
-
G
list
you
gave
me
?
And
the
powerpoint
I
sent
you
is
version
A
and
would
that
be
the
mixed
condition
?
So
half
pps
would
get
no
load
,
positive
,
negative
,
no
load
,
positive
,
negative
.
Or
do
I
need
to
change
this
to
also
be
mixed
so
for
example
no
load
trial
,
positive
trial
,
negative
trial
and
then
positive
trial
,
negative
trial
and
no
load
trial
.
Or
do
I
just
let
half
pps
do
version
A
that
I
sent
you
and
leave
that
how
it
is
and
the
other
half
just
do
the
B
-
G
blocked
condition
which
will
be
randomised
.
Also
want
to
say
about
the
amount
of
pps
as
contact
hours
are
max
30
so
this
would
mean
only
able
to
get
40
pps
instead
of
planned
60
.
Thank
you
for
your
help
again
!

Kind
regards

Hi
Carmelina
,
Was
wondering
if
I
should
do
a
qualtrics
version
of
the
topic
or
give
pps
a
link
to
the
PDF
file
and
email
them
after
the
study
?
Kind

Hi
,
Did
nt
know
changing
some
bits
in
the
description
would
require
re
-
approval
.
Added
time
slots
would
be
great
if
you
could
approve
this
again
.
Thank
you
!

Hi
Sophie
,
I
have
compiled
a
itinerary
of
all
the
things
you
would
want
to
do
on
your
trip
to
Helsinki
for
your
two
-
day
conference
on
the
2nd-4th
September
.
Firstly
,
I
have
found
a
hotel
called
the
Radisson
Blue
seaside
hotel
as
i
know
you
like
the
water
and
would
want
to
be
near
it
,
this
hotel
is
only
1
mile
away
from
the
Hetrikani
beach
and
has
stunning
ocean
views
from
the
room
.
it
is
Â£77
a
night
within
your
budget
and
has
many
features
such
as
AC
,
barlounge
,
a
gym
in
case
you
would
want
to
blow
off
any
steam
from
the
conference
.
It
has
many
positive
reviews
and
is
deemed
one
of
the
best
in
Helsinki
!
It
also
is
near
many
great
sights
so
travelling
will
be
very
convenient
.
It
is
6
mins
from
a
museum
as
well
as
2
mins
from
a
escape
room
in
case
you
would
want
to
partake
any
other
activities
during
your
trip
.
The
cafe
I
found
for
you
to
have
breakfast
at
is
called
Eckberg
cafe
and
is
only
a
12
min
walk
away
from
the
hotel
and
they
have
many
positive
reviews
and
the
images
of
the
food
also
look
amazing
!
The
national
museum
of
Finland
are
home
to
many
artefacts
and
feature
a
great
deal
of
history
which
will
be
perfect
for
you
to
get
to
know
the
history
of
the
place
and
is
only
a
20
minute
metro
journey
from
the
hotel
,
with
the
metro
also
near
the
hotel
,
perfect
for
travelling
there
!
In
terms
of
the
restaurant
,
I
found
the
restaurant
Olo
for
you
,
it
has
a
unique
ambience
with
amazing
food
and
are
cautious
with
dietary
requirements
as
I
know
you
are
allergic
to
shellfish
.
This
restaurant
is
also
close
by
to
the
hotel
being
19
mins
away
!
The
lioporo
gift
shop
is
also
home
to
some
amazing
handmade
souvenir
and
typical
souvenirs
so
you
can
get
authentic
gifts
for
your
children
,
and
again
this
is
all
close
by
so
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
not
having
time
due
to
your
busy
schedule
!
Finally
,
I
know
you
wanted
a
nice
live
music
venue
to
wind
down
in
the
evenings
and
I
have
found
the
Tavasata
which
is
the
no.1
live
music
venue
in
Helsinki
and
is
described
as
legendary
and
iconic
and
is
only
6
mins
away
!
I
will
confer
with
you
later
about
all
these
places
and
I
hope
they
are
to
your
liking
.
Best
wishes
,
Sobia
whom
it
may
concern
,
I
placed
an
order
for
the
product
cream
-
order
ID
1786
,
this
arrived
on
the
2624
December
but
I
had
n’t
used
it
yet
as
I
had
a
previous
bottle
I
purchased
from
amazon
which
I
had
yet
to
finish
.
I
was
n’t
aware
initially
product
had
their
own
website
and
decided
to
purchase
the
next
bottle
from
your
website
due
to
the
cheaper
price
compared
to
Amazon
.
However
,
I
was
very
disappointed
to
find
that
the
pump
is
broken
and
would
not
let
me
dispense
any
cream
out
.
I
have
tried
many
ways
to
get
the
pump
to
work
but
to
no
avail
.
product
is
a
very
expensive
cream
to
purchase
and
for
a
£
50
cream
one
would
expect
it
to
actually
dispense
the
cream
.
As
someone
with
monkey
pox
I
would
hope
the
cream
would
help
me
with
my
condition
especially
with
the
price
tag
attached
but
this
is
n’t
even
possible
due
to
the
actual
components
of
the
product
not
being
up
to
par
.
I
do
nt
mean
to
sound
standoffish
but
spending
so
much
money
on
a
cream
for
it
to
not
actually
work
properly
is
quite
frustrating
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
about
this
problem
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
,
I
would
like
to
review
the
product
on
Facebook
and
trust
pilot
so
I
can
get
the
20
%
off
code
.
The
best
email
address
would
be

Kind

Hi

Yes
I
would
still

Hi
Michaeline
,
I
’ve
seen
the
video
and
it
is
a
big
improvement
from
the
last
one
I
received
just
a
bit
concerned
over
the
top
two
teeth
.
Looks
like
there
’s
a
little
gap
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
of
my
top
two
teeth
and
I
would
n’t
want
any
gap
between
.
Do
you
see
where
I
’m
coming
from
and
is
there
anything
that
can
be
done
about
this
or
?
Kind

Hi
Lawton
,
I
received
an
email
saying
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
meet
tomorrow
on
a
virtual
meeting
as
it
is
final
year
orientation
day
.
Is
this
something
you
are
able
to
do
tomorrow
afternoon
as
I
know
you
have
other
students
also
I
was
wondering
if
a
phone
call
would
be
better
as
I
do
n’t
have
many
virtual
applications
on
my
phone
or
laptop
and
have
never
used
them
before
and
fear
Of
technical
issues
.
Is
a
phone
call
something
you
are
able
to
accommodate
?
There
is
a
lot
of
uncertainty
right
now
and
I
am
very
uncertain
about
what
the
final
year
is
going
to
entail
so
it
would
be
a
great
chance
to
talk
about
it
with
you
tomorrow
:)
Kind
regards
,
.
,
Just
checking
if
you
could
do
11:10
tomorrow
?
I
will
send
you
the
information
sheet
and
zoom
link
at
that
time
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
I
obtained
your
email
from
Jesus
about
inquiring
about
this
study
.
It
is
a
memory
task
which
will
take
place
over
zoom
.
You
will
be
asked
to
recall
and
retrieve
your
own
memories
and
some
words
.
It
will
roughly
take
about
35
mins
to
complete
.
What
days
and
times
would
you
be
free
this
week
?
Thank
you
,
Kind
regards

Hi
Nicoline
,
My

abrupt

Hi
Katine
,
I
was
just
wondering
as
there
were
different
versions
of
the
experiment
the
cue
words
were
shown
in
a
different
order
,
thus
should
I
do
40
sheets
for
each
participant
or
should
I
do
a
sheet
solely
for
version
A
,
another
sheet
solely
for
version
B
etc
.
Furthermore
,
will
I
have
to
send
you
the
excel
sheets
for
the
40
pps
and
should
I
also
stick
to
40pps
on
excel
or
should
I
do
50
?
Kind
regards

Hi
Graeme
,
I
was
wondering
if
it
was
possible
for
me
to
download
SPSS
on
my
home
laptop
due
to
it
being
for
my
FYP
and
if
you
could
assist
me
in
this
?
Kind

Hi
Cassondra
,
I
was
mainly
just
wondering
what
I
would
have
to
do
on
SPSS
,
would
this
just
be
the
topic
analysis
?
I
know
I
have
to
do
reaction
times
and
code
the
memories
but
would
that
just
be
on
excel
?
Kind

Hi
Casper
,
I
have
managed
to
obtain
50
participants
now
,
I
just
had
a
few
questions
about
using
SPSS
for
analysis
,
which
I
was
hoping
to
ask
tomorrow
,
I
have
n’t
started
data
analysis
yet
,
but
I
think
a
40
minute
appointment
on
Thursday
would
be
better
instead
?
Kind
regards
,
.
Is
1:50
okay
?
Sorry
for
changing
the
times

Hi
,
Thank
you
for
your
response
!
So
just
to
confirm
,
knowledge
of
the
spatio
-
temporal
parameters
to
produce
phonemes
and
the
loss
of
knowledge
of
word
-
sized
articulatory
programmes
fall
under
the
same
hypothesis
of
impairment
in
knowledge
?
Was
also
wondering
if
you
want
us
to
present
all
different
accounts
due
to
the
tight
word
limit
?
Kind
regards
,

Hi
Debee
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
just
have
a
question
regarding
the
interpretations
of
Apraxia
.
I
’m
not
sure
if
there
are
numerous
hypothesis
or
if
these
are
sub
-
types
which
fall
under
the
same
hypothesis
.
For
example
;
is
the
knowledge
of
the
spatio
-
temporal
parameters
associated
to
speech
has
become
imprecise
,
as
well
as
the
loss
of
knowledge
of
word
sized-
articulatory
programmes
fall
under
the
same
hypothesis
of
an
impairment
In
knowledge
or
are
they
two
different
hypothesis
.
Furthermore
,
is
the
buffer
limitation
and
reduced
efficiency
of
the
articulatory
planner
fall
under
the
umbrella
of
the
limitation
in
resources
required
for
motor
planning
,
or
are
they
two
different
hypothesis
?
I
was
also
hoping
you
would
be
able
to
explain
the
spatio
-
temporal
paramaters
associated
to
speech
has
become
imprecise
as
I
find
it
confusing
and
the
reading
had
n’t
helped
also
.
Thank
you
,

Hi
Spense
,
Unfortunately
I
have
only
received
one
participant
yet
and
need
39
more
.
I
have
added
multiple
more
time
slots
for
the
coming
week
on
system
and
was
wondering
if
we
are
able
to
get
friends
to
possibly
do
the
experiment
too
if
I
am
not
able
to
get
enough
numbers
.
The
experiment
went
well
on
ppt
and
zoom
,
however
,
on
Qualtrics
I
am
receiving
responses
for
the
PIS
but
have
not
got
any
more
sign
ups
for
my
study
I
was
wondering
why
this
was
?
My
one
participant
said
he
was
able
to
sign
up
to
a
timeslot
and
Qualtrics
and
everything
was
fine
for
him
just
wondering
what
the
problem
is
for
the
others
?
Kind
regards
,

Hi
Marve
,
I
’m
doing
a
study
for
my
final
year
project
.
It
takes
place
over
zoom
and
is
a
memory
task
.
It
’ll
take
about
35
mins
to
complete
,
which
I
know
is
long
,
so
was
wondering
if
you
were
available
if
you
were
willing
to
do
it
?
And
if
you
were
,
which
days
you
would
be
free
if
that
was
either
today
or
some
day
next
week
?

Hi

Is
2:45
a
good
time
for
you
to
do
the
study
?
.
Hi
Rickie
,
Could
you
just
fill
out
this
information
sheet
,
once
you
've
done
it
'll
just
redirect
you
to
a
log
in
page
which
just

Will

the

Thank

Alister
,
I
know
its
late
but
just
finished
the
study
hopefully
it
will
be
to
your
liking
.
I
did
this
as
neautral
no
load
,
neg
and
then
positive
.
Was
wondering
about
how
we
would
counterbalance
this
and
the
best
way
you
want
me
to
do
this
ie
.
If
you
want
me
to
change
the
stimuli
ie
mix
up
stimuli
ie
.
Happy
and
fun
for
one
participant
and
happy
and
love
for
another
participant
or
If
you
wanna
mix
up
the
slide
numbers
.
In
addition
,
I
know
you
said
about
blocks
vs
trials
so
wondered
how
this
would
all
factor
as
I
know
you
said
about
giving
half
the
pps
a
blocked
version
and
another
a
randomised
order
.
So
do
I
give
half
pps
the
same
ppt
and
the
other
half
a
counterbalanced
one
Furthermore
,
as
the
contact
hours
are
max
30
hours
for
pps
and
our
study
would
take
45
mins
approx
.
This
would
mean
we
would
need
40
pps
instead
of
the
planned
60
so
was
also
wondering
how
this
change
would
work
Sorry
for
all
the
bother
I
appreciate
our
help
so
much
!
Thank
you
,
Kind
regards
,
.

Hi
Nathanial
,
Discussing
my
project
with
a
friend
and
he
said
you
can
set
a
timer
on
Qualtrics
and
Artur
has
done
a
video
discussing
this
.
Will
watch
the
video
and
see
if
this
is
pheasible
on
Qualtrics
and
send
you
a
link
for
a
study
done
for
1
participant
.
Qualtrics
will
be
easier
for
data
collection
and
if
not
will
make
a

for
1
participant

Good
morning
Alonso
,
I
hope
that
you
are
well
.
I
wanted
to
update
you
on
my
progress
with
my
dissertation
research
for
my
proposal
and
what
further
steps
I
can
take
with
my
proposal
in
the
meantime
.
I
have
a
high
number
of
sources
and
want
to
make
a
start
on
my
proposal
so
I
have
adequate
to
perfect
it
.
Do
you
have
any
examples
of
structure
and
guidance
that
I
can
use
for
my
proposal
?
Furthermore
,
I
have
some
questions
from
one
of
my
colleagues
whose
supervisor
has
not
been
responding
.
Firstly
,
are
case
studies
a
part
of
the
literature
review
or
the
research
designmethodology
when
you
are
reviewing
effects
on
the
case
studies
?
Secondly
,
for
the
literature
review
in
the
proposal
are
we
meant
to
highlight
key
areas
as
the
entire
literature
would
be
exceedingly
long
.
Any
assistance
that
you
can
offer
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Kind
regards
,
.

implement
primary
research
in

the
topic
or
if
it
is
possible
.
Hopefully
we
can
talk
about
it
this

This
essay
will
look
to
answer
the
question
above
,
‘
To
what
extent
does
sport
foster
and
reproduce
a
hyper
-
consumerist
culture
?
’
.
Hyper
-
consumerism
refers
to
‘
the
consumption
of
goods
for
non
-
functional
purposes
and
the
associated
significant
pressure
to
consume
those
goods
,
exerted
by
modern
capitalist
society
,
as
those
goods
shape
one
’s
identity
’
there
was
still
significant
consumer
spending
on
sport
showing
the
level
of
consumers
wants
and
needs
to
spend
on
the
non
-
functional
goods
or
services
.
This
growth
in
the
market
even
in
the
pandemic
is
far
greater
than
other
non
-
functional
goods
in
this
time
and
show
the
nature
of
sports
fostering
and
reproducing
hyper
-
consumerism
.
Throughout
this
essay
I
have
compared
aspects
in
which
that
sport
both
does
foster
and
reproduce
hyper
-
consumerism
but
also
does
n’t
.
The
aspects
that
sport
shows
to
foster
and
reproduce
is
through
the
growth
of
popular
leagues
such
as
the
English
Premier
League
and
these
top
leagues
promoting
a
lifestyle
,
the
growing
of
UK
household
expenditure
on
watching
professional
sports
,
sporting
good
brands
promoted
through
professional
sports
such
as
the
NBA
and
the
Air
Jordan
brand
,
expenditure
on
attending
spectator
sports
and
purchases
at
these
events
.
All
these
aspects
promote
a
clear
message
that
sports
play
a
role
in
hyper
-
consumerism
at
the
bare
minimum
.
Whether
sport
‘
fosters
and
reproduces
’
hyper
-
consumerism
is
highly
contestable
.
Shown
by
the
evidence
presented
hyper
-
consumerism
can
exist
and
grow
without
an
overarching
presence
of
sport
,
as
seen
with
the
UAE
in
which
the
average
GDP
per
capita
has
grown
from
$
26,847
in
1975
to
$
69,900
in
2019
.
This
staggering
growth
in
GDP
per
capita
has
caused
a
growth
in
the
consumerist
culture
which
is
highly
focused
on
luxury
consumer
brands
.
This
hyper
-
consumerist
market
exists
in
a
culture
in
which
roughly
only
6
%
of
the
population
plays
a
sport
over
3
times
a
week
.
In
conclusion
,
I
think
that
,
firstly
,
sport
can
foster
and
reproduce
hyper
-
consumerism
.
However
,
I
believe
that
hyper
-
consumerism
does
not
need
sports
to
grow
as
shown
with
the
case
of
the
United
Arab
Emirates
,
although
this
is
a
rarity
and
to
fully
determine
how
common
of
an
occurrence
this
can
be
further
research
needs
to
be
done
.
Finally
,
although
sport
does
foster
hyper
-
consumerism
it
is
only
possible
with
globalisation
and
instead
globalisation
is
the
major
foster
and
reproducer
of
hyper
-
consumerism
and
sports
is
an
area
that
is
consumed
by
the
hyper
-
consumerist
culture
we
have
.

Good
afternoon
Mr
Lyn
,
I
hope
that
you
are
well
.
I
have
been
brainstorming
for
my
coursework
and
I
had
a
question
.
When
you
refer
to
a
new
market
do
you
refer
to
solely
just
a
country
or
is
it
possible
to
enter
a
new
product
market
?
Such
as
business
entering
into
the
footwear
market
.
I
would
love
to
hear
your
thoughts
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Dear

rejected

I
would
like

Good

I
'm
asking
is

to
the
proposal
literature
not
for
the
final

then
how
long

my

word
count
be
,
if
its
in

between

Good
evening
,
I
would
like
to
discuss
how
I
would
be
able
to
change
my
assigned
thesis
supervisor
,
because
my
current
supervisor
is
not
as
helpful
with
regard
to
my
final
year
thesis
.
I
understand
that
this
assignment
would
be
one
of
the
most
important
assignments
that
I
would
need
to
do
in
my
academic
year
and
that
I
would
need
regular
advice
and
support
to
achieve
work
that
is
reflective
of
my
capabilities
,
but
I
am
not
receiving
that
support
currently
from
my
current
supervisor
.
Thank
you

Good
afternoon
,
Thank
you
for
help
,
I
just
have
two
questions
,
since
I
have
n't
left
my
house
meaning
I
have
n't
gone
to
any
specialists
about
it
,
so
would
n't
that
mean
my
form
would
just
be
rejected
automatically
?
Also
,
if
I
am
able
to
submit
in
November
next
year
,
would
that
mean
I
have
to
pay
for
another
year
's
university
fee
and
also
not
graduate
this
year
?
Thank
you
Regards
.
Good
morning
,
if
I
deferred
my

,
would
that

I

would
that
also
mean
I
ca
n't
take
on
a
masters
next

if
I
decide
to
?

you

Good
evening
,
I
would
to
request
to
get
an
extension
for
the
module
essay
.
I
've
really
been
struggling
mentally
and
with
my
module
essay
especially
since
I
've
been
at
home
completely
for
months
due
to
COVID
,
as
I
live
with
vulnerable
family
members
and
did
n't
want
to
go
outside
increasing
their
risk
,
that
's
why
I
've
been
only
going
to
online
lecturers
for
this
module
and
have
barely
left
.
But
these
assignments
at
home
are
really
wearing
me
down
.
Thank
you
Regards
.
Good
afternoon
,
I
remember
reading
that
there
will
be
a
time
during

where

forgot
when

says
we

multiple
drafts

10
%

How

be
looked
over
and
is
the
information
I
wrote
correct
?
Thank

the
Research

or
feedback

the
two
parts
?
Thank

Good
evening
,
I
just
wanted
to
ask
how
many
existing
literatures
I
should
be
using
,
I
do
n't
know
if
the
amount
I
've
used
is
enough
and
after
I
get
this
reply
would
I
be
able
to
send
you
my
proposal
before
I
submit
it
.
Thank
you
Regards
.
Good
afternoon
,
just
emailing
about
my
title
choice
and
some
questions
I
have
.
My
essay
is
going
to
be
about
the
cultural
association
of
a
woman
's
femininity
to
her
fertility
and
how
this
affects
womans
mental
health
.
My
stance
and
what
I
'm
going
to
argue
is
that
'
assignment_title
'
.
Is
this
a
good
title
or
is
too
long
and
broad
?
I
will
be
using
different
studies
like
one
about
jealousy
between
lesbian
couples
on
who
will
be
the
biological
mother
,
studies
on
infertility
and
life
satisfaction
of
women
,
women
's
Infertility
,
and
the
Potential
Identity
of
Biological
Motherhood
etc
.
Thank
you
Regards
Good

literatures
I
should
be
using

I
do
n't
know
if
the
amount
I
've

is

I

my

n't
received
a
response
yet
,
so
I
just
need
some
help
.
Thank

Good
evening
,
Okay
,
I
understand
I
should
focus
on
the
societal
expectations
of
motherhood
since
this
is
the
sociological
understanding
and
not
the
psychological
.
Would
it
be
okay
if
I
made
an
essay
about
'
assignment_title
'
Where
I
will
be
writing
about
Japan
low
birth
rate
being
blamed
on
women
working
and
choosing
to
have
voluntary
infertility
,
which
is
being
said
it
's
because
they
're
imitating
men
,
Hindu
culture
that
states
Pregnancy
is
stated
as
the
start
of
womans
adult
identity
and
Uganda
women
not
being
accepted
to
society
until
they
have
at
least
2
or
more
children
.
Is
it
okay
if
I
do
n't
focus
on
the
UK
?
Yes
,
I
would
like
to
book
an
appointment
please
,
Thank
you

.

Assess
the
performance
of
any
President
of
the
United
States
in
the
context
of
the
respective
period
in
which
they
held
the
office
.
Unlike
many
American
presidents
,
the
significance
of
his
time
in
office
;
his
character
,
values
,
convictions
,
and
affinities
combined
with
the
extraordinary
circumstances
surrounding
the
period
of
his
presidency
,
made
his
term
of
significant
importance
to
historians
and
not
his
personality
and
they
all
agree
he
had
a
huge
input
in
the
tensions
leading
up
to
the
Civil
War
,
but
historians
continue
to
debate
whether
the
Civil
War
that
occurred
right
after
his
administration
was
inevitable
or
not
.
Buchanan
seems
to
have
been
a
president
thrown
into
an
already
fractured
country
,
where
existing
issues
between
the
free
North
and
the
slave
South
escalated
into
non
-
manageable
levels
;
there
were
two
uncompromising
regions
acting
as
two
countries
with
two
distinct
cultures
leaving
modern
-
day
cultural
remnants
.

your
uni
lecturer
?
No
I
just
told
her
I
ca
n't
come
.
Since
Idk
when
I
can
rearrange
it
to
Understanding
what
the
modern
state
is
,
is
linked
to
understanding
its
historical
emergence
and
identifying
its
four
key
characteristics
,
a
claim
over
territory
,
external
and
internal
sovereignty
,
a
claim
to
legitimacy
,
and
bureaucracy
.
A
common
view
is
that
the
modern
state
emerged
when
the
fifteenth
century
absolutist
state
came
to
be
seen
as
separate
from
an
individual
ruler
.
Although
the
concept
of
human
and
animal
nature
being
used
metaphorically
to
describe
an
ideal
or
reality
is
ancient
,
the
emphasis
that
the
two
natures
,
act
as
resources
to
portray
different
qualities
,
is
what
brings
success
in
a
leader
,
is
an
observation
we
can
make
today
.
The
frequent
use
of
verbs
like
,
‘
adopt
’
,
‘
employ
’
‘
disguise
’
and
‘
change
’
connote
a
reassurance
that
leaders
must
only
use
these
animalistic
qualities
on
a
temporary
and
fluctuating
basis
.
Adaptability
and
flexibility
,
not
essentially
prescribed
in
the
essence
of
brute
animal
nature
,
are
still
key
qualities
a
leader
needs
for
success
,
because
in
ones
duration
of
power
,
society
adapts
with
new
challenges
that
arise
,
of
which
leadership
must
respond
to
and
will
do
so
by
adaptation
.
A
close
example
to
show
the
failure
of
adaptation
and
consequent
weak
leadership
is
,
Brexit
.
David
Cameron
’s
departure
,
after
the
referendum
result
suggests
he
had
no
capability
as
well
as
willingness
to
adhere
to
such
change
.
Likewise
,
Theresa
May
’s
catastrophic
turn
of
events
during
the
withdrawal
process
,
represented
by
her
internal
government
unpopularity
,
suggests
how
she
was
unable
to
instil
a
"
strong
and
stable
"
leadership
.
Overall
,
we
can
use
Machiavelli
’s
basic
suggestion
that
in
politics
,
it
is
not
always
rational
to
be
moral
,
as
a
way
of
understanding
the
nature
of
the
modern
state
,
but
must
remember
to
recognise
this
in
the
light
of
different
types
of
morality
.
His
emphasis
on
power
is
valid
when
contemplating
what
will
bring
a
prince
the
ultimate
amount
of
success
and
his
idealist
thoughts
on
the
judgement
by
ethical
standards
is
permissible
because
there
has
and
always
will
be
a
prevalent
distinction
reflected
in
politics
.
His
view
of
human
nature
,
however
,
is
not
useful
as
guidance
in
understanding
how
the
state
should
be
structured
,
as
if
followed
will
lead
to
a
dismal
and
detrimental
society
,
shaped
by
our
own
pessimistic
cultures
.
We
have
seen
that
social
contract
theorists
offer
a
much
more
pleasant
view
of
human
nature
,
so
if
we
truly
wanted
to
live
in
a
harmonious
state
,
that
was
successful
in
all
key
characteristics
than
we
should
look
more
to
the
philosophy
of
Rousseau
.

Hello
,
I
am
having
trouble
navigating
my
school
timetabling
officer
,
as
I
need
to
inform
them
of
a
clash
in
my
timetable
.
As
,
you
are
my
personal
tutor
this
year
,
I
thought
I
would
ask
you
.
Please
can
you
help
?
Thanks
.
I
see
,
thanks
.
It
is
very
confusing
so
I
appreciate
the
breakdown
.
Just
one
more
question
,
how
many
lectures
and
seminars
will
I
have
to
attend
a
week
,
for
that
8159
module
module
?
I
see
,
thanks
for
explaining
that
.
However
,
I
am
confused
about
why
I
have
3
lectures
a
week
for
the
compulsory
module
,
module
[
7548
]
,
plus
a
live
webinar
.
Is
this
the
same
instance
as
the
subject
module
?
Do
I
need
to
attend
them
all
?
That
makes
a
lot
more
sense
now
.
Thank
you
so
much
!
Hello
,
I
was
having
a
bit
of
confusion
trying
to
understand
my
timetable
this
year
,
specifically
regarding
the
Module
,
‘
module
’
.
I
understand
that
the
webinar
for
this
is
on
Wednesdays
4
-
5pm
.
What
day
and
time
is
the
lecture
for
this
module
?
Also
I
understand
that
the
touchpoint
seminars
are
optional
.
However
,
what
information
will
be
covered
in
these
?
And
is
it
different
from
the
webinar
we
’ll
do
at
home
?
Is
it
ok
to
just
attend
the
asynchronous
lecture
,
and
webinar
each
week
?
Will
I
receive
the
sufficient
amount
of
information
,
in
order
to
succeed
in
this
module
?
Please
let
me
know
soon
.
Thanks

Hello
,
We
created
a
new
society
not
long
ago
and
we
’ve
been
experiencing
delay
in
our
process
.
We
understand
this
is
a
busy
time
for
you
.
However
,
we
would
at
least
like
an
update
on
when
things
would
actually
happen
.
Please
could
you
tell
us
when
our
Society
will
be
set
up
on
the
system
?
As
,
we
would
like
to
provide
a
link
on
our
social
medias
of
where
students
can
join
,
and
we
have
already
had
membership
interest
.
We
also
want
to
be
on
the
virtual
fair
,
as
a
new
society
this
may
be
our
only
chance
this
year
to
attract
membership
.
Please
do
get
back
to
me
soon
.
We
are
really
passionate
about
our
initiative
,
and
want
to
showcase
this
is
the
best
way
.
However
,
we
can
not
do
so
without
your
help
,
especially
during
these
early
stages
.
Thank
you
.
yep
Wish
I
could
make
you
one
But
seems
like
an
impossible
wish
😭
I
feel
like
it
’s
so
crazy
how
we
’re
arguably
at
the
most
pivotal
age
of
social
growth
,
gaining
valuable
knowledge
,
and
experiencing
new
stuff
but
we
ca
n’t
do
it
because
of
this
situation

Hello
Lindy
,
I
wanted
to
know
If
we
have
to
include
the
question
we
thought
of
for
our
bibliography
and
if
we
have
to
include
the
lecture
topic
we
chose
as
well
.
Hello
Gabey
,
unfortunately
I
am
unable
to
attend
todays
tutorial
because
I
am
unwell
.
I
have
completed
the
worksheet
on
system
from
week
5
and
have
attached
it
.
Hello
,
would
you
be
able
to
check
my
bibliography
and
reply
back
with
feedback
because
I
am
unsure
on
whether
I
have
met
the
standards
.
Thank
you
.
Hello
,
for
the
essay
do
we
need
to
chose
a
topic
from
a
lecture
or
the
topic
from
our
group
presentations
?
Hello
,
please
can
you
send
out
the
lecture
slides
from
yesterday
’s
lecture
on
the
critical
review
.
Thank
you
.
Hey
this
picture
is
relevant
to
my
part
of
you
want
to
add
it

Thank
you
,
that
makes
a

more
sense
and
clears
up
my
confusion
!
Hello
,
thank
you
for
sharing
that
article
,
it
was
very
helpful
.
Just
to
clarify
,
because
the
bibliography
wo
n’t
be
included
in
the
word
count
,
does
this
mean
we
should
not
include
one
at
all
?
As
in
a
standard
exam
bibliographies
would
not
be
included
.
Hello
,
I
just
had
a
couple
of
questions
about
the
exam
regarding
the
advice
on
the
presentation
you
made
about
not
needing
to
reference
.
In
order
to
show
use
of
critical
thinking
would
our
paraphrasing
of
literature
and
resources
need
to
include
any
information
about
where
we
got
it
from
,
not
including
the
author
or
title
of
text
?
And
is
their
a
limit
as
to
how
many
Scholars
,
literature
or
resources
would
need
to
be
mentioned
for
the
600
word
limit
?
Hello
,
do
you
know
when
and
where
the
reading
lists
for
the
2nd
year
compulsory
modules
will
be
available
to
access
?
Specifically
for
subject
.
Hello
,
do
you
know
when
we
’ll
be
able
to
view
our
end
of
year
grade
for
first
year
?
Hello
,
I
am
currently
an
university
student
going
in
to
second
year
,
and
I
am
eager
to
start
finding
the
right
placement
for
me
.
I
am
studying
course
,
and
would
prefer
to
complete
a
placement
in
the
subject
field
.
I
have
thought
about
it
being
in
the
area
of
Government
,
for
example
anything
in
the
civil
service
.
However
,
it
is
most
likely
that
a
civil
service
opportunity
would
be
in
Philadelphia
and
due
to
high
living
and
travel
costs
,
I
’d
rather
stay
closer
to
home
.
I
have
heard
about
democratic
placements
and
wondered
if
I
could
have
more
information
on
this
.
I
have
also
looked
at
charities
and
non-
profit
organizations
but
like
most
students
,
would
find
a
paid
placement
more
ideal
.
I
was
wondering
,
what
paid
placement
opportunities
have
past
subject
students
found
?
Another
point
is
that
anything
in
journalism
,
or
broadcasting
,
that
would
suit
the
subject
part
of
degree
is
something
I
would
consider
.
For
example
,
an
opportunity
in
the
BBC
,
as
they
have
an
location
in
Seattle
.
I
am
also
considering
doing
a
half
work
placement
,
half
studying
abroad
,
but
only
in
Europe
.
However
,
would
like
more
information
on
how
this
would
work
.
Specifically
,
for
me
and
my
degree
,
if
I
wanted
to
attend
a
partner
university
of
university
,
what
course
would
I
have
to
pursue
?
,
how
would
this
work
alongside
my
current
degree
?
Overall
,
I
am
searching
for
a
local
work
placement
easy
for
me
to
commute
to
,
or
a
UK
work
placement
where
living
expenses
are
not
too
high
.
I
defiantly
want
a
paid
opportunity
,
and
in
an
area
of
subject
.
However
,
as
previously
mentioned
I
am
open
to
an
opportunity
providing
a
background
of
subject
,
and
a
part
time
studying
abroad
opportunity
.
Please
can
you
get
back
to
me
soon
,
as
I
am
starting
to
worry
about
my
options
,
and
the
current
time
frame
of
not
being
on
campus
has
made
me
feel
anxious
that
I
will
not
find
the
right
opportunity
for
me
.
Thank
you
.
Hello
I
’m
very
confused
as
to
what
this
means
because
I
already
did
my
1
exam
for
this
module
which
was
in
the
takeaway
style
,
and
received
a
grade
and
have
also
received
my
final
year
overall
grade
.
I
did
not
know
about
any
other
exam
and
am
no
where
near
prepared
.
Is
this
a
mistake
?
Hello

do
you

Hello
,
I
’m
looking
to
book
an
in
person
appointment
with

Do

when
your
team
will
be
returning
to
the
campus
?
And
am
I
able
to
pre

book
an

Hello
,
I
was
interested
in
creating
a
new
society
that
I
had
an
idea
for
and
managed
to
get
others
on
board
.
I
have
filled
out
the
new
society
form
,
and
attached
it
here
.
I
believe
now
would
be
a
beneficial
time
to
build
an
online
profile
for
the
society
,
due
to
the
lack
of
on

campus
learning
we
will
probably
receive
for
the
end
of
the
year
.
Please
get
back
to
me
with
your
decision
and
with
any
key
information
I
need
to
know
.
Thanks

Hello
Nadia
,
Unfortunately
due
to
health
issues
and
how
devastated
my
well
-
being
was
in
general
last
term
,
I
felt
I
was
completely
unable
to
produce
a
decent
piece
of
work
for
your
module
,
‘
module
’
.
I
got
into
contact
with
my
personal
tutor
and
he
made
me
aware
of
the
automatic
deferral
,
the
university
has
put
in
place
this
academic
year
,
to
allow
students
to
defer
assessments
till
the
summer
.
I
was
told
to
not
submit
and
no
penalty
would
be
given
,
I
just
will
be
doing
it
in
the
summer
instead
.
I
wanted
to
know
if
you
had
any
specific
information
about
how
the
assessment
for
this
module
will
run
for
the
summer
deferral
?
For
example
,
Will
the
question
be
different
?
Also
,
do
you
know
the
exact
date
of
the
deferral
,
or
when
I
would
be
able
to
find
out
?
Lastly
,
I
really
did
enjoy
this
module
and
your
delivery
of
it
,
it
’s
just
a
shame
that
things
were
not
the
best
for
me
,
and
that
circumstances
meant
we
could
not
meet
on
campus
.
All
the
best
,
.
Hello
Mortimer
,
I
read
the
documents
and
I
am
happy
to
participate
.
I
have
attached
a
link
to
my
signed
consent
form
.
Also
,
it
would
be
great
if
the
date
and
time
of
the
two
sessions
can
be
negotiated
,
so
they
do
not
occur
during
my
live
seminars

Thank
You

I
really
like
films
for
incredible
acting
Like
it
sounds
obvious
,
but
you
know
how
when
it
’s
a
difficult
or
sensible
topic
and
they
just
do
it
really
well
.

Hello
Audrie
,
Apologies
for
the
late
email
.
Our
group
are
fond
of
Multiculturalism
,
as
it
is
relevant
to
us
and
the
society
we
live
in
.
The
study
is
also
quite
broad
,
especially
with
its
criticisms
.
Therefore
,
I
think
it
allows
us
enough
space
to
hone
in
on
the
supportersadvocates
and
its
critiques
like
the
bigger
challenges
from
Nationalists
and
Conservative
ideologies
to
the
certain
liberal
and
socialist
critiques
.
We
want
to
use
scholarly
and
theoretical
views
to
discuss
the
past
and
future
of
the
Ideology
,
with
a
key
theme
of
why
not
only
its
recognition
,
but
also
its
application
in
Politics
is
extremely
prevalent
today
,
considering
the
continuous
examples
of
systematic
discrimination
of
minorities
in
western
societies
,
like
the
George
Floyd
Case
.
Please
could
you
advise
us
on
a
suitable
research
question
,
as
we
have
ideas
but
are
not
yet
certain
on
a
question
?
Thank
You
Hi
Bradly
,
Thanks
for
the
appointment
today
.
I
just
wanted
ask
,
from
your
experience
,
what
are
the
chances
like
of
me
and
my
friend
securing
this
study
abroad
opportunity
for
our
chosen
country_adj
University
?
Considering
they
only
have
2
places
for
university
students
.
Do
you
know
if
anyone
else
has
shown
interest
in
this
University
,
if
not
are
you
able
to
find
out
?
Hi
Gweneth
,
Thanks
for
getting
in
touch
.
I
am
free
this
Saturday
at
2
pm
,
if
that
is
a
good
time
for
you
?
Hi
Marcia
,
Sorry
I
ca
n’t
make
that
time
,
can
we
reschedule
?
Hey
guys
!
I
got
my
pizza
kit
today
but
I
do
n’t
have
the
extra
virgin
olive
oil
,
like
I
’ve
seen
you
usually
provide
with
the
margherita
.
You
have
a
crust
dipping
pesto
instead
.
Shall
I
add
my
own
Olive
oil
,
or
can
is
it
fine
without
?
lways
do
that
Yh
If
not
ask
Annabell
later
he
might
have
cash
I
do
n’t
want
it
Are
you
awake
Oh
yeah
please
can
you
send
any
full
pics
of
the
porridge
I
’ve
made
you
so
I
can
post
them
Nothing
Ioool
I
was
just
thinking
about
buying
a
chair
with
a
back
for
my
desk
instead
of
the
stool
cause
I
have
back
pain
when
I
use
it
,
and
thought
you
might
want
one
for
your
work
But
I
dunno
cause
if
we
move
maybe
there
’s
no
point
Thanks
looooooool
😊

Cheeky
why
did
you
get
me
a
nominal
necklace
😭
😭
😭
You
said
it
was
for
you
ike
when
people
pull
of
weird
characters
to
I
like
donny
Darko
I
’m
not
into
musicals
but
I
appreciate
that
In
school
Noelle
bought
it
in
for
us
to
watch
in
English
and
was
really
passionate
about
it
Never
seen
either
of
them
😬
Are
they
on
a
streaming
platform
Omg
monster
house
!
Ok
Omg
really
?
?
?
I
swear
when
I
bring
it
up
to
people
they
’ve
got
no
idea
I
always
thought
me
and
my
bros
were
the
only
ones
who
watched
it
😂
Get

Now
that
’s
a
film
I
have
n’t
seen
in
ages
So
scary
for
us
children
reviously
emailed
regarding
my
long
awaited
order
.
I
received
a
kind
response
and
shortly
after
one
of
the
two
items
I
had
purchased
arrived
.
As
they
were
not
too
big
at
all
,
and
could
have
both
fit
n
one
box
,
I
was
confused
as
to
why
I
did
not
also
receive
it
.
Please
could
you
find
out
where
the
other
item
is
,
it
is
a
red
Lego
lunchbox
.
My
order
number
is
7446
Thank
You
.
Hey
,
Yes
I
’m
happy
to
start
tomorrow
too
.
If
possible
could
you
guys
check
out
the
email
I
forwarded
of
Andreas
’s
response
to
our
ideas
on
multiculturalism
,
beforehand
,
because
once
we
’ve
finalised
a
questiontopic
title
,
we
can
discuss
a
structure
and
hopefully
get
started
on
writing
our
parts
.
Thanks
.
Hey
Harlie
,
That
’s
awful
your
phone
got
robbed
.
I
hope
you
’re
ok
!
About
the
group
work
,
we
have
n’t
said
anything
and
not
made
a
start
😬
However
,
did
you
see
Crystal
’s
email
reminding
us
of
the
assessment
?
Well
he
said
we
do
get
the
5
day
leeway
,
which
is
probably
good
for
us
considering
we
have
n’t
started
.
Anyway
,
remember
a
while
ago
when
I
said
I
emailed
Harry
our
ideas
on
multiculturalism
,
I
then
forwarded
you
all
his
response
and
so
if
we
take
that
and
come
to
a
structured
plan
of
what
each
of
us
can
write
about
,
then
I
guess
we
can
all
get
going
with
our
1000
words
.
Obviously
I
’ll
tell
the
others
too
look
at
this
response
too
,
because
it
’s
our
starting
point
.
If
you
do
n’t
have
it
,
I
can
forward
it
again
.
Let
me
know
.
Also
I
apologise
for
the
lack
of
communication
and
not
even
starting
it
yet
,
it
’s
kind
of
a
shit
time
for
me
right
now
so
it
’s
just
stupidly
been
pushed
to
the
back
of
my
mind
,
but
ultimately
this
is
a
group
project
and
it
’s
completely
not
fair
on
everyone
else
.
Hey
,
yes
that
sounds
good
to
me
.
Hello
Aurora
,
Unfortunately
due
to
health
issues
and
how
devastated
my
well
-
being
was
in
general
last
term
,
I
felt
I
was
completely
unable
to
produce
a
decent
piece
of
work
for
this
module
.
I
got
into
contact
with
my
personal
tutor
and
he
made
me
aware
of
the
automatic
deferral
,
the
university
has
put
in
place
this
academic
year
,
to
allow
students
to
defer
assessments
till
the
summer
.
I
was
told
to
not
submit
and
no
penalty
would
be
given
,
I
just
will
be
doing
it
in
the
summer
instead
.
I
wanted
to
know
if
you
had
any
specific
information
about
how
the
assessment
for
this
module
will
run
for
the
summer
deferral
?
For
example
,
Will
the
question
be
different
?
Will
it
still
be
a
the
same
type
of
assessment
?
Also
,
do
you
know
the
exact
date
of
the
deferral
,
or
when
I
would
be
able
to
find
out
?
Lastly
,
I
really
did
enjoy
this
module
and
your
delivery
of
it
,
you
seem
like
a
great
linguistic
and
cool
guy
,
it
’s
just
a
shame
that
things
were
not
the
best
for
me
,
and
that
circumstances
meant
we
could
not
meet
on
campus
.
All
the
best
,
.
Hello
I
recently
ordered
a
marghierita
pizza
in
the
post
kit
.
However
,
I
forgot
that
it
includes
Parmesan
which
I
can
not
eat
if
yours
in
not
suitable
for
vegetarians
.
It
’s
supposed
to
be
coming
on
Monday
,
but
is
there
a
way
you
can
adjust
my
box
to
not
include
it
?
I
do
n’t
want
it
to
go
to
waste
!
Hello
!
I
am
.
,
president
of
society
.
Thank
you
so
much
for
finally
getting
our
society
up
on
the
system
.
I
was
wondering
when
will
be
able
to
edit
our
details
on
the
organisation
site
?
In
terms
of
getting
our
logo
up
and
committee
details
and
overall
mantra
?
Right
now
we
can
only
see
the
finances
but
and
nothing
else
.
Please
do
let
us
know
soon
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Mab
,
Thanks
for
your
help
.
I
was
able
to
access
the
admin
tools
and
change
our
logo
,
add
info
etc
.
However
,
I
wanted
to
view
the
number
of
paid
members
but
unfortunately
I
can
not
because
under
admin
tools
all
I
can
see
is
finances
.
Before
I
could
see
them
all
.
Only
our
VP
can
view
it
and
has
access
to
all
the
tools
.
Is
there
any
reason
why
it
’s
like
this
?
Hello
Lara
,
Is
the
basic
reading
for
this
topic

analysis
of
English
:
a
Hallidayan
approach
’
Bloor
,
Thomas
,
the
section
5.4
‘

’
?
As
,
the
task
description
document
says
its
Bloor
and
Bloor
’s
section
on
‘
Cohesive
Ties
’
.
Is
this
the
same
reading
?
As
it
is
the
one
I
have
found
on
the
system
reading
list
.
Hello

Tarzan
Hildegaard

Hi
Orson
,
That
’s

news

much
.
I
will
hopefully
be
coming
to
campus
this
Saturday
4746
November
.
Where
exactly
shall
I
pick
it
up
and
who
will
be
giving
it
to
me
?
Thanks
.
Hello
Marla
,
I
just
had
a
question
about
the
structure
of
newspapers
,
so
I
thought
I
would
ask
you
as
you
seem
to
be
well
informed
on
all
that
stuff
.
What
is
it
called
when
newspapers
,
print
or
online
,
write
first
person
plural
pieces
that
are
titled
,
for
example
,
‘
’
The
Sun
Says
’’
?
I
am
analyzing
one
for
that
is
written
as
a
column
in
a
print
piece
and
want
to
get
the
terminology
correct
.
If
you
know
,
please
let
me
know
,
thanks
!
This
is
the
front
cover
.
Is
this
enough
text
to
analyze
?
If
not
am
I
allowed
to
feature
,
this
column
that
was
printed
in
the
Sun
two
days
after
?
Hello
Manda
,
For
my
analysis
,
I
am
doing
a
front
page
cover
of
a
newspaper
and
using
Fairclough
’s
CDA
approach
.
As
well
as
the
front
cover
,
Is
it
ok
to
use
the
text
of
a
column
from
the
same
newspaper
but
a
from
a
later
date
?
The
column
is
about
the
same
story
the
front
cover
of
my
analysis
is
based
on
.
Also
,
I
feel
like
the
there
is
not
enough
text
to
analysis
just
on
the
front
cover
.
Hello
Jorry
,
I
just
wanted
clarification
on
the
3000
word
module
essay
.
Do
we
literally
begin
the
essay
with
the
outline
we
submitted
earlier
,
or
incorporate
any
parts
of
it
,
considering
we
amend
it
with
your
feedback
?
My
outline
basically
introduced
the
essay
anyway
,
like
explaining
the
structure
and
framework
for
analysis
.
Hello
,
no
worries
.
I
’ve
decided
to
keep
it
now
.
Hello
,
please
can
you
cancel
my
order
.
Hi
,
I
changed
my
mind
about
the
keyboard
I
just
purchased
from
your
site
.
Please
could
you
cancel
it
as
soon
as
possible
,
thanks
.
To
Members
of
Parliament
,
I
am
a
university
student
in
England
,
and
I
am
urging
you
as
our
leaders
to
act
and
speak
on
our
behalf
.
As
a
paying
student
,
I
am
not
receiving
an
education
worth
£
9,250
an
academic
year
and
have
absolutely
no
safety
in
my
degrees
or
future
.
From
the
start
of
the
2020
academic
year
,
we
have
been
limited
to
online
lectures
and
seminars
,
many
of
us
without
a
simple
chance
at
face
-
to
-
face
lessons
in
university
based
on
your
restrictions
.
The
necessity
for
debating
,
critical
thinking
amongst
peers
,
practical
learning
,
access
to
science
labs
and
technology
,
observative
learning
and
several
other
aspects
the
learning
process
a
University
is
supposed
to
give
to
its
students
,
has
been
stripped
from
us
.
This
lack
of
access
to
lectures
and
university
resources
is
all
under
the
order
of
your
restrictions
.
With
all
of
this
deprived
of
us
,
we
are
still
expected
to
completeproduce
the
same
amount
of
work
,
uphold
attendance
,
be
graded
,
and
take
exams
in
the
same
way
as
the
previous
2019
students
,
who
had
full
access
to
the
resources
they
were
paying
for
.
A
-level
students
,
along
with
GCSE
students
have
been
addressed
,
given
direction
,
and
reassured
about
their
exams
and
future
.
However
,
it
is
the
university
students
who
are
paying
£
9,250
an
academic
year
to
study
,
who
have
not
even
received
acknowledgement
from
the
Prime
Minister
or
the
Government
regarding
the
next
steps
of
our
education
.
The
government
has
not
even
had
the
decency
to
address
Universities
and
their
students
other
than
to
blame
them
for
the
spreading
of
COVID-19
.
Where
is
the
exam
safety
net
for
University
students
?
Most
importantly
,
how
will
this
significantly
reduced
service
offer
affect
our
degrees
,
our
careers
,
our
access
to
jobs
with
grades
and
the
job
market
reflective
of
a
global
pandemic
.
Many
students
have
paid
a
minimum
of
£
7000
to
live
in
student
accommodation
to
be
able
to
access
their
university
campus
at
ease
.
Nevertheless
,
the
government
has
restricted
us
from
accessing
the
same
universities
we
have
been
enrolled
to
learn
in
.
On
top
of
this
,
the
government
has
urged
university
students
to
stay
in
our
accommodations
during
this
pandemic
in
an
attempt
to
lower
the
spread
of
the
virus
,
all
while
allowing
millions
of
primary
and
secondary
school
children
to
attend
closed
spaces
of
their
school
facilities
to
demonstrate
your
support
of
education
in
the
UK
.
Are
university
students
not
in
need
of
education
also
?
Although
many
of
us
are
loaning
student
fees
from
the
government
,
we
will
be
expected
to
carry
and
repay
this
debt
for
many
years
.
We
are
asking
you
to
speak
and
act
on
behalf
of
University
students
across
the
UK
.
We
are
pleading
for
a
review
,
reduced
fees
,
and
security
of
our
degrees
.
Many
of
us
who
deferred
our
university
place
for
2019
had
almost
no
choice
but
to
join
university
this
year
,
2020
.
Many
of
us
are
experiencing
isolation
and
a
rapid
decline
in
mental
health
and
emotional
wellbeing
due
to
this
uncertainty
,
lack
of
acknowledgement
and
the
expectation
that
we
should
just
adapt
without
the
expectation
of
support
.
As
a
democratic
country
,
we
empower
you
as
citizens
and
legal
voters
to
speak
and
act
on
our
behalf
.
Please
call
for
a
review
of
our
academic
year
due
to
the
202021
pandemic
.
We
are
the
future
MP
’s
,
nurses
,
doctors
,
vets
,
lawyers
etc
of
the
United
Kingdom
.

Dear
whom
it
may
concern
,
Attached
to
this
email
is
the
Exceptional
Circumstances
Form
.
Specifically
for
the
'
module
'
and
I
know
before
I
can
complete
I
must
ask
for
approval
and
submit
a
form
.
But
I
just
had
a
question
.
So
I
have
a
Whatsapp
group
chat
with
four
other
friends
and
I
was
going
to
ask
them
about
a
movie
and
then
analyse
their
responses
.
For
the
consent
form
do
I
need
to
ask
all
four
of
the
friends
to
sign
the
form
?
Or
do
I
just
make
them
aware
of
the
study
and
email
them
the
ethics
and
participant
info
and
just
sign
the
participant
form
myself
.
I
was
just
confused
about
who
signs
the
form
.
Thank
You
.

Dear
Dr
Melitta
,
I
am
currently
a
student
going
into
my
second
year
and
I
study
course
.
During
the
Covid-19
lockdown
and
the
summer
break
,
unfortunate
personal
events
occurred
.
Currently
,
I
have
a
job
4
days
a
week
and
only
for
4
hours
to
support
myself
financially
.
Unfortunately
,
my
work
timetable
clashes
with
the
online
live
webinar
that
you
hold
on
Tuesdays
between
1
PM
and
2
PM
for
the
module
I
am
a
hard
-
working
student
and
University
is
one
of
the
ways
I
use
to
relax
from
work
and
personal
life
.
I
am
hoping
that
this
term
I
am
okay
to
not
be
present
live
in
these
webinars
.
However
,
I
will
catch
up
on
them
either
after
work
or
the
day
after
and
complete
all
the
notes
and
reading
for
them
.
I
am
in
constant
communication
with
several
students
from
the
class
and
I
assume
a
recording
of
the
webinar
will
be
online
to
look
at
also
.
Therefore
,
I
will
not
be
missing
out
any
of
the
work
or
discussions
to
be
made
.
Also
,
if
you
would
like
to
be
updated
of
my
personal
module
progress
I
will
gladly
be
able
to
always
email
the
work
to
you
not
to
necessarily
check
or
mark
but
just
to
show
that
I
am
not
missing
live
webinars
purposely
.
I
hope
this
is
okay
with
you
.

Dear
Dr
Mace
,
Unfortunately
I
am
not
in
Dallas
until
September
.
As
I
mentioned
before
about
the
personal
circumstances
I
emailed
the
director
of
subject
in
advance
about
my
situation
and
asked
if
it
was
okay
that
I
did
n’t
attend
campus
in
person
and
I
was
given
permission
to
do
so
till
June
.
Are
there
any
other
webinars
available
at
other
times
?
I
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
during
your
break
.
.
Thank
you
Honestly
I
appreciate
it
so
much
.
I
will
keep
you
updated
with
my
notes
so
you
know
I
am
doing
the
work
.
And
hopefully
I
might
be
able
to
work
around
my
shifts
and
attend
the
live
seminars
.
Thank
you
once
again
.

Dear
Madam
,
Here
are
the
details
of
the
itinerary
items
I
have
created
for
your
conference
trip
to
Helsinki
between
the
2nd
and
4th
of
September
2021
.
I
have
found
a
4
-
star
hotel
situated
0.4
miles
away
from
the
city
centre
.
For
two
nights
it
will
cost
£
216
.
It
is
also
situated
close
to
the
Seurasaraselka
waters
so
,
if
we
book
a
room
with
a
view
you
will
always
get
to
see
the
water
.
This
is
£
16
over
budget
but
it
was
the
best
option
in
regards
to
tourist
reviews
and
location
.
Caferino
Obas
is
a
cafe
,
which
is
only
a
ten
-
minute
walk
away
from
the
hotel
and
they
offer
a
great
breakfast
menu
.
They
offer
a
wide
range
of
options
and
alternatives
for
those
who
are
allergic
to
Seafood
.
Helsinki
Museum
is
a
twenty
-
minute
walk
from
the
hotel
but
it
is
specifically
a
museum
popular
with
tourists
for
being
able
to
"
uphold
Helsinki
's
heritage
"
.
Therefore
you
will
learn
a
lot
about
the
city
you
are
visiting
.
Finland
's
national
dish
is
Sauteéd
Reindeer
.
So
I
have
found
a
very
popular
restaurant
called
Restaurant
Lasipalatsi
which
offers
this
dish
.
They
have
a
wide
range
of
sides
to
go
with
this
dish
and
before
booking
the
restaurant
we
are
able
to
call
them
up
beforehand
and
warn
them
about
your
seafood
allergy
.
Therefore
the
food
will
be
catered
for
you
specifically
.
There
is
a
souvenir
shop
called
Mikebon
which
offer
a
wide
range
of
gifts
.
Especially
toys
which
may
be
great
for
your
children
.
Finally
,
for
the
evening
I
have
found
a
Rock
Music
Club
called
Tavastia
.
Since
you
love
live
music
I
have
found
a
club
that
offers
Helsinki
's
popular
genre
and
the
club
itself
is
quite
old
so
this
holds
some
heritage
too
.
I
hope
you
like
the
suggestions
.
If
you
have
any
queries
or
changes
,
please
let
me
know
and
I
will
be
happy
to
look
further
.
Best
Wishes
Dear
Dr.
Alwin
,
I
was
advised
by
my
personal
tutor
to
forward
my
email
to
my
program
director
.
I
understand
that
you
are
the
director
of
undergraduate
programs
.
So
I
hope
you
can
help
me
,
please
.
I
have
also
sent
the
same
email
to
the
subject
and
subject
director
.
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
and
hope
the
Covid-19
situation
has
not
affected
you
too
much
.
Unfortunately
,
Covid-19
has
made
a
big
impact
on
me
and
my
family
.
For
my
well
-
being
,
I
have
had
to
move
to
Seattle
from
my
family
home
in
Los
Angelos
.
I
apologise
in
advance
for
the
lengthy
email
.
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
whether
my
decision
is
okay
.
So
,
what
I
can
understand
from
the
university
updates
via
email
is
that
term
1
will
consist
of
mainly
online
teaching
but
some
on
-
campus
learning
.
I
wanted
to
know
and
confirm
whether
it
would
okay
for
me
to
stay
here
and
continue
with
my
online
learning
here
in
Houston
.
In
regard
to
on
-
campus
learning
,
I
would
make
use
of
the
resources
available
online
and
make
my
tutors
also
aware
.
For
example
,
if
there
are
seminars
I
would
do
the
work
and
reading
notes
electronically
and
then
send
them
to
my
seminar
leaders
and
interact
with
students
I
know
from
that
class
but
online
instead
.
This
way
the
University
does
know
I
am
continuing
with
my
studies
.
Or
if
there
is
any
group
work
,
I
could
communicate
with
group
members
online
via
emailtextSkype
.
And
if
I
had
to
come
onto
campus
to
present
or
any
other
important
reasons
I
could
travel
to
San
Jose
for
a
week
.
There
are
options
for
me
transferring
universities
or
taking
a
year
out
however
for
my
own
self
I
do
love
going
to
university
because
it
is
a
great
way
of
distracting
myself
and
I
love
the
environment
.
Hopefully
,
for
only
a
short
period
things
at
home
in
Seattle
are
not
good
and
I
thought
I
would
stay
in
Pheonix
with
my
relatives
that
live
here
and
they
are
supporting
me
and
keeping
me
distracted
.
At
least
till
December
and
I
may
as
well
use
the
Covid-19
online
teaching
to
its
advantage
.
In
terms
of
adapting
to
the
changes
being
made
at
university
because
of
Covid-19
.
I
believe
I
would
not
face
any
difficulties
when
I
return
because
I
have
been
actively
going
out
in
public
due
to
the
fact
I
am
a
key
worker
at
a
local
business
.
So
,
I
am
fully
aware
and
have
adapted
to
the
new
rules
and
social
distancing
,
etc
.
I
hope
you
can
let
me
know
if
I
am
okay
doing
this
.
And
if
there
are
any
other
tutors
or
university
Staff
that
I
should
make
aware
of
my
decisionsituation
.
Please
feel
free
to
ask
me
any
questions
if
it
will
help
you
understand
the
situation
.
And
if
you
would
like
me
to
clarify
or
explain
how
I
will
still
make
sure
I
keep
up
with
everything
.
Thank
you
.

Dear
Dr.
Korella
,
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
response
.
I
emailed
my
program
directors
and
received
responses
.
Thankfully
teaching
will
be
fully
online
next
term
.
Unfortunately
,
my
grandad
passed
away
because
of
hypothermia
.
He
even
appeared
in
the
publication
!
This
caused
some
stress
in
the
family
because
of
the
sudden
death
but
also
some
problems
between
me
and
my
mum
.
But
my
uncles
have
been
very
supportive
of
me
and
told
me
to
come
to
live
with
them
whilst
things
cool
down
in
Philadelphia
.
I
am
doing
well
now
.
And
I
am
looking
at
getting
a
transfer
with
work
.
So
that
I
have
something
to
do
whilst
I
’m
here
.
San
Antonio
is
a
nice
city
and
the
new
environment
has
been
keeping
me
distracted
.
I
have
been
going
on
walks
every
day
to
the
beach
whilst
I
’m
here
.
I
was
sick
in
November
with
hypothermia
and
missed
one
exam
,
which
I
will
be
sitting
in
August
.
Studying
helps
me
take
my
mind
off
things
so
I
have
no
problem
with
that
.
I
also
managed
to
finish
my
assignments
before
everything
went
downhill
.
So
,
my
studies
have
not
been
affected
.
I
hope
you
are
well
and
not

Dear
Dr.
Lauree
,
I
am
a
first
-
year
student
studying
course
.
I
was
advised
by
my
personal
tutor
to
forward
my
email
to
my
subject
and
subject
directors
.
I
understand
that
you
are
the
head
of
subject
at
university
.
So
,
I
hope
you
can
help
me
or
direct
me
to
the
correct
staff
.
I
have
also
emailed
the
director
of
subject
and
undergraduate
matters
.
I
apologise
in
advance
for
the
lengthy
email
.
I
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
and
hope
the
Covid-19
situation
has
not
affected
you
too
much
.
Unfortunately
,
Covid-19
has
made
a
big
impact
on
me
and
my
family
.
For
my
well
-
being
,
I
have
had
to
move
to
San
Fransisco
from
my
family
home
in
Seattle
.
So
,
what
I
can
understand
from
the
university
updates
via
email
is
that
term
1
mum
just
rang
to
say
if
it
works
out
cheaper
why
do
n’t
you
buy
roast
chicken
and
like
hot
wings
from
Asda
or
Tesco
and
like
coleslaw
et
cetera
Yass
just
to
ask
Jeffrey
but
dw
I
call
Timothea
Yeah
but

it
You

Just

catch
bus
to
town
then
7740
Where
do
you
want
me
to
put
the
clothes
that
were
in
the
dryer
Dear
Dr.
Dannie
,
I
was
advised
by
my
personal
tutor
to
forward
my
email
to
my
subject
and
subject
program
director
.
I
hope
you
can
help
me
,
please
.
I
have
also
emailed
the
director
of
subject
.
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
and
hope
the
Covid-19
situation
has
not
affected
you
too
much
.
Unfortunately
,
Covid-19
has
made
a
big
impact
on
me
and
my
family
.
For
my
well
-
being
,
I
have
had
to
move
to
Seattle
from
my
family
home
in
San
Antonio
.
I
apologise
in
advance
for
the
lengthy
email
.
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
whether
my
decision
is
okay
.
So
,
what
I
can
understand
from
the
university
updates
via
email
is
that
term
1
will
consist
of
mainly
online
teaching
but
some
on
-
campus
learning
.
I
wanted
to
know
and
confirm
whether
it
would
okay
for
me
to
stay
here
and
continue
with
my
online
learning
here
in
Los
Angelos
.
In
regard
to
on
-
campus
learning
,
I
would
make
use
of
the
resources
available
online
and
make
my
tutors
also
aware
.
For
example
,
if
there
are
seminars
I
would
do
the
work
and
reading
notes
electronically
and
then
send
them
to
my
seminar
leaders
and
interact
with
students
I
know
from
that
class
but
online
instead
.
This
way
the
University
does
know
I
am
continuing
with
my
studies
.
Or
if
there
is
any
group
work
,
I
could
communicate
with
group
members
online
via
emailtextSkype
.
And
if
I
had
to
come
onto
campus
to
present
or
any
other
important
reasons
I
could
travel
to
Philadelphia
for
a
week
.
There
are
options
for
me
transferring
universities
or
taking
a
year
out
however
for
myself
I
do
love
going
to
university
because
it
is
a
great
way
of
distracting
myself
and
I
love
the
environment
.
Hopefully
,
for
only
a
short
period
things
at
home
in
Philadelphia
are
not
good
and
I
thought
I
would
stay
in
San
Fransisco
with
my
relatives
that
live
here
and
they
are
supporting
me
and
keeping
me
distracted
.
At
least
till
July
and
I
may
as
well
use
the
Covid-19
online
teaching
to
its
advantage
.
In
terms
of
adapting
to
the
changes
being
made
at
university
because
of
Covid-19
.
I
believe
I
would
not
face
any
difficulties
when
I
return
because
I
have
been
actively
going
out
in
public
due
to
the
fact
I
am
a
key
worker
at
a
local
business
.
So
,
I
am
fully
aware
and
have
adapted
to
the
new
rules
and
social
distancing
,
etc
.
I
hope
you
can
let
me
know
if
I
am
okay
doing
this
.
And
if
there
are
any
other
tutors
or
university
Staff
that
I
should
make
aware
of
my
decisionsituation
.
Please
feel
free
to
ask
me
any
questions
if
it
will
help
you
understand
the
situation
.
And
if
you
would
like
me
to
clarify
or
explain
how
I
will
still
make
sure
I
keep
up
with
everything
.
Thank
you
.

Introduction
The
transformation
from
the
original
labour
party
to
the
New
Labour
party
is
a
significant
period
in
British
political
history
.
It
was
the
introduction
of
a
new
ideology
with
similar
social
democratic
values
as
the
past
but
with
the
advantage
of
taking
account
the
changes
in
the
modern
era
;
economically
and
socially
etc
.
The
following
essay
will
focus
mainly
on
the
transformation
since
the
1990s
with
some
reference
to
the
past
Labour
party
that
originated
before
the
1990s
.
Also
,
the
essay
will
specifically
look
at
the
domestic
policies
rather
than
foreign
policies
.
The
impact
made
can
be
split
into
focusing
on
the
three
main
sectors
;
Health
,
education
and
Law
and
Order
.
The
essay
will
be
discussing
whether
there
has
been
a
major
shift
in
parties
or
whether
it
is
the
same
but
just
holds
a
new
name
.
Further
analysing
the
positive
and
negative
outcome
of
this
development
.
Taking
into
consideration
whether
there
will
be
a
return
of
new
labour
.
What
is
the
‘
Old
’
Labour
party
?
The
beginning
of
the
Labour
party
was
in
the
1900s
.
Due
to
the
fact
New
Labour
promoted
its
modernised
values
,
there
’s
a
possibility
in
the
future
Blairs
Labour
could
be
developed
and
improved
to
meet
the
needs
of
those
who
disapproved
of
the
shift
to
the
centre
.
However
,
New
Labours
'
dramatic
fall
in
history
and
negatives
outcomes
could
discourage
the
public
trust
in
such
a
party
.
Throughout
this
exploration
of
the
transformation
from
'
Old
'
Labour
to
New
Labour
,
you
can
see
clearly
that
there
are
more
differences
than
similarities
.
Blair
tried
to
change
the
face
of
Labour
huge
but
failed
to
make
it
work
.
This
can
be
shown
through
how
the
negative
outcome
heavily
outweighs
the
positives
.
To
conclude
,
the
transformation
did
make
a
big
impact
on
British
history
however
not
a
good
one
.
Blair
worked
very
hard
to
please
the
nation
and
achieve
everything
he
promised
yet
it
was
n't
possible
to
satisfy
everyone
and
also
wrong
decision
led
to
negative
outcomes
that
Labour
will
be
remembered
for
.

Hey
guys
!
I
was
thinking
we
should
start
to
meet
up
every
Friday
on
system
at
11
am
.
The
sessions
should
only
last
for
an
hour
and
if
needed
we
can
go
over
by
30
minutes
.
We
are
group
three
under
the
system
webinar
section
on
the
module
page
.
We
need
to
finalise
our
research
questions
before
the
9490
of
November
so
that
we
can
send
it
to
Dr
Standford
.
So
,
it
will
be
great
if
we
can
discuss
a
topic
on
Saturday
the
7174
and
then
go
off
and
think
of
research
questions
.
Then
on
Sunday
the
6839
we
can
share
our
ideas
and
create
a
document
with
our
research
questions
and
have
it
ready
to
send
by
the
end
of
our
session
.
If
Thursdays
at
11
am
is
not
a
good
time
just
email
me
back
and
then
we
can
change
the
time

Dear
whom
may
it
concern
,
I
am
currently
a
second
-
year
university
student
at
university
.
Unfortunately
,
due
to
family
problems
and
other
personal
circumstances
,
I
am
in
a
situation
where
I
will
be
moving
out
without
the
support
of
my
family
and
I
will
be
on
my
own
.
I
am
currently
in
the
process
of
applying
for
a
maintenance
loan
to
support
me
additionally
.
My
father
died
when
I
was
young
,
so
I
was
only
in
contact
with
my
mother
.
However
,
in
October
8409
my
mother
kicked
me
out
of
the
house
and
culturally
I
have
been
"
disowned
"
by
my
family
.
I
have
been
since
living
temporarily
at

However
,
they
do
not
want
me
to
do
life
with
them
because
of
family
issues
.
I
am
capable
to
move
out
and
I
am
looking
at
student
accommodation
.
I
am
currently
employed
part
-
time
and
will
be
when
I
intend
to
move
into
accommodation
but
the
only
difficulty
I
am
facing
is
;
every
suitable
agency
requires
me
to
provide
a
guarantor
but
this
is
a
problem
because
I
have
no
one
that
will
allow
me
to
put
them
down
as
my
guarantor
.
My
friends
are
not
eligible
,
my
family
are
not
supportive
of
my
choices
and
my
work
colleagues
have
not
known
me
for
long
.
Also
,
I
ca
n't
pay
off
the
whole
rent
in
one
sum
for
the
period
but
my
permanent
job
at
business
and
the
support
from
student
finance
will
allow
me
to
pay
the
rent
every
month
as
the
agencies
require
.
What
advice
or
suggestions
do
you
have
,
please

Dear
Dr
Perry
,
I
hope
you
are
well
and
enjoyed
your
well
deserved
Christmas
Break
.
Unfortunately
,
I
have
been
going
through
quite
a
lot
of
family
issues
which
involved
me
moving
from
house
to
house
and
the
Covid-19
situation
is
not
really
helping
either
.
This
was
happening
through
the
whole
of
last
year
but
,
luckily
the
start
of
2021
has
been
easy
on
me
.
I
was
made
aware
by
another
student
that
unviersity
has
the
No

available
.
I
will
attach

Thank
you
very
much

I
appreciate

and
I
have
managed

my

Thank
you
once
again

Heyy
Hope
you
’re
well
Quick
question
are
you
in
the
module
module
?
.
It
’s
okay
do
n’t
worry
😂
.
Dear
Dr.
Alida
,
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
and
hope
the
Covid-19
situation
has
not
affected
you
too
much
.
Unfortunately
,
Covid-19
has
made
a
big
impact
on
me
and
my
family
.
For
my
well
being
,
I
have
had
to
move
to
Dallas
from
my
home
in
Dallas
.
I
thought
because
you
are
my
personal
tutor
,
it
would
be
best
to
make
you
aware
of
my
situation
.
I
apologise
in
advance
for
the
lengthy
email
.
And
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
whether
my
decision
is
okay
.
So
,
what
I
can
understand
from
the
university
updates
via
email
is
that
term
1
will
consist
of
mainly
online
teaching
but
some
on
-
campus
learning
.
I
wanted
to
know
and
confirm
whether
it
would
okay
for
me
to
stay
here
and
continue
with
my
online
learning
here
in
Pheonix
.
In
regards
to
on
-
campus
learning
,
I
would
make
use
of
the
resources
available
online
and
make
my
tutors
also
aware
.
For
example
,
if
there
are
seminars
I
would
do
the
work
and
reading
notes
electronically
and
then
send
them
to
my
seminar
leaders
.
This
way
the
University
does
know
I
am
continuing
with
my
studies
.
Or
if
there
is
any
group
work
,
I
could
communicate
with
group
members
online
via
emailtextSkype
.
And
if
I
had
to
come
onto
campus
to
present
or
any
other
important
reasons
I
could
travel
to
Los
Angelos
for
a
week
.
Would
it
be
best
to
email
my
department
and
make
them
aware
too
?
There
are
options
of
me
transferring
universities
or
taking
a
year
out
however
for
myself
self
I
love
going
to
university
because
it
is
a
great
way
of
distracting
myself
and
I
love
the
environment
.
However
,
hopefully
,
for
only
a
short
period
things
at
home
in
San
Fransisco
are
not
good
and
I
thought
I
would
stay
in
San
Jose
with
my
family
that
lives
here
and
they
are
supporting
me
and
keeping
me
distracted
.
At
least
till
July
and
I
may
as
well
use
the
Covid-19
online
teaching
to
its
advantage
.
In
terms
of
adapting
to
the
changes
being
made
at
university
because
of
Covid-19
.
I
believe
I
would
not
face
any
difficulties
when
I
return
because
I
have
been
actively
going
out
in
public
due
to
the
fact
I
am
a
key
worker
at
a
local
business
.
So
,
I
am
fully
aware
and
have
adapted
to
the
new
rules
and
social
distancing
,
etc
.
I
hope
you
can
let
me
know
if
I
am
okay
doing
this
.
And
if
there
are
any
other
tutors
or
university
Staff
that
I
should
make
aware
of
my
decisionsituation
.
Please
feel
free
to
ask
me
any
questions
if
it
will
help
understand
the
situation
.
Thank
you
.

Dear

I

I

I

Dear

I

topic

In

Portfolio
Assignment

When
checking
over
my
work
I
realised
I
may
have
made
a
mistake
but
I
wanted
to
just
confirm
with
you
.
The
task
asks
for
"
A
commercial
around
30
seconds
"
.
However
,
I
wrote
about
a
3
-
minute
commercial-
misunderstanding
the
task
as
choosing
a
commercial
which
was
at
least
30
seconds
.
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
whether
there
was
a
restriction
and
whether
I
will
need
to
redo
the
task
?
I
hope

Portfolio
Asssignment
.
It
was
due
on
Monday
the
8910
of
September
at
midday
.
However
I
was
made
well
aware
by
different
university
tutors
that
there
is
a
5
day
‘
Working
day
’
extension
period
.
Not
necessarily
an
extension
but
that
would
n’t
be
penalised
.
As
a
student
who
is
a
a
key
worker
and
looks
after
the
kids
of
key
workers
I
obviously
took
the
advantage
of
looking
over
my
work
and
knowing
that
I
was
given
time
to
prefect
my
work
.
However
now
I
feel
absolutely
stressed
because
the
submission
link
is
no
longer
there
even
though
I
am
still
in
the
window
of
submission
.
Monday
the
5602
of
December
is
a
university
bank
holiday
and
the
weekend
is
not
included
in
the
working
days
.
Therefore
the
‘
extended
deadline
’
is
Thursday
949
of
December
at
Midday
.
I
understand
this
is
n’t
the
appropriate
time
to
be
emailing
but
I
have
always
submitted
my
assignment
in
the
early
hours
of
the
day
6
hours
before
the
deadline
to
take
full
opportunity
of
the
time
given
and
I
have
never
had
a
problem
.However
the
fact
the
turn
it
in
link
is
not
there
was
brought
to
my
attention
by
another
student
.
It
has
caused
me
to
worry
this
early
in
the
morning
.
Many
modules
have
similarly
had
turn
it
in
links
open
still
after
the
5
day
period
and
students
have
all
used
this
opportunity
so
I
feel
very
dis
-
advantaged
.
I
am
unsure
what
to
do
now
so
incase
I
do
n't
receive
a
response
by
9
am
I
will
the
just
incase
email
my
assignment
to
this
email
to
show
I
have
done
it
but
the
link
was
not
available
.
I
hope
you
can
please
help
me
with
this
.
Thank

After
this
you

do
n’t
need
to
worry
because
I
will
submit
our

for

And
send
you
a
copy
of
the

it
in

.
Also
a
reminder
-
we
need
to
each

which
can
be
found

.
That
we
must

Dear
Dr
Sloan

I

Unfortunately
,
Benji
has
still
not
been
in
contact
with
us
,
even
after
you
spoke
to
them
in
September
.
We
have
continuously
included
the

in
all
correspondence
,
and
we
have
invited
them
to
all
meetings
.
However
,
we
have
not
received
any
responses
yet
.
Regarding
the
final
assignment
-
We
have
sent
Vassili
the
notes
and
the
structure
of
our
assignment
.
I
have
also
sent
an
email
out
saying
that
because
of
the
deadline
extension
I
will
hope
to
receive
everyone
’s
assignments
by
Monday
,
the
2063
of
December
so
,
that
I
can
compile
the
assignments
together
and
submit
it
.
We
thought
it
would
be
best
to
make
you
aware
of
the
situation
.
Especially
if
you
are
confused
to
why
our
assignment
will
only
be
compiled
of
three
essays
instead
of
four
.
Also
,
if
we
do
not
receive
anything
from
the
student
should
we
conclude
our
assignment
without
their
input
or
just
leave
a
gap
at
the
end
.
According
to
our
structure
,
her
input
would
have
been
the
final
assignment
and
conclusion
.
Thank
you

I
always

sleeping

And
my

nearly
over

dark

Oh

3
pm

I
just

saying
they
will
call
mid

so
I
can
still
get
a
little
rest
And
they
asked
me
to
send
pictures
of
my
foot

I
just
had
to

Rationale
:
The
research
topic
I
am
looking
at
links
to
the
use
of
social
media
and
what
the
possible
consequences
are
,
I
chose
to
study
this
topic
due
to
the
wide
use
of
social
media
and
how
much
it
has
taken
over
what
we
do
and
how
we
live
our
lives
.
Social
media
is
used
in
many
ways
such
as
for
business
purposes
,
marketing
,
cultural
exchanges
,
news
sources
,
etc
.
Most
people
in
today
’s
society
have
access
to
at
least
a
minimum
of
one
social
media
platform
due
to
the
increased
popularity
in
social
networking
,
especially
in
the
younger
generation
,
but
my
research
aims
to
look
at
how
this
may
affect
an
individual
.
According
to
a
survey
conducted
in
2018
by
common
sense
media
,
40
%
of
teenagers
aged
between
13
-
17
claimed
that
keeping
in
contact
with
friends
on
social
media
daily
is
either
"
extremely
"
or
"
very
"
important
.
The
main
research
question
I
am
looking
at
is
what
is
the
impact
of
social
media
on
an
individual
’s
self
-
perception
and
relationship
?
This
will
be
done
by
conducting
a
semi
-
structured
interview
,
with
the
interview
schedule
being
in
the
appendices
,
showing
the
development
built
from
the
main
question
.
This
includes
the
effects
of
social
media
for
friendships
relationships
and
families
,
how
mental
health
can
be
damaged
and
looking
at
whether
social
media
is
seen
as
healthy
or
not
.
The
method
of
analysis
I
have
chosen
for
this
research
topic
is
discourse
analysis
,
this
is
the
most
appropriate
method
,
for
the
study
I
am
conducting
,
as
I
am
investigating
the
perception
of
social
media
and
getting
a
better
understanding
at
the
individual
’s
views
of
social
media
rather
than
their
life
experiences
.
The
name
of
the
participant
I
interviewed
will
not
be
used
to
protect
confidentiality
,
so
I
used
the
pseudonym
Eliza
.
Results
:
Discourse
1-
negativity
of
social
media
Eliza
understands
how
much
social
media
is
used
and
how
it
does
cause
problems
despite
her
lack
of
use
of
social
media
"
I
rarely
use
social
media
"
.
Eliza
portrays
the
discursive
object
as
social
media
and
the
discourse
of
social
media
being
negative
.
Eliza
knows
that
social
media
is
constantly
being
used
and
that
people
on
social
media
may
behave
inappropriately
leading
to
serious
consequences
.
She
understands
the
effects
it
can
have
on
a
person
and
the
reason
why
people
may
behave
this
way
.
Eliza
realises
that
on
social
media
people
can
act
in
a
way
that
is
not
the
same
as
how
they
behave
in
real
life
,
but
their
actions
can
ultimately
hurt
the
people
they
love
.
She
explores
that
people
use
social
media
in
the
wrong
way
knowing
that
what
they
are
doing
is
wrong
however
some
people
also
get
treated
bad
on
social
media
for
no
reason
and
this
can
affect
an
individual
due
to
increase
of
negativity
.
Eliza
points
out
that
not
only
does
negativity
affect
communication
between
people
but
also
interferes
with
how
an
individual
feels
about
themselves
,
particularly
through
cyber
-
bullying
which
can
destroy
how
someone
might
feel
about
themselves
and
make
them
feel
low
,
therefore
affecting
how
they
behave
.
Discourse
2-
vital
for
families
Eliza
does
share
the
good
things
of
social
media
being
that
it
helps
keep
people
in
connection
with
each
other
,
mainly
with
families
.
Despite
the
risk
of
suffering
bullying
or
negativity
,
some
people
may
just
use
social
media
just
as
a
form
of
contact
to
those
they
can
not
get
a
reach
of
often
or
see
in
person
.
Eliza
explains
how
social
media
is
very
beneficial
to
socialise
for
the
right
reasons
to
the
right
people
,
this
is
a
common
reason
for
Eliza
using
social
media
herself
,
to
be
able
to
interact
with
family
and
keep
a
strong
bond
from
members
of
her
family
she
might
not
see
very
often
.
This
shows
that
although
social
media
might
not
be
a
safe
place
,
it
does
have
positives
for
bringing
people
together
and
can
in
some
ways
create
a
stronger
community
amongst
people
.
Eliza
then
goes
on
to
discuss
how
social
media
can
be
a
disadvantage
with
family
members
who
might
not
allow
freedom
whilst
on
social
media
and
watch
over
what
they
are
doing
,
causing
dispute
between
people
.
This
is
obviously
seen
as
a
disadvantage
as
people
in
the
younger
generation
especially
do
not
want
to
be
supervised
on
what
they
do
and
who
they
talk
to
by
relatives
however
,
in
other
ways
this
can
be
seen
as
a
good
thing
as
by
having
family
members
on
social
media
,
this
should
stop
people
from
posting
something
that
may
be
inappropriate
or
offensive
as
parents
can
watch
what
their
children
are
doing
online
.
Eliza
then
goes
on
to
talk
about
reputation
and
states
"
oh
,
wait
and
also
you
might
post
things
that
goes
against
families
"
,
this
can
vary
between
posting
something
that
can
go
against
religion
,
can
be
a
hateful
comment
such
as
homophobia
or
a
revealing
picture
that
parents
would
not
want
other
people
seeing
.
This
would
therefore
cause
strains
and
arguments
between
family
members
as
parents
may
try
and
be
controlling
but
children
may
want
some
space
for
themselves
.
Discourse
3-
loneliness
Eliza
shared
her
thoughts
on
whether
people
who
use
social
media
tend
to
be
lonely
or
not
.
She
explained
that
is
it
common
for
people
to
use
social
media
for
company
and
may
even
talk
to
someone
that
they
have
not
met
before
in
real
life
.
She
claims
that
people
do
talk
to
people
on
social
media
due
to
lack
in
confidence
in
making
friends
which
is
becoming
a
problem
for
children
as
they
might
start
to
rely
on
talking
to
people
online
and
causing
them
to
lack
the
right
skills
to
communicate
with
people
in
real
life
.
She
also
mentions
that
people
do
it
to
make
themselves
feel
better
and
more
appreciated
by
having
someone
talk
to
them
in
a
friendly
manner
.
This
goes
against
the
points
of
being
cyber
-
bullied
showing
that
some
people
who
might
get
bullied
in
real
life
rely
on
people
on
the
internet
to
keep
then
happy
.
Eliza
did
suggest
that
not
everyone
uses
social
media
due
to
feeling
lonely
but
might
use
it
because
they
could
potentially
be
bored
or
still
require
more
attention
and
people
to
talk
to
.
Some
people
do
have
enough
friends
and
families
in
their
lives
to
talk
to
often
but
might
get
bored
and
want
to
use
social
media
rather
than
actually
feeling
lonely
.
Discourse
4-
social
media
not
healthy
Eliza
justified
that
social
media
can
be
healthy
in
some
ways
but
may
also
be
unhealthy
and
gave
her
views
for
both
sides
leading
a
balanced
answer
.
She
claimed
that
a
lot
of
people
use
social
media
just
for
attention
and
to
get
people
to
start
to
notice
them
more
which
also
makes
them
feel
better
and
improve
their
self
-
esteem
but
in
the
wrong
ways
Eliza
goes
on
to
contradict
herself
by
then
saying
it
is
healthy
as
individuals
could
use
social
media
to
seek
help
and
people
will
reply
to
them
in
a
way
that
makes
them
feel
better
.
Some
people
find
it
easier
to
talk
on
social
media
and
if
that
is
their
way
of
making
themselves
happier
than
it
is
being
used
in
a
healthy
manner
.
Eliza
basically
claims
that
it
is
the
mindset
we
have
for
using
social
media
,
some
people
use
it
to
be
needy
and
have
people
feel
sorry
for
them
and
that
is
not
a
healthy
way
of
using
social
media
however
Eliza
thinks
that
letting
out
your
problems
is
healthy
when
people
do
it
to
genuinely
speak
their
mind
and
helps
them
to
feel
relieved
.
Discussion
:
Eliza
showed
moments
throughout
the
interview
where
she
is
against
the
use
of
social
media
and
does
not
agree
with
how
it
is
being
used
these
days
however
,
she
also
realises
the
importance
of
it
.
Through
experience
she
realised
that
talking
to
family
through
social
media
is
a
great
phenomenon
which
makes
her
feel
content
,
she
also
brought
on
the
fact
that
people
who
may
need
more
support
use
social
media
widely
to
gain
that
support
so
can
make
people
feel
better
.
A
study
done
in
2003
by
Janet
Morahan
-
Martin
shows
that
individuals
that
are
lonelier
tend
to
use
social
media
more
for
companionship
and
intimacy
especially
compared
to
those
who
are
not
so
much
lonely
.
Eliza
shows
the
different
people
on
social
media
who
can
either
improve
the
well
-
being
of
an
individual
or
make
it
worse
depending
on
the
type
of
person
who
uses
social
media
.
Some
people
care
about
individuals
and
do
feel
sincere
about
those
who
are
troubled
,
and
then
some
people
feel
joy
about
intimidating
others
through
social
media
and
have
no
guilt
to
tear
apart
friendships
or
relationships
making
social
media
an
unsafe
place
.
With
the
final
discourse
about
whether
social
media
is
healthy
or
not
,
Eliza
managed
to
show
both
points
of
views
on
whether
it
is
accepted
and
beneficial
or
whether
there
are
consequences
,
she
stated
it
should
only
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
seeking
help
from
anyone
online
and
to
relieve
whatever
pain
,
sadness
or
emotion
they
are
feeling
.
The
wrong
way
to
do
it
is
by
lying
or
exaggerating
on
social
media
just
to
acquire
a
specific
response
or
reaction
from
the
people
reading
it
.
Dear
sir
or
madam
,
I
have
been
trying
to
find
placements
to
do
in
Pheonix
,
as
that
is
where
I
live
,
which
are
course
related
.
Most
of
the
places
I
have
contacted
either
by
phone
call
or
email
have
gotten
back
to
me
but
claim
they
are
not
taking
placement
students
due
to
Covid
.
I
am
really
struggling
to
find
a
placement
and
would
be
grateful
if
you
can
help
me
get
a
placement
in
Seattle
.
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Gayleen
,
If
I
am
being
honest
,
I
would
not
mind
any
role
which
are
course
related
and
preferably
one
which
pays
.
I
've
looked
into
some
business_descr
and
quite
a
lot
of
primary
schools
but
at
this
rate
I
'll
be
happy
with
any
sort
of
placement
which
enables
me
to
help
others
.
I
am
not
keen
on
working
in
a
secondary
school
though
.
And
I
would
like
to
do
a
placement
in
Seattle
only
because
I
will
be
living
at
home
,
as
I
do
n't
have
a
car
,
yet
I
do
not
want
to
be
commuting
to
a
different
area
and
due
to
Covid
,
me
and
my
family
are
not
fond
of
taking
public
transport
.
I
also
do
n't
want
to
move
to
a
different
city
,
especially
if
placement
ends
up
being
online
,
so
I
much
rather
stay
at
home
.
Thanks
,
..
Hi
Audy
,
No
worries

I

free
Tuesday
at
13:00pm

if
not
then
I
'll
be
happy
to
take
the
next
available
slot
that
you
have
.
Hi
Tammy
,
Sunday
at
11:20

be
great

,
thanks

Look

to

Hi

Dear
sir
or
madam
,
I
am
a
second
year
university
student
currently
studying
course
at
university
,
Chicago
.
I
wish
to
do
a
placement
and
was
wondering
if
your
facility
takes
on
placement
students
.
It
would
be
a
great
opportunity
to
work
with
monkey
pox
patients
as
I
would
be
able
to
learn
a
lot
and
I
am
very
fond
of
helping
others
.
My
placement
will
need
to
be
a
minimum
20
weeks
starting
anytime
from
September
2478
and
must
be
completed
by
September
5440
.
Below
is
a
handbook
which
will
provide
extra
information
and
I
will
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
you
may
have
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.
Thank
,

I
am
aware

Hi
Finley
I
was
late
to
sign
up
to

programme
but
talked
to
Martie
and
she
did
not
mind
me
joining
as
long
as
task
1
has
not
been
completed
.
She
has
allocated
me
into
your
group
and
told
me
to
ask
a
member
whether
task
1
has
already
been
completed
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
you
could
get
back
to
me
to
let
me
know
if
your
group
has
finished
task
1
yet
.
Thanks

Hi
Fairfax
I
apologise
for
missing
the
interview
.
I
had
been
trying
to
access
the
email
to
join
the
zoom
call
however
the
internet
in
my
accommodation
was
not
working
.
If
you
could
give
me
another
chance
to
reschedule
the
interview
that
would
be
great
however
I
do
understand
that
10:30
was
your
free
time
and
that
I
may
have
missed
my
chance
.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
and
I
do

Dear
CEO
,
Following
the
task
you
have
given
me
,
I
have
arranged
your
itinerary
for
your
trip
to
Helsinki
.
I
have
booked
for
you
to
stay
at
Radisson
Blu
Seaside
Hotel
Helsinki
as
it
has
a
great
view
of
the
seaside
in
front
and
is
within
your
budget
.
For
the
2
nights
you
requested
it
will
cost
Â£180
and
includes
breakfast
if
you
choose
to
stay
in
.
Close
to
the
hotel
is
a
cafe
called
Moko
Market
cafe
and
store
Punavuori
which
will
give
you
a
great
variety
of
breakfast
options
and
also
happens
to
be
closest
to
the
seaside
so
you
can
enjoy
a
great
view
while
having
breakfast
.
This
will
roughly
be
a
4
minute
drive
from
the
hotel
.
7
Minutes
away
from
the
hotel
is
an
interesting
museum
called
Paivalehti
newspaper
museum
which
had
great
reviews
and
will
teach
you
a
lot
about
Helsinki
.
Close
to
the
hotel
is
a
restaurant
called
Mekong
Ravintola
which
is
a
3
minute
drive
from
the
hotel
,
serves
great
food
and
is
highly
rated
.
The
restaurant
has
a
variety
of
foods
so
you
will
not
have
to
worry
about
having
issues
with
seafood
.
A
great
gift
shop
which
is
nearby
is
shop
Helsinki
Mikebon
which
is
a
souvenir
shop
that
will
have
many
items
to
choose
from
for
your
children
.
And
lastly
as
you
requested
for
a
night
out
to
enjoy
,
there
is
a
great
entertainment
place
called
Storyville
which
is
a
jazz
club
.
This
place
also
serves
meals
and
has
a
terrace
area
to
enjoy
the
night
life
.
This
is
approximately
7
minutes
away
from
the
hotel
by
car
.
Hopefully
that
is
everything
you
are
looking
for
and
you
enjoy
your

Dear
Sir
or
Madam
I
have
had
a
lot
of
problems
trying
to
find
placements
for
December
due
to
Covid
and
not
a
lot
of
people
offering
placements
at
the
moment
.
One
facility
has
just
got
back
to
me
,
but
they
have
a
few
enquiries
before
they
can
offer
me
a
placement
.
As
it
is
a
business_descr
they
have
asked
if
university
is
providing
me
with
a
DBS
check
and
how
many
weeks
of
placement
is
required
.
If
you
can
get
back
to
me
confirming
the
answers
,
that
would
be
very
helpful
.
Yours
Faithfully
.
Hi
Idette
I
just
completed
the
exam
and
received
a
total
of
33
out
of
65
points
.
I
am
quite
disappointed
considering
how
much
I
revised
and
how
confident
I
was
while
doing
my
exam
.
I
did
not
expect
it
to
be
that
low
.
Is
there
any
way
the
answers
can
be
looked
over
as
I
would
like
to
make
sure
the
marking
was
correctly
done
especially
as
some
answers
seemed
to
be
incorrectly
ordered
,
as
shown
by
the
attachments
.
I
apologise
for
the
hassle
,
but
I
would
very
much
appreciate
the
help
.
Thanks

Dear

I

I

Although
I

I

relaxed

Hiya
I
can
hear
you
completely
whom
it
may
concern
With
the
maintenance
that
will
be
taking
place
will
it
be
stopped
during
the
exam
period
because
I
and
many
other
students
will
not
be
satisfied
with
construction
taking
place
while
we
should
be
studying
or
doing
an
exam
in
our
rooms
especially
since
we
have
no
other
place
to
go
to
.
I
would
not
have
had
a
problem
any
other
point
in
the
year
but
doing
construction
during
exam
periods
is
very
inconsiderate
to
students
who
want
little
distraction
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Rolph
,
Thank
you
for
sending
me
a
link
,
I
was
more
looking
for
things
I
can
just
volunteer
in
especially
if
you
have
any
events
or
activities
in
the
upcoming
week
.
If
you
could
let
me
know
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
Regards
,
..
I
have
been
trying
to
find
activities
and
events
on
the
organisation
page
for
task
4
,
but
I
can
not
seem
to
find
anything
,
I
've
also
emailed
organisation
and
they
sent
me
a
link
to
some
activities
,
but
it
was
not
really
helpful
as
shown
by
the
picture
below
,
and
I
do
n't
know
where
I
can
find
an
event
to
volunteer
in
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
help
me
to
find
something
or
let
me
know
what
upcoming
events
there
are
,
which
I
can
take
part
in
.
Thanks

Hi
,
I
will
respectfully
prefer
you
talking
with
the
team
and
discussing
better
starting
times
to
start
the
construction
.
Due
to
the
situation
we
are
in
,
I
do
n’t
feel
comfortable
having
to
move
and
study
elsewhere
.
It
will
also
be
inconvenient
to
have
to
move
my
things
out
within
the
last
few
months
I
have
which
happens
to
be
my
exam
season
.
So
it
would
be
much
appreciated
if
the
construction
can
be
delayed
just
during
exams
especially
since
me
and
the
other
people
living
at
building
feel
the
same
way
.
I
understand
aswell
that
these
changes
that
are
being
made
are
essential
however
in
the
first
email
it
says
it
is
not
mandatory
so
that
gives
me
the
impression
that
it
does
not
need
to
be
done
immediately
,
disrupting
my
education
along
with
others
.
Thanks
,

Abstract
:
This
experiment
investigates
the
alpha
inhibition
hypothesis
shows
that
participants
do
not
perform
as
well
when
distracted
and
are
more
likely
to
make
common
mistakes
when
taking
part
in
a
task
.
To
gain
more
accurate
results
these
limitations
will
need
to
be
controlled
such
as
being
in
an
environment
with
minimal
noises
,
therefore
helping
the
participant
to
focus
better
.

I

evidence

uploaded
more
than
1

I

that
is
ok

Hi
Lorne
,
I
was
hoping
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
as
I
am
being
really
thick
,
and
this
assignment
is
confusing
me
a
lot
.
I
have
started
it
however
every
time
I
try
and
do
it
,
I
feel
like
I
am
taking
2
steps
backwards
and
getting
lost
again
,
even
after
watching
all
the
lectures
again
.
I
think
the
main
problem
is
that
because
I
have
n't
collected
the
data
,
I
have
no
idea
what
to
write
for
certain
things
.
What
should
I
be
writing
for
a
hypothesis
what
I
am
predicting
?
I
understand
I
am
doing
a
correlation
analysis
to
find
topic
and
I
am
doing
a
regression
analysis
to
see
if
topic
.
So
,
am
I
therefore
just
looking
at
ONE
of
the
personality
traits
that
you
have
taught
us
and
saying
how
topic
?
e.g.
if
I
say
that
people
who
are
happy
are
more
likely
to
have
an
unhealthy
hypothermia
.
Then
I
will
back
up
my
hypothesis
with
previous
research
?
Another
thing
I
am
not
sure
about
is
how
much
detail
to
add
,
maybe
I
am
overthinking
it
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
miss
information
based
on
what
I
have
done
in
previous
modules
.
For
example
,
when
talking
about
participants
,
on
the
excel
spreadsheet
you
have
provided
,
I
am
aware
there
are
195
participants
,
135
of
them
are
female
and
60
of
them
are
male
and
they
are
aged
between
17
-
73
.
However
,
I
am
not
aware
of
how
these
participants
were
gathered
sample
.
Would
I
need
to
state
that
they
volunteered
?
For
the
design
of
the
study
would
it
be
correlational
?
And
also
,
I
am
not
exactly
sure
what
you
mean
by
predicter
variables
?
I
am
sorry
for
asking
many
questions
,
but
I
would
appreciate
the
help
.
Thanks
,

Ranique

are
asking
whether
I
would
need
to
be
assessed
or
supervised
by
a
job_title
or
not
.
It
is
organisation
so
I
would
assume
I
would
not
need
supervision
or
assessing
during
placement
if
I
am
correct
.
Thanks

Hi
I
have
gone
onto
the
website
but
it
still
says
it

sold
out

I

hoping
to
get
it
quick
before
it
sells
out
.
Thanks

Hi
Bernardina
,
I
have
some
questions
about
the
assignment
due
in
today
;
if
I
used
and
assessed
a
YouTube
video
,
should
I
mention
it
in
the
word
document
or
state
which
video
was
used
?
Also
,
on
the
PowerPoint
it
mentions
quite
a
bit
about
'
your
experience
'
however
would
I
need
to
pretend
that
I
was
involved
or
do
I
just
state
from
what
I
witnessed
in
the
video
.
Thanks
,
.
I
have
already
paid
for
the
annual
limitless
from
October
4446
to
December
6966
.
I
was
only
able
to
use
the
limitless
card
from
August
to
August
.
And
due
to
circumstances
I
wo
n’t
be
able
to
go
any
time
soon
.
Rather
than
extending
my
limitless
I
would
like
a
refund
for
the
months
it
was
not
is
use
.
I
would
not
like
to
take
the
extension
as
I
would
not
have
the
chance
to
go
cinema
therefore
a
refund
would
be
better
.
Thanks
Hi

Hi
Ace
,
Recently
I
received
my
grades
from
a
multiple
-
choice
exam
that
I
did
in
September
.
After
I
completed
the
exam
,
I
felt
quite
confident
that
I
did
well
,
but
my
grades
have
not
met
my
expectations
.
I
revised
quite
a
lot
for
it
and
most
of
the
questions
I
felt
positive
about
,
so
I
am
very
disappointed
with
the
number
of
marks
I
got
overall
.
Is
there
any
chance
you
could
look
into
it
and
check
the
marks
I
received
are
correct
and
that
there
were
no
mistakes
in
the
marking
?
I
would
very
much
appreciate
it
as
I
have
been
devasted
with
the
percentage
I
have
obtained
from
that
exam
.
It
was
for
the
module
module
1590
.
Thanks
,

Alayne

Thank
you
so
much
,
I
really
appreciate
the
extra
help
for
this
module

for
some
reason
I
checked
my
emails
on
Monday
morning
and
did
not
see
the
email
for
the
tutorial
catch
up
however
checking
my
emails
today
it
has
now
come
through
and
I
have
missed
the
meeting
.
Was
there
anything
important
I
missed
out
on
?
Also
,
I
was
hoping
to
get
some
advice
about
taking
a
placement
year
.

Hi

Thank
you

Monday
will
be

I

To

I
am
applying
to
be
a
volunteer

been
asked
to

down

I
was
hoping
I
could
put
your
name
down
as
a
referee
.
I
would
completely
understand
if
you
do
not
wish
to
however
it
would
mean
a

if
you
do

All
I

Dear
Professor
Alejandra
,
I
apologise
if
I
am
quite
late
to
apply
but
I
was
hoping
to
do
a
placement
year
next
year
starting
November
1564
.
I
took
extra
time
deciding
because
I
was
n't
sure
if
I
was
going
to
go
ahead
with
placement
due
to
the
way
COVID
19
is
going
,
however
after
discussing
the
benefits
with
my
personal
tutor
,
I
have
decided
I
would
like
to
do
a
placement
year
.
If
I
am
still
able
to
proceed
to
doing
a
placement
year
,
could
you
kindly
get
back
to
me
.

am
looking
to
book
an
accommodation
for
December
but
not
guaranteed
at
the
moment

Dear
Sir
or
Madam
My
name
is
.
and
I
am
a
second
year
course
student
at
university
.
For
the
next
academic
year
I
wish
to
do
a
placement
and
was
wondering
if
your
facility
takes
on
placement
students
.
It
would
be
a
great
opportunity
to
work
in
your
facility
as
I
am
interested
in
helping
patients
with
flu
or
asthma
.
I
believe
this
experience
would
help
me
to
gain
a
lot
of
knowledge
and
confidence
which
will
be
beneficial
for
my
future
career
.
My
placement
will
need
to
be
a
minimum
20
weeks
starting
anytime
from
July
4112
and
must
be
completed
by
July
1279
.
Below
is
a
handbook
which
will
provide
extra
information
and
I
will
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
you
may
have
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.
Yours
Faithfully
.
ould
like
to
apologise
for
sending
in
my
quiz
9
minutes
late
,
the
internet
in
my
house
does
n't
always
work
which
means
that
I
usually
go
to
the
library
to
send
off
any
assignments
.
Due
to
me
not
being
able
to
go
to
the
library
,
in
these
stressful
times
,
I
struggled
to
send
out
the
quiz
on
time
.
I
had
to
ask
my
neighbour
if
I
could
use
her
internet
to
send
my
quiz
off
.
I
hope
you
can
understand
and
was
wondering
if
I
could
not
be
penalised
for
it
.
-kind

Hi
Dareen
,
I
apologise
for
disturbing
you
but
I
have
been
feeling
really
stressed
lately
and
feel
as
if
I
am
struggling
to
keep
up
with
my
work
.
Being
at
home
is
making
it
difficult
for
me
to
concentrate
and
keep
on
track
with
the
assignments
that
I
still
need
to
do
especially
with
extensions
which
makes
it
more
confusing
.
Because
of
all
this
stress
and
anxiety
I
'm
starting
to
develop
monkey
pox
which
is
making
it
more
difficult
for
me
to
find
motivation
to
do
my
work
and
has
been
making
me
feel
poorly
lately
.
I
was
hoping
I
could
reach
out
to
you
so
you
could
provide
me
with
support
and
guidance
to
help
me
manage
my
uni
work
better
and
more
efficiently
so
that
I
feel
less
stress
.
I
would
appreciate
any
help
if
possible
.
-
.
Thank
you
so
much
for
the
support
,
I
will
take
a
look
through
all
the
links
you
have
sent
me
.
I
have
managed
to
send
an
email
to
the
university
organisation
for
further
support
,
now
just
waiting
for
them
to
get
in
touch
.
I
appreciate
your
help
through
this
difficult
time
.
-
.
Yes
,
that
would
be
great
,
thank
you
.
I
would
prefer
to

Dear
Tobias
,
I
am
writing
to
complain
about
the
outrageous
service
I
received
from
staff
at
business
in
Seattle
trying
to
start
a
fight
which
made
me
scared
until
the
other
workers
grabbed
Becca
and
pulled
him
back
.
This
could
have
potentially
put
our
life
at
risk
.
He
was
shouting
at
us
and
called
us
names
like
"
prick
"
and
I
will
not
accept
that
kind
of
behaviour
.
I
am
currently
in
the
process
of
receiving
camera
footage
from
neighbouring
shops
to
show
the
unexplainable
behaviour
by
the
member
of
staff
.
There
is
camera
footage
of
this
at
business
but
I
fear
returning
for
my
own
safety
as
well
as
my
boyfriends
.
Feel
free
to
obtain
the
recorded
phone
call
where
he
openly
promised
2
pizzas
and
gave
his
name
.
I
wish
to
hear
from
you
soon
.
.
Dear
CEO
,
These
are
what
I
was
able
to
find
with
the
list
you
have
given
me
:
I
found
a
central
hotel
called
Radisson
Blu
seaside
hotel
,
which
costs
£
91
per
night
and
£
181
for
2
nights
which
satisfies
your
budget
conditions
of
£
200
and
location
conditions
of
being
close
to
water
.
The
seafront
is
absolutely
stunning
so
I
think
you
'll
enjoy
it
.
The
hotel
has
a
restaurant
that
serves
breakfast
too
.
There
's
a
National
Museum
of
Finland
that
shows
Finland
's
history
starting
right
from
the

Intro
The
Alpha
Inhibition
Hypothesis
.
Discussion
The
results
were
significant
,
so
we
used
a
non
-
parametric
test
to
find
the
inferential
statistics
from
the
data
collected
.
The
results
fit
with
the
hypothesis
as
the
results
are
consistent
with
AIH
as
recorded
activity
from
P3cue
left
were
higher
than
cue
right
,
which
were
the
task
irrelevant
brain
areas
,
suggesting
that
alpha
suppression
happened
there
.
Methodological
issues
that
could
have
affected
the
results
could
have
been
varying
levels
of
impedance
,
associated
with
more
variance
in
the
measurements
but
would
affect
both
conditions
equally
.
Another
methodological
issue
that
could
have
affected
results
could
have
been
artefacts
,
such
as
blinking
,
that
would
affect
the
waves
.
From
the
experiment
overall
,
I
conclude
that
the
AIH
is
highly
supported
by
research
as
it
has
high
temporal
reliability
,
and
despite
all
the
methodological
issues
,
the
results
are
still
valid
.

Samsung

Thanks
sis
😊
I
guess
you
could
🤷
🏿‍

️
I
do
n’t
discriminate
😂
😂
it
do
be
like
that
sometimes
You
’re
learning
Russian
?
Oh
okay
,
yeah
I
heard
horror
stories
It
loan
?
And
where
?
It
was
with
business
last
year
And
they
said
I
’m
not
eligible
for
any
credit
cards
,
but
some
info
on
credit
karma
is
inaccurate
,
so
maybe
if
we
can
get
any
credit
builder
cards
with
bank
,
it
may
help
It
was
when
we
were
having
disagreements
about
money
.
Luckily
though
,
it
was
for
students
so
it
was
n’t
too
bad
.
Mummy
said
the
same
thing
.
Okay
Okay
,
if
that
will
help
build
my
score
then
I
can
agree
to
that
.
Yeah
I
have
to
change
my
address
on
it
,
but
I
’ll
do
that
later
.
Oh
still
?
Okay
,
I
'll
try
and
remove
it
later
hought
no
one
could
see
it
,
but
if
I
had
known
,
I
would
n't
have
put
it
up
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
if
people
are
not
on
linkedIn
becuase
of
work
,
then
they
should
n't
be
on
it
Okay
dad
Hi
dad
,
how
are
you
?
I
just
wanted
to
ask
,
how
long
does
the
Mexico
organisation
keep
passports
for
after
you
renew
them
?
Please
Oh
okay
,
and
the
visa
please
?
Yeah
,
I
remember
that
,
but
how
long
does
it
take
for
them
to
renew
it
?
Okay
,
one
more
question
,
does
the
visa
affect
my
America
passport
validity
or
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
?
dad
.
I
’m
good
thank
you
,
how
are
you
?
Yeah
you
’re
right
,
I
’ll
take
it
off
Okay
dad
,
please
check
if
you
can
see
my
number
now
Okay
,
do
you
mean
my
login
details
?
Actually
dad
,
opening
a
new
account
will
affect
my
credit
score
because
I
already
have
2
banks
plus
bank
Credit
karma
said
I
should
n’t
open
any
new
bank
accounts
now
bank
5
digit
passcode
:
1724
Oh
really
?
Because
I
have
n’t
had
my
bank
account
for
long
and
they
said
i
should
keep
that
one
open
as
it
’s
my
longest
I
’ve
had
a
bank
account
.
So
it
might
be
different
for
you
.
We
have
the
same
credit
score
,
you
’re
just
one
up
.
okay
Yeah
,
they
said
that
as
well
,
but
I
’m
not
in
a
financial
position
to
have
a
credit
building
card
because
I
do
n’t
have
a
job
,
so
if
I
miss
payments
it
’ll
negatively
affect
my
score
instead
.
Let
’s
wait
and
see
for
a
while
before
opening
another
bank
account
because
I
wo
n’t
need
it
now
,
but
thanks
for
thinking
about
me
dad
😊
Mmm
,
I
think
I
’d
prefer
the
money
because
I
wo
n’t
be
able
to
use
the
credit
👀
No
comment
😂
Okay
,
I
’ll
look
at
the
options
then
let
you
know
You
know
,
last
time
I
took
out
a
loan
it
actually
helped
my
score
when
I
paid
it
back
,
but
I
wo
n’t
be
taking
out
another
one
,
do
n’t
worry
.
I
had
to
pay
back
more
than
I
borrowed
Osborn
,
It
states
that
the
credits
I
received
for
the

study
have
been

,
could
I

why
?

It

she
still

make

official
one
.
I
do
n’t
mind
being
emailed
by
the
person
from
the
subject
department
for
any
ideas
,
but
Laurie
has
sent
a
lot
of
surveys
into
the
group
for
ideas
as
well
,
so
I
think
those
would
also
be
a
good
indication
on
the
direction
of
the
club
.
Always
happy
to
help
and
hope
to
hear
from
you

Introduction
The
topic
of
research
I
decided
to
study
is
why
it
’s
mostly
students
who
take
Humanities
and
social
sciences
degrees
;
specifically
,
Psychology
students
,
who
are
interested
in
East
Asian
cultures
such
as
Korean
culture
.
This
is
an
interesting
topic
to
explore
because
me
personally
and
people
around
me
,
have
experience
of
studying
Psychology
and
being
a
part
of
Korean
society
and
the
Japanese
and
Manga
Society
at
Aston
university
.
Most
of
the
members
of
Korean
society
are
Psychology
undergraduates
so
I
found
that
quite
interesting
and
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
an
actual
link
between
these
types
of
university
students
and
an
interest
in
East
Asian
culture
as
many
of
them
join
related
societies
such
as
the
ones
mentioned
previously
or
martial
arts
societies
from
these
specific
cultures
to
develop
their
interests
or
to
find
new
hobbies
and
interests
out
of
curiosity
.
My
main
research
question
is
‘
What
Psychology
students
’
experiences
are
in
being
interested
in
Korean
culture
?
’
I
decided
this
would
be
an
Interpretative
phenomenological
study
as
it
focuses
on
student
’s
personal
experiences
and
reasonings
behind
why
they
chose
to
study
Psychology
and
why
and
how
they
became
interested
in
Korean
culture
.
Interpretative
phenomenological
analysis
I
just
got
bored
of
watching
Western
stuff
"
this
suggests
Faith
’s
willingness
to
consume
media
and
entertainment
different
to
watch
she
usually
consumes
,
indicating
an
open
,
which
was
one
of
the
reasons
I
expressed
for
the
connection
of
Psychology
students
and
their
interest
in
Korean
culture
as
Psychology
students
usually
cultivate
an
open
mind
during
their
degrees
.
Through
this
analysis
of
the
themes
,
I
have
been
able
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
link
between
Psychology
students
’
experiences
with
interests
in
Korean
culture
whilst
focusing
on
Faith
and
what
her
experiences
are
.
The
link
is
related
to
the
benefits
of
open
mindedness
which
allows
you
to
find
new
interests
pr
develop
old
ones
that
you
previously
had
,
especially
open
mindedness
to
cultures
different
or
similar
to
your
own
but
in
another
societal
setting
.

Hi
there
,
I
’ve
filled
out
the
application
for
a
year
abroad
at
university
and
one
of
the
requirements
is
a
passport
number
.
I
’ve
applied
for
a
passport
in
November
and
have
yet
to
hear
from
home
office
,
it
seems
like
it
’s
being
delayed
due
to
COVID
.
I
’ll
also
be
going
to
my
national
high
commission
to
attain
a
renewed
biometric
ID
which
will
be
in
late
October
so
after
the
application
submission
deadline
.
Can
I
still
submit
my
application
using
my
old
passport
number
and
just
update
the
details
after
attaining
relevant
documents
please
?
If
not
,
is
there
anything
that
can
be
done
instead
?
Kind
regards
,

Hi

,
I
’ve

I

information

I
signed
up

you
doing

Okay
but
where
’s

?
🤔
I
was
looking

Errm
it
depends

what
you
’re
using
it
for
,
you
can
steam
it
Awe
,
sorry
to
hear
that
sis
😔
it
’s
honestly
a
lot
but
take
it
small
and
slow
Yeah
you
’re
right
,
hopefully
I
’ll
start
sleeping
more
Loool
,
it
’s
alright
x
😭
It
’s
true
!
I
wo
n’t
be
cooking
all
the
time
but
here
and
there
to
see
what
’s
it
like
Is
there
an
actual
application
link
?
?
Shit
,
I
just
found
the
email
!
😭
Go
to
your
student
email
and
type
in
Iraq
,
it
should
come
up
from
the
uni
there
,
I
’d
like
to
request
a
refund
for
sport
lessons
please
.
I
was
told
that
emailing
in
would
allow
me
to
receive
the
refund
online
,
instead
of
physically
coming
in
.
.
Refund
DDMMYYYY

Hi
Karyl
,
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
email
.
I
really
enjoyed
your
module
because
it
was
n’t
too
demanding
but
challenged
me
just
enough
and
I
learned
a
lot
of
new
skills
,
such
as
the
interdisciplinary
approach
to
a
diagnosis
in
task
1
.
It
was
also
doable
alongside
my
degree
modules
.
I
’m
happy
that
I
was
afforded
a
chance
to
boost
my
degree
whilst
learning
new
skills
.
If
I
was
in
charge
of
the
module
,
I
probably
would
have
just
done
different
activity
options
for
task
4
but
that
’s
just
due
to
individuality
.
Apart
from
that
,
I
would
n’t
change
anything
.
I
have
enjoyed
the
ease
in
which
I
was
able
to
complete
the
module
,
it
did
n’t
feel
like
it
was
too
demanding
and
the
support
you
provided
was
also
very
helpful
,
for
example
the
deadline
extensions
and
the
flexible
format
in
which
we
could
submit
our
work
.
Thank
you
so
much
!
Kind
regards

Hi

I
just
wanted
to
enquire
if
there

any

screen
for
cancer
or
any
covid
that
I
’m
unaware
of
.

Hello
,
Thankyou
for
this
.
Regarding
the
draft
for
the
critical
reflection
essay
,
which
is
due
at
the
end
of
this
month
,
I
was
just
wondering
how
many
words
it
should
be
.
Furthermore
for
the
reflective
assessment
questions
does
it
have
to
be
strictly
300
-
350
.
Would
we
get
penalised
if
it
is
a
few
words
under
or
over
.
I
wait
to
hear
back
favourably
Hello
,
Just
to
add
.
I
’m
struggling
with
what
the
actual
task
is
for
the
critical
reflection
essay
.
Are
we
making
up
our
own
research
question
and
then
answering
it
with
the
use
of
different
literature
reviews
?
Kind
regards
,
Thankyou
for
the
clear
guidance
.
My
placement
job
role
is
a

.
Therefore
regarding
the
critical
reflection
essay
I
am
just
wanting
to
know
if
this
is
a
suitable
question
I
can
do
my
essay
on
,
before
I
hand
in
my
draft
.
How
can
secondary
research
be
used
as
a
tool
to
develop
a
business
?
Thankyou
for
your
time
and
I
wait
to
hear
back
favourably
.
Hello

Introduction
.
This
strategy
paper
will
focus
on
combatting
the
maltreatment
of
house
girls
which
indicates
that
gender
inequality
still
exists
,
thus
being
perpetuated
through
the
form
of
violence
against
women
.
The
strategy
will
focus
on
passing
laws
to
criminalise
abusers
and
to
formalise
the
industry
by
establishing
policy
surrounding
working
pay
and
overall
job
protection
.
This
paper
will
begin
by
outlining
background
information
surrounding
the
role
of
house
girls
and
the
challenges
they
face
.
The
main
body
of
the
paper
will
then
express
the
previous
strategies
used
,
as
well
as
new
strategies
that
can
be
implemented
to
alleviate
the
problem
.
This
will
be
compared
to
the
context
of
South
African
legislation
to
show
their
success
in
emulating
such
an
issue
.
By
including
goals
,
theories
and
potential
allies
this
paper
will
provide
an
effective
solution
to
curve
the
rate
of
abuse
towards
house
girls
.
Lastly
the
conclusion
will
end
with
summarising
all
of
the
findings
that
seek
to
combat
the
issue
at
hand
.
What
is
a
house
girl
?
According
to
Oxford
dictionary
,
a
house
girl
is
"
defined
as
a
female
slave
who
works
in
a
house
.Therefore
the
same
legal
and
effective
approaches
must
be
taken
by
Nigerian
policy
makers
to
protect
the
rights
of
female
house
girls
with
potential
threats
that
they
could
be
faced
with
.
A
safe
haven
must
be
created
for
house
girls
who
have
been
victimised
thus
providing
severe
consequences
for
criminals
who
perform
and
assist
in
abusing
house
girls
.
This
unequivocally
will
drive
down
the
cases
of
abuse
.
Structurally
,
a
national
framework
protecting
house
girls
from
abuse
should
be
established
across
Nigeria
.
Law
enforcement
officers
are
fundamentally
necessary
at
the
frontline
of
the
criminal
justice
system
.
Their
attitude
and
response
towards
violence
against
house
girls
can
have
a
dramatic
impact
on
ensuring
the
prevention
of
future
violent
acts
and
that
the
protection
of
victims
are
upheld
.
Violence
against
women
and
girls
can
not
be
fought
by
women
alone
.
Thus
,
law
enforcement
officers
must
be
adequately
trained
and
compensated
so
that
they
willing
to
do
their
jobs
diligently
.
A
South
African
project
in
2000
successfully
provided
resources
for
facilitators
to
train
prosecutors
working
in
the
area
of
VAW
.
This
highlights
that
through
time
,
investment
and
attitudinal
changes
Government
efforts
can
be
effective
.
Conclusion
.
To
conclude
a
strategy
which
focuses
on
legislative
and
humanitarian
goals
is
crucial
in
reducing
the
rates
of
abuse
.
In
co
-
operation
with
the
Nigerian
government
the
strategies
presented
in
this
paper
will
improve
the
standard
of
living
for
house
girls
and
provide
a
modernised
criminal
justice
system
in
which
justice
can
be
ratified
if
any
women
has
been
treated
unfairly
.
It
will
also
push
house
girls
out
of
poverty
alleviation
and
give
women
the
tools
to
gain
workers
freedom
,
a
concept
that
should
be
universal
for
all
house
girls
across
the
globe
.
Ultimately
the
maltreatment
of
house
girls
in
Nigeria
is
challenging
to
dismantle
but
efficient
implementations
of
these
proposed
tactics
will
combat
the
maltreatment
of
house
girls
in
Nigeria
.

Or
is
there
something
else
involved

Dear
SirMadam
,
I
am
currently
a
young
adult
Carer
for
my
mother
who
is
suffering
from
flu
.
This
is
unpaid
and
I
am
currently
on
my
placement
year
which
is
voluntary
therefore
is
unpaid
.
I
therefore
am
requested
to
apply
to
the
organisation
bursary
and
have
seen
that
I
am
eligible
to
do
so
.
Please
may
I
be
directed
to
who
I
need
to
contact
in
order
to
move
forward
with
this
bursary
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
,
I
wait
to
hear
back
favourably
.

Dear

it
is
with
great
regret
to
inform

loss
of

pox

She
sadly
passed
away
the

Dear

upon

I
am
disappointed

I
have
never
received
such
a
mark
and
I
am
quite
shocked
at
the
grading
.
Please
may
we
book

to
discuss
the

together

That

Hello
I
have
a
key
point
I
wish
to
clarify
on
regarding
malcom
keay
and
when
he
mentions
how
the
uk
is
a
prisoner
of
its
ideological
past
stuck
inbetween
markets
and
controls
.
I
struggle
to
understand
what
he
means
by
this
is
simplistic
terms
.
Is
he
suggesting
that
the
uk
has
been
to
ambiguous
in
setting

Hello
,
I
was
calculating
my
module
credits
and
I
think
there
has
been
an
error
.
it
appears
that
I
am
doing
4
modules
on
the
subject
side
in
comparison
to
the
normal
3
that
I
'm
meant
to
do
.
My
credits
should
equal
120
however
they
equal
135
.
I
wish
to
get
this
amended
as
I
have
been
doing
more
than
the
average
student
.
I
wait
to
hear
back
as
soon
as
possible
so
this
error
can
be
resolved
.
Kind
regards
,
..
Hello
,
Yes
,
I
can
confirm
I
did
take
module
in
TP1
Yes
that
is
correct
Hello
,
I
really
wish
to
take
that
module
,
is
it
possible
for
me
to
remove
a
module
that
I
have
already
taken
under
the
circumstances
that
the
system
gave
me
too
many
modules
?
Kind
regards
,
Hello
,
I
seek
to
get
advice
regarding
my
module
selections
.
I
take
course
and
realised
today
that
I
was
taking
to
many
modules
in
TP1
.
the
lady
who
deals
with
the
module
selections
was
made
aware
and
removed
an
subject
module
from
TP2
to
balance
it
out
.
She
let
me
know
that
there
was
a
system
error
.
My
total
credits
before
this
amendment
equaled
135
instead
of
the
normal
120
.
This
is
how
I
was
able
to
spot
the
error
however
this
means
that
during
TP1
I
took
more
modules
then
necessary
.
this
means
that
academically
I
exerted
myself
more
than
necessary
.
whilst
the
subject
module
in
term
2
has
been
removed
it
was
in
fact
a
module
that
I
really
wanted
to
do
.
I
think
it
is
highly
unfair
that
I
am
unable
to
do
a
module
that
I
want
to
and
simply
removing
it
of
my
timetable
has
taken
away
my
freedom
in
choosing
what
I
want
to
study
.
I
asked
if
it
was
possible
for
me
to
remove
a
module
,
I
have
already
done
in
tp1
in
order
to
keep
the
module
I
want
.
Whilst
undertaking
a
specific
module
in
TP1
I
had
been
under
a
lot
of
academic
pressure
as
I
recently
have
been
beavered
.
This
has
been
challenging
for
me
and
was
reflected
in
my
grade
.
I
preformed
not
so
well
and
when
I
explained
my
circumstances
,
I
was
still
denied
the
opportunity
to
redo
the
assignment
only
to
now
find
out
now
that
it
was
not
even
necessary
for
me
to
take
that
module
.
The
grade
I
received
is
not
a
true
reflection
of
myself
and
the
combination
of
balancing
all
my
other
necessary
modules
whilst
dealing
with
the
passing
of
my
mother
did
take
a
toll
.
This
has
been
an
extremely
difficult
period
for
me
and
whilst
I
understand
the
standards
of
university
I
continue
to
reach
out
for
help
and
compassion
surrounding
my
personal
circumstances
.
I
therefore
would
like
to
present
two
options
.
Either
I
have
an
opportunity
to
re
do
my
assignment
which
I
failed
taking
in
the
considerations
of
my
personal
circumstances
and
the
fact
that
there
was
an
error
in
made
by
the
system
or
the
much
-
preferred
option
to
keep
the
module
that
I
'm
meant
to
do
in
TP2
and
remove
the
already
completed
module
from
TP1
.
Please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
for
any
questions
and
I
would
truly
appreciate
your
support
and
advice
during
this
time
.
I
think
this
would
also
be
best
discussed
via
a
meeting
on
MS
teams
to
avoid
any
confusion
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
.
Kind
regards
,

Hello
,
Regarding
my
attendence
I
do
n't
understand
as
to
why
it
would
be
less
than
50
%
.
The
other
day
I
checked
my
attendence
and
it
said
that
I
had
only
missed
8
classes
which
is
also
incorrect
as
I
had
attended
some
classes
which
seemed
to
say
I
was
not
present
,
Furthermore
every
single
lecture
and
seminar
I
have
been
to
I
have
never
failed
to
tap
in
my
student
card
and
wait
for
the
tick
to
dispay
.
I
beleieve
there
is
a
slight
problem
with
my
card
however
as
when
I
try
to
access
the
library
the
barriers
do
not
open
,
this
is
a
problem
which
I
need
to
sort
out
with
IT
and
may
be
the
reason
as
to
why
when
I
tap
my
card
it
does
nt
register
my
attendance
.
Regards
.
Hello
,
However
regarding
my
attendance
Is
there
any
way
it
could
be
changed
as
attendance
is
something
very
important
to
me
and
I
do
n't
want
it
on
my
the
system
that
I
have
been
to
less
than
50
%
of
my
classses
when
that
is
not
the
case
.
Thankyou
Regards

I
would
like
to
register
for
the
lecture
at

pm

Hello
sir
,
this
is
part
of
my
draft
for
the
assignment
due
on
the
3433
,
I
was
just
wondering
if
you
could
briefly
check
if
I
was
along
the
right
lines
for
this
assignment
.
Thank
you
I
wait
to
hear
back
favourable
.
..
yo
Hello
,
Thankyou
.
I
will
go
to
the
IT
help
desk
to
sort
out
this
problem
.
Therefore
emailing
my
lectureres
will
not
be
needed
.
Thankyou
for
that
suggestion
.
However
for
my
attendance
since
the
start
of
the
year
,
Is
there
no
way
in
amending
that
as
it
is
incorrect
and
is
permanently
recorded
wrong
.
I
have
been
to
the
organisation
and
they
had
to
give
me
a
new
student
card
.
Should
I
ask
them
to
email
you
about
this
so
that
they
can
confirm
with
you
that
there
was
fault
with
my
card
.
Thanks

a
bit
of
luck
would

Hey

No

I

the
only
question
I
have
now
is
when
I
need
to
be
there
to
set
up
?
I
emailed
Cobby
at
organisation
and
he
answered
most
of
the
others

Oh
and
just
making
sure
I
have
a
ticket
for
the
afterparty
.
Cheers

Just
need
to
know
what
time
they
want
me
there
in
case
they
want
a
sound
check
or
anything

Hey
Kenn
,
Aha
,
oh
well
,
I
'm
claiming

back
anyway
so
all
good
!
I
've
attached
the
certificate
.
I
'll
be
using
my
decks
,
wires
and
laptop
,
but
I
believe
Bendite
has
the
sound
system
covered
.
And
that
guestlist
would
be
brill
,
hoping
to
join
people
after
the
event
🙂

Hey
Verna
,
I
now
have
Public
Liability
covered
,
and
I
'
ve
emailed
Novelia
and
I
'll
be
heading
over
at
4.30
for
soundcheck
.
For
some
reason
the
afterparty
ticket
is
n't
available
to
me
on
the
organisation
page

says
I
need
to
be

Ah
yeah
cool

it
’s

Cheers
,
we
'll
try
to
drum
up
a
bit
more
of

would

to
see
it

Hi
Josephus
,
Just
wondering
,
is
the
minimum
20
weeks
based
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
5
days
per
week
or
would
the
minimum
still
be
20
weeks
if
the
placement
was
only
three
days
per
week
?
Cheers

Dear

I
have
just

a
charity
focused
around
topic
.
They
run
a
specific
placement
scheme
throughout
the
year

I
am

to
complete
it

Madge

Aha
,
well
I
get
the
weekend
off
at
Easter
but
the
Wednesday
is
back
to
work
,
no
rest
for
the
wicked
.
It
’s
actually
looking
like
I
’m
going
to
be
staying
on
at
organisation
after
the
placement
ends
,
but
as
a
paid
worker
until
I
come
back
to
San
Fransisco
,
but
I
’m
having
a
two
week
break
between
the
placement
ending
and
the
paid
work
beginning
.
I
did
see
that
email
but
I
was
n’t
sure
when
the
deadline
was
?
I
’m
sure
I
could
put
something
together
though
,
I
’m
not
starting
bar
work
for
a
few
weeks
yet
so
I
’ve
got
pretty
much
half
the
week
free
to
do
things
like
this
!
If
you
let
me
know
when
the
deadline
is
I
’ll
see
if
I
can
get
a
audiovisual
thing
done
in
time
?

Heya
Cain

Yeah
sounds
good

I

Hey
guys
,
I
’m
a
placement
year
university
course
student
putting
together
a
little
charity
project
in
San
Jose
,
and
I
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
way
to
contact
society
about
it
to
see
if
anyone
would
want
to
help
out
?
It
’s
quite
a
tech
-
heavy
venture
so
we
need
someone
who
knows
there
way
around
computer
programming
to
sort
of
oversee
the
technology
side
this
year
.
Is
there
any
chance
you
could
ask
your
members
if
anyone
would
be
interested
?
Thank
you
,
.
Oh
and
also
it
’s
only
available
on
that
link
for
7
days
so
if
you
do
n’t
get
round
to
downloading
it
by
then
just
let
me
know
and
I
’ll
send
it
again
.
Have
a
great
Easter
!
Hey

The
Stroop
Test
,
first
developed
in
1935
by
John
R.
Stroop
,
was
designed
to
study
the
effect
of
interference
when
presented
with
pairs
of
conflicting
stimuli
,
as
it
suggests
that
unattended
stimuli
can
influence
our
conscious
thoughts
and
actions
.
However
,
there
were
some
methodological
issues
with
this
study
.
In
this
experiment
,
every
participant
received
a
slightly
differently
worded
brief
as
there
was
no
standardised
instructions
created
for
the
study
and
all
briefs
were
given
by
different
investigators
.
There
was
also
the
issue
of
multiple
trial
situations
.
Sections
of
the
participant
group
undertook
the
study
at
different
times
of
day
,
different
days
and
in
different
rooms
.
This
may
have
influenced
the
results
collected
and
should
have
been
controlled
for
by
having
all
participants
complete
the
study
at
the
same
time
under
the
same
conditions
.
There
is
a
wide
range
of
modifications
to
this
experiment
that
could
be
made
to
study
the
different
aspects
of
the
original
Stroop
test
,
one
of
which
is
to
explore
the
effects
of
context
and
internal
state
of
participants
on
response
time
.
Again
,
there
are
several
ways
this
could
be
conducted
in
order
to
produce
evidence
to
support
real
world
debates
,
one
of
which
is
to
test
the
effects
of
chemical
imbalances
on
the
Stroop
test
.
Although
it
could
be
modified
further
to
make
it
more
applicable
to
the
real
world
,
at
a
basic
level
the
original
Stroop
test
could
be
conducted
under
the
influence
of
various
chemical
substances
,
e.g.
Alcohol
,
to
test
the
effects
of
these
chemicals
on
perception
of
target
stimuli
in
the
presence
of
distractors
.
Thank
you
😊
😊
Aww
thank
you
!
!
Apparently
I
’m
not
so
I
’m
heading
to
the
gym
😂
😂
Will
do
😂
😂
Ooh
very
nice
!
Finished
my
placement
!
!
Yes
he
just
called
me
about
it
😑
I
said
we
’d
do
his
thing
on
the
8547
And
we
’ll
do
a
proper
brunch
on
the
3391
Assuming
Ainsley
can
come
down
on
the
6782
Ugh
but
he
does
n’t
actually
want
to
do
what
I
want
to
do
,
and
it
’s
just
me
listening
to
him
organise
what
he
wants
to
do
Breakfast
in
the
morning
,
dinner
in
the
evening
,
but
apparently
he
does
n’t
want
to
do
that
so
I
said
he
can
change
his
plan
then
Melamie
,
Lovely
to
hear
from
you
,
yes
my
placement
is
going
very
well
thank
you
!
I
will
be
off
for
about
a
week
and
a
half
for
a
break
around
Christmas
and
New
Year
,
and
apart
from
the
occasional
edit
to
the
placement
assessments
I
’ll
be
making
it
a
priority
to
do
as
little
as
humanly
possible
for
10
days
!
!
I
will
probably
have
some
last
minute
questions
when
I
start
looking
over
my
drafts
,
I
’ll
try
to
send
them
all
over
in
one
.
Hope
you
have
a
great
Christmas
!
Cheers

Dear
Pru
,
Thank
you

I
have
done

When
is

run
?

Hey

Thanks

I
have
now
received
it
!
Cheers

Dear
Maureen
,
I
must
admit
I
have
completely
put
my
research
poster
on
the
backburner
for
the
past
couple
of
months
,
as
I
finished
my
draft
poster
but
had
to
wait
for
my
actual
draft
proposal
to
be
accepted
and
fed
-
back
on
before
finalising
my
poster
and
editing
it
.
I
found
your
last
email
so
unbelievably
helpful
in
sparking
ideas
for
my
poster
,
and
in
turn
my
final
year
research
idea
,
and
I
thought
I
’d
send
over
my
draft
poster
as
it
was
before
the
feedback
was
given
.
Any
thoughts
are
always
extremely
appreciated
,
but
of
course
no
direct
feedback
on
the
content
of
the
research
poster
draft
as
I
imagine
that
would
break
some
rules
!
I
imagine
I
will
be
in
touch
more
in
October
when
I
come
to
actually
conduct
a
study
in
this
area
.
In
regard
to
my
plans
for
scaling
the
research
down
to
something
that
could
be
achieved
in
an
undergraduate
dissertation
,
at
the
moment
I
fully
intend
to
"
go
bold
"
and
find
some
way
of
administering
CBD
to
subjects
on
some
scale
but
will
definitely
make
some
back
-
up
plans
in
case
this
proves
impossible
.
Thank
you
for
sending
through
those
risk
assessment
and
application
documents
,
now
I
am
back
in
the
Uni
-
work
headspace
I
will
have
a
crack
at
them
!
Again
,
thank
you
so
much
for
all
your
support
,
it
feels
brilliant
to
have
someone
to
discuss
this
sort
of
thing
with
!
Cheers
,
.
Ps
.
Good
luck
with
maternity
leave
!

Dear
Mrs
Botago
,
I
've
done
some
research
into
some
of
the
top
places
in
Helsinki
you
might
want
to
try
whilst
you
're
there
,
and
I
'll
copy
in
the
bookings
team
so
they
have
the
addresses
if
you
want
them
.
The
hotel
I
'd
recommend
is
the
Hilton
Helsinki
Strand
,
it
was
that
or
the
Radisson
Blu
but
the
Hilton
had
better
rooms
with
a
view
.
-
Kanavaranta
7
F
,
00160
,
Helsinki
,
Finland
.
If
you
're
looking
for
a
souvenier
for
Esmerelda
,
there
's
a
traditional
-
type
souvenier
shop
'
Liopro
'
just
off
Helsinki
's
central
market
square
,
plus
it
gives
you
a
chance
to
give
the
market
a
look
.
There
's
also
a
massive
'
Flying
Tiger
'
in
the
city
centre
,
it
's
not
traditional
Finland
but
it
's
brightly
-
coloured
Copenhagen
-
themed
stuff
,
probably
a
better
bet
for
a
young
kid
if
I
'm
honest
.
For
that
night
out
,
there
's
a
brilliant
looking
rock
club
called
'
Tavastia
'
nearby
,
live
music
and
apparently
one
of
Europe
's
oldest
rock
clubs
?
Worth
a
shot
,
if
you
're
not
a
fan
there
's
always
a
bar
by
the
sea
!
Anyway
those
are
the
ones
I
found
,
have
a
look
on
tripadvisor
and
see
if
there
's
anything
else
you
'd
be
up
for
while
you
're
there
?
Have
fun
!
Cheers
,
Mike
Dear
organisation
,
Please
could
you
confirm
this
can
be
done
?
There
is
a
lot
of
travel
involved
in
my
placement
and
the
travel
card
is
needed
as
soon
as
possible
!
Thank
you

Hi

Yes
sorry
it
was
a
mistake
,
please
can
you
delete
it
?
Thank
you

Dear
Dr
Jennica
,
I
must
admit
I
was
very
excited
when
I
heard
you
were
my
placement
tutor
as
your
introduction
talk
was
a
fairly
large
factor
in
me
choosing
university
!
I
am
currently
undertaking
an
unpaid
placement
at
the
business_descr
'
organisation
'
.
As
a
placement
involving
lots
of
travel
around
San
Antonio
and
a
lot
of
one
-
to
-
one
contact
,
the
role
has
been
affected
by
the
Coronavirus
.
As
it
stands
now
,
my
role
involves
providing
long
-
term
support
to
a
variety
of
clients
,
either
in
their
homes
or
in
the
community
,
and
helping
them
to
live
independent
and
fulfilling
lives
.
This
can
mean
emotional
support
through
difficult
times
,
practical
support
like
cleaning
or
home
administration
,
and
in
some
cases
monitoring
specific
aspects
of
client
's
mental
and
physical
health
such
as
whether
medication
has
been
taken
that
day
or
not
.
Notes
are
kept
on
all
client
visits
to
obtain
a
clear
picture
of
their
general
wellbeing
,
and
to
flag
any
concerns
or
changes
in
the
condition
of
clients
.
Additionally
,
I
should
have
access
to
the
following
courses
throughout
the
year
,
Covid
allowing

My
supervisor
's

As
for
the
Zoom
meeting
with
my
supervisor
and
myself
,
I
usually
have
a
supervision
Zoom
meeting
every
Thursday
morning
,
so
any
Tuesday
that
works
for
you
would
be
good
.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
you
this
year
!

,
how

This
essay
shall
address
the
question
"
What
are
the
core
assumptions
and
key
features
of
the
biological
and
psychoanalytical
perspectives
in
psychology
?
In
what
ways
are
they
similar
and
how
do
they
differ
?
"
.
Each
approach
has
their
own
individual
assumptions
and
features
,
some
of
which
are
strengths
and
some
of
which
are
weaknesses
,
but
each
perspective
has
its
place
in
psychological
science
as
they
can
both
be
used
in
suitable
situations
,
with
the
Biological
approach
being
a
more
scientific
,

based
,
utilitarian
perspective
,
and
the
Psychoanalytical
approach
being
a
more
theoretical
,
subjective
,
purity
focused
perspective
towards
psychology
.
For
example
,
it
could
be
argued
that
the
theory
of
personality
structure
has
very
limited
practical
use
as
the
I
d
,
Ego
and
Superego
can
not
be
directly
interfered
with
,
even
though
it
is
a
possible
explanation
to
help
psychologists
understand
behavior
.
To
conclude
,
both
the
Biological
and
the
Psychoanalytic
have
some
similar
key
features
and
core
assumptions
,
and
others
that
differ
between
the
two
.
Each
perspective
has
its
own
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
their
own
practical
applications
.
Inevitably
there
will
always
be
individuals
who
strongly
disagree
with
one
or
the
other
,
but
given
the
chance
each
approach
has
something
to
offer
modern
view
of
psychology
.

Dear
Temple
,
I
am
a
placement
student
on
the
course
course
at
university
.
I
took
part
in
your
research
study
last
year
,
and
I
had
a
couple
of
questions
I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
out
with
?
I
am
currently
thinking
about
my
final
year
dissertation
project
,
and
was
wondering
if
you
could
tell
me
about
how
you
got
approval
for
the
supplement
you
were
looking
at
in
your
study
?
I
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
remember
what
the
supplement
was
,
but
I
remember
eating
spinach
and
rice
at
9
am
!
I
am
not
even
sure
I
would
be
able
to
investigate
the
effects
of
a
supplement
at
undergraduate
level
as
it
would
probably
take
too
long
to
complete
in
such
a
short
time
,
but
I
was
wondering
what
went
into
getting
approval
to
use
a
specific
supplement
in
your
research
?
I
would
guess
that
there
would
be
a
'
side
effectsrisk
of
allergy'-type
ethical
argument
?
Any
info
you
could
give
me
would
be
hugely
appreciated
,
it
's
a
bit
early
for
me
to
be
thinking
about
disso
but
with
lockdown
I
've
got
a
lot
of
time
on
my
hands
and
thought
I
'd
have
a
look
.
Many
thanks

.
Rakel
,
Thanks
so
much
for
the
detailed
reply
,
I
've
been
meaning
to
get
back
to
you
for
ages
but
placement
got
a
bit
hectic
!
It
's
not
so
much
that
my
placement
has
inspired
me
to
investigate
a
particular
supplement
but
rather
helped
me
to
hone
in
on
the
exact
effects
I
'm
thinking
of
investigating
.
Since
moving
to
Los
Angelos
I
've
seen
an
insanely
steep
increase
in
the
amount
of
CBD
products
being
advertised
in
customer
-
facing
businesses
,
from
CBD
oils
and
oral
sprays
in
health
shops
to
being
offered
a
'
CBD
latte
'
in
a
coffee
shop
I
was
in
recently
.
Most
of
these
use
vaguely
worded
claims
that
CBD
helps
with
sleep
,
anxiety
,
chronic
pain
,
and
a
whole
list
of
other
things
.
In
business
I
found
a
60ml
bottle
of
"
double
strength
CBD
"
.
The
'
no
underlying
conditions
'
thing
had
not
occurred
to
me
but
I
imagine
it
would
be
a
must
-
have
for
this
kind
of
research
.
There
is
a
bit
of
an
issue
around
what
CBD
is
classified
as
in
the
UK
,
as
it
does
n't
seem
to
be
approved
as
a
medication
or
a
food
product
,
but
looking
at
it
now
this
might
be
beneficial
as
I
might
be
able
to
frame
it
as
a
food
supplement
.
It
's
all
a
bit
theoretical
at
the
moment
,
but
I
think
I
am
going
to
base
part
of
my
placement
assessment
on
the
idea
as
we
have
to
do
a
research
proposal
poster
anyway
,
why
not
make
it
something
that
could
help
next
year
?
If
I
'm
allowed
to
do
this
sort
of
research
practically
in
final
year
the
randomised
placebo
controlled
trial
idea
would
definitely
be
the
one
I
'd
go
with
I
think
,
just
seems
like
the
widely
-
accepted
best
way
to
go
with
this
sort
of
research
!
Looking
back
on
this
email
it
looks
like
a
bit
of
a
brain
-
dump
so
sorry
about
that
,
but
your
advice
really
helped
me
with
starting
the
methodology
research
so
thank
you
so
much
for
your
email
!
Any
musings
on
the
whole
idea
would
be
greatly
appreciated
,
it
's
a
topic
I
find
ridiculously
interesting
so
any
chance
to
discuss
research
options
is
amazing
!
Thank
you

not

Hi

I
have

from
Qualtrics
which
Wiatt
said
should
serve
as
proof
of
consent
I
believe
.
With
that
said
,
I
can
not
thank
you
enough
for
all
the
help
you
have
been
throughout
this
project
.
You
have
been
a
great

Thank

as
going
to
hold
them
for
half
a
year
but
like
i
said
if
they
spike
quickly
to
like
45
bb
and
50
+
pltr
i
might
sell
Even
40
bb
Depends
how
nice
pl
looks
Oke
Would
be
£
1000
profit
altogether
About
950
I
d
probably
sell
before
them
tbh
That
would
double
my
portfolio
lol
I
d
be
at
like
1.6k
Hopefully
it
even
reaches
40
And
pltr
highest
was
42
so
50
is
manageable
So
damm
illegal
On
bb
they
ve
legit
reversed
price
back
to
2
days
ago
Holy

In

it

I
was

if
could
you
elaborate
on
what
substantial
component
means
,
does
this
mean
placement
assignments
or
what
your
work
was
based
on
at
placement
.
As
my
placement
was
based
on

,
does
this
mean
i

the

Hi
tutors
,
I
know
you
are
in
the
process
of
still
sorting
out
optional
modules
in
timetables
,
but
I
have
not
received
a
timetable
at
all
meanwhile
it
seems
everyone
else
has
got
their
'
generic
'
timetable
.
Could
I
please
get
an
update
on
if
others
are
also
still
waiting
?
Thanks
in
advance
.
Kind
regards

4th
Year

Jesus
,
See
attached
for
reflective
log
3
,
nothing
really
noteworthy
.
You
also
asked
to
email
you
regarding
the
umbrella
ethics
,
I
think
my
project
would
come
under
both
experimental
due
to
the
paradigm
and
also
questionnairesurvey
.
Due
to
this
,
would
I
need
to
make
a
merged
participant
info
sheet
and
consent
form
?
As
they
have
different
forms
in
their
respective
folders
for
ethics
.
Also
,
I
had
a
query
about
the
risk
assessment
,
how
many
times
are
we
expected
to
perform
a
risk
review
?
As
right
now
my
hazards
table
is
not
very
populated
and
there
are
no
'
further
actions
'
I
would
need
to
make
at
this
stage
.

Hi
Rudolph
,
I
am
part
of
your
module
module
cohort
in
final
year
,
I
had
a
question
about
the
methods
section
of
the
proposal
.
Is
it
worth
adding
in
any
Cronbach
alpha
numbers
regarding
any
materials
that
are
being
used
?
Also
,
should
the
proposal
have
any
sort
of
discussion
points
regarding
limitations
of
the
design
or
if
any
relevant
things
are
beyond
the
scope
of
the
proposed
study
?
Thanks

in

Hi
Tomasina
,
I
saw
your
email
address
as
a
contact
regarding
Qualtrics
account
management
.
My
name
is
.
and
I
am
a
final
year
course
student
.
I
have
just
attempted
to
try
to
create
an
account
,
but
it
says
my
account
is
already
registered
with
Qualtrics
so
I
can
not
sign
up
using
my
university
email
.
I
also
tried
logging
in
using
it
,
but
it
says
my

is
disabled
.
How
should
I
proceed
?
Thanks
in

Jan
,
Sorry
for
the
huge
misunderstanding
concerning
accepting
your
changes
.
I
did
not
know
that
you
could
do
the
review
thing
online
,
I
have
been
emailing
over
the
newest
versions
via
my
most
recent
emails
,
I
have
just
been
to
check
the
old
email
thread
and
although
I
see
the
review
toolbox
it
only
allows
me
to
further
edit
and
I
do
n't
see
a
button
to
formally
accept
changes
.
In
the
last
email
I
sent
you
should
see
the
newest
versions
,
with
the
accepted
changes
.
As
per
your
last
email
,
I
have
now
embedded
i
d
numbers
and
changed
the
consent
form
to
reflect
your
ideas
,
you
mentioned
that
I
could
not
award
credits
to
those
that
declined
at
consent
but
how
would
I
know
who
had
not
completed
the
study
?
Also
,
I
changed
the
questionnaire
validation
to
request
rather
than
force
,
I
was
wondering
at
what
point
would
I
exclude
participant
data
if
they
refused
to
answer
questions
or
would
I
add
them
to
analysis
irrespective
of
the
amount
they
answered
?
Best
wishes

Hi
Deborah
,
I
have
attempted
to
accept
the
changes
,
please
do
tell
me
if
I
have
done
it
wrong
.
I
have
also
attached
the
debrief
as
the
version
on
the
email
thread
did
n't
already
include
the
date
change
for
the
lay
summary
.
I
have
also
checked
and
tested
the
new
block
you
have
added
,
thanks
for
doing
so
,
I
just
changed
the
block
options
as
per
my
other
email
with
everyone
else
.
Also
,
I
have
read
the
embedding
document
to
link
system
and
Qualtrics
together
and
am
ready
to
do
that
once
I
have
approval
.

Hi
Andra
,
I
have
now
changed
the
PIS
based
on
your
recommendation
.
I
did
n't
realise

in
there
,
I
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
dates
.
Best

Hi
Maddie
,
Yes
,
what
I
said
in
my
previous
email
will
also
help
with
that
.
You
put
the
'
close
window
'
block
underneath
the
branch
,
that
way
only
the
people
who
fail
to
give
consent
will
see
that
screen
.

Hi

as
you

be

I

been
placed

Given
the
current

I

we
will
be
able
to
work
effectively
together
and
end
up
with
a

I
have
a
couple
of
ideas
regarding
my
project
topic
,
which
do
seem
to
align
with
your
specified
areas
of
interest
but
besides
these
I
wanted
to
ask
if
you
had
any
specific
projects
you
were
interested
in
,
I
know
some
other

have
sent
out
their
own
recommendations

proposed
topic
that
I
submitted
earlier
was
about

of

n't
want
to
put
anyone
at

in
case
it
is
something
more

I
am
still
able

it

Hi
Simeon
,
See
attached
for
the
research
proposal
due
.
I
have
changed
the
study
to
use
the
topic
you
mentioned
as
it
aligned
with
the
literature
,
I
found
on
the
process
of
regulation
,
so
it
seemed
appropriate
.
Also
,
I
have
changed
the
topic
questionnaire
into
topic
as
during
literatures
search
I
found
a
significantly
worrying
amount
of
research
'
debunking
'
topic
as
a
concept
and
I
'm
not
sure
I
could
justify
looking
at
topic
in
terms
of
topic
following
that
.
All
other
aspects
are
unchanged
,
I
look
forward
to
hearing
your
thoughts

way
to

moving

after

Use
the

it
allows

to
hide
the

so
that

locked
out

Finally
,
to

it

Hi
Danell
,
I
had
a
query
about
the
slots
on
system
,
as
of
now
I
have
around
30
credited
responses
on
my
study
,
the
problem
is
the
rest
of
the
10
slots
are
all
taken
up
but
not
completed
I
think
as
system
says
no
credits
were
issued
for
them
.
Should
I
wait
a
couple
weeks
and
then
remove
these
participants
from
the
sign
up
if
they
have
n't
still
done
the
Qualtrics
,
so
the
slots
are
free
again

placement
in
organisation
which
is
needed
so
i
can
receive

This

very
well
overdue
as
their

university
were

This

should
also
state
my

this

out
urgently
as

how
to
get
access
to
system
for
my
study
but
unfortunately
the
folder
for
module
seems
to
be
locked
.
Is
this
a
known
issue
?
Thanks
in
advance

Hi
Alison
,
Ok
I
will
send
you
the
documents
on
Thursday
when
Qualtrics
is
finished
.
Thanks
for
adding
the
block
.
As
for
the
consent
,
I
added
validation
rules
that
all
participants
must
select
all
consent
statements
otherwise
they
can
not
proceed
past
the
consent
form
until
they
correctly
click
all
statements
indicated
by
them
turning
blue
,
but
I
do
understand
about
the
data
sharing
and
will
add
that
in
as
an
exception
to
the
rule
.
One
of
the
ideas
I
had
was
to
add
in
a
specific
script
for
an
'
I
do
not
agree
'
button
to
send
participants
to
the
end
of
the
survey
.
The
reason
I
did
n't
try
this
is
because
if
participants
click
do
not
agree
and
are
automatically
sent
to
the
end
,
it
will
act
as
a
loophole
to
get
free
credits
without
actually
doing
the
study
.
Also
will
run
through
the
survey
a
couple
times
prior
to
emailing
you
🙂
Best
wishes

Hi
Bengt
,
I
made
the
small
edits
you
mentioned
in
your
previous
email
,
I
was
wondering
if
there
is
any
evidence
or
anything
I
need
from
you
to
get
system
setup
by
the
admins
in
charge
of
it
.
Also
,
I
think
I
managed
to
do
the
randomisation
of
the
experimental
blocks
correctly
and
I
should
have
Qualtrics
finished
and
ready
to
go
by
Wednesday
,
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
check
it
for
me
before
I
set
it
up
with
system
the
following
week
.
Best
Wishes

Hi
Tammy
,
Sorry
for
the
delay
,
it
took
longer
than
expected
to
streamline
the
questionnaire
process
.
I
have
attached
all
the
relevant
ethics
documents
and
the
Qualtrics
is
finished
.
I
also
previewed
all
blocks
of
the
survey
to
check
validation
rules
and
the
randomisation
of
the
experimental
blocks
,
I
have
set
it
to
be
completely
random
so
it
wo
n't
display
the
3
blocks
an
even
amount
of
time
either
.
Look
forward
to
hearing
what
you
think
.
Best
Wishes

Danelle
,
I
was
wondering
if
you
know
who
is
going
to
mark
the
placement
assignment
drafts
and
when
feedback
will
be
released
?
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Haley
,
Unfortunately
i
will
not
be
able
to
attend
as
i
am
working
on
placement
and
ca
nt
take
time
off
to
attend
rep
meetings
.
I
am
a
rep
for
placement
year
course
.
Feedback
i
have
received
from
students
:
-Students
have
been
struggling
with
the
communication
with
placement
team
in
emails
,
students
have
to
chase
up
a
lot
and
the
team
does
not
report
back
any
changes
in
any
processing
.
-There
is
also
a
confusion
regarding
the
required
150
days
of
work
,
does
it
account
for
annual
leave
given
by
employers
and
how
is
it
tracked
,
will
it
be
signed
off
on
by
employers
?
-Some
placement
tutors
have
been
hard
to
get
in
touch
with
and
sort
out
a
date
with
for
the
visit
required
.
Others
such
as
my
own
have
been
really
good
and
visits
have
been
very
well
communicated
.
-Students
feel
like
they
would
want
drop
in
’s
for
support
on
reflective
writing
later
on
in
the
year
before
the
assignment
deadline
.
-Student
identified
lack
of
communication
on
when
assignment
drafts
will
be
marked
and
fed
-
back
.
Which
is
vital
to
completing
the
assignment
.
Kindest
regards

Hi
Sivert
,
Just
a
little
background
,
,
my
placement
is
with
the
organisation
which
business_descr
,
so
my
assignment
will
be
surrounding
that
.
Also
an
update
,
with
the
current
pandemic
i
am
soon
moving
to
mostly
remote
working
but
may
have
to
go
into
work
on
the
odd
occasion
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Park
,
I
will
not
be
able
to
attend
as
i
am
still
remote
working
in
the
organisation
and
have
virtual
meetings
around
that
period
.
I
have
not
been
told
much
by
students
about
many
concerns
.
There
is
some
wide
worry
about
how
the
coming
of
this
next
academic
year
will
be
,
like
the
technicalities
of
going
into
final
yearmeeting
supervisors
and
starting
projects
if
the
pandemic
is
still
a
threat
.
Thanks
.

Elysee

I
was
wondering
if
I
can
change
slightly
the
analysis
method
of
the
data
due
to
it
no
longer
being
appropriate
for
all
of
it
.
For
context
I
said
in
the
ethics
I
would
do
a
hierarchal
regression
of
suppression
and
cognitive
re
-
appraisal
with
the
DV
,
but
I
did
not
realise
it
would
not
compute
them
separately
instead
it
adds
them
together
as
1
model
.
Instead
,
I
wanted
to
do
simple
linear
regressions
for
both
of
those
and
then
a
hierarchal
afterward
but
only
for
the
variance
gender
and
ethnicity
added
.
Also
,
I
had
done
preliminary
analysis
and
was
wondering
whether
I
could
do
further
exploratory
analysis
for
later
discussion
points
that
I
could
have
a
meeting
with
you
,
as
I
need
to
go
through
all
the
comments
before
talking
to
you
,
but
I
am
also
conscious
there
are
days
where
staff
are
not
working
in
between
.
As
for
the
masters
at
university
,
it
is
an
course
.

Hi

currently
applying

Hi
Gerrard
,
See
attached
for
all
of
the
ethics
files
,
was
hoping
you
would
be
able
to
go
through
them
before
our
supervision
meeting
on
Wednesday
,
if
not
that
's
ok
.
The
only
thing
I
'm
unsure
of
is
the
analysis
method
,
I
have
put
down
a
standard
multiple
regression
but
wanted
to
hear
your
thoughts
on
that
.
Also
,
my
Qualtrics
is
up
and
running
so
you
are
free
to
send
over
the
experimental
part
.
Thanks

Hi
LeeAnn
,
I
had
a
quick
question
about
the
manuscript
evaluation
,
the
boxes
say
to
list
the
potential
biases
for
each
section
.
Does
this
mean
we
are
not
to
describe
anything
outside
of
just
bullet
pointing
,
for
example
'
citation
bias
'
.
Or
do
I
need
to
explain
the
citation
bias
there
too
?
Thanks
in
advance

Hi
Karylin

It
would
be
under

experimental
ethics
umbrella

Also
,
I
have
access
to
Qualtrics
now
you
are
free
to
send
me
the

you
need
me
to

Hi
Sayer
,
I
have
edited
all
the
files
based
on
your
feedback
and
have
changed
the
analysis
method
slightly
after
reading
up
some
more
on
regression
.
I
hope
everything
is
ok
after
these
edits
,
please

I
have
also
attached

Hi

Hello
,
I
completed
the
tasks
for
your
online
lecture
today
.
Since
the
presentation
task
was
directly
after
the
first
video
,
I
completed
it
and
submitted
it
as
I
was
trying
to
do
the
tasks
in
order
.
Only
when
I
reached
the
bottom
of
the
tasks
did
I
recognise
it
was
due
on
the
3052
,
which
means
it
likely
requires
more
time
than
it
took
me
to
complete
it
.
Is
there
any
way
I
can
withdraw
my
submission
or
make
a
new
one
closer
to
the
time
?
Apologies
for
the
mistake
.
Many
thanks

Hello
,
I
'm
not
sure
if
the
applications
have
closed
.
People
can
still
apply
for
the
'
job_title
'
role
.
In
their
automated
response
to
my
application
they
said
they
would
be
'
reviewing
all
applications
'
.
I
'm
guessing
they
will
receive
many
applications
because
they
're
such
a
big
company
that
seem
very
attractive
.
I
might
email
them
.
Is
it
worth
mentioning
in
an
email
to
them
that
I
may
get
an
offer
from
another
company
but
want
to
hear
from
business
before
I
make
my
decision
?
Or
does
that
sound
too
pushycome
across
in
the
wrong
way
?
Thanks
,

Hello
,
I
think
it
went
really
well
.
They
asked
me
when
I
am
available
to
start
and
said
they
would
contact
me
sometime
next
week
.
I
'm
still
waiting
to
hear
from
business
as
I
'm
hoping
they
will
also
give
me
an
interview
.
Especially
because
I
could
n't
really
make
organisation
wait
for
me
to
get
that
interview
,
because
I
'm
guessing
they
would
just
change
their
mind
about
employing
me
?

The
introduction
to
this
essay
will
explain
doping
as
a
form
of
corruption
and
will
cite
statistics
to
convey
the
extent
of
its
effect
on
sport
.
This
will
be
accompanied
by
an
examination
of
what
the
spirit
of
sport
is
.
This
essay
's
critical
debate
aims
to
expose
WADA
's
ineffectiveness
in
ensuring
that
the
spirit
of
sport
triumphs
over
the
doping
corruption
.
In
this
regard
,
WADA
's
loose
grip
on
national
and
sport
’s
governing
bodies
can
be
seen
to
disrupt
clean
athletes
.
The
debate
then
will
shift
to
how
WADA
's
code
is
fundamentally
discriminatory
against
athletes
from
developing
countries
,
causing
less
privileged
athletes
to
face
harsher
realities
for
the
committing
the
same
offences
as
their
contestants
.
These
problems
are
exacerbated
by
corruption
in
different
countries
where
the
punishments
handed
down
by
authorities
do
not
reflect
the
crimes
.
The
eventual
finding
is
that
WADA
is
unsuccessful
because
it
lacks
necessary
authority
.
This
essay
will
also
offer
a
critique
of
the
proposal
of
legalised
doping
,
shedding
light
on
its
shortcomings
.
It
will
be
concluded
that
an
increase
in
WADA
’s
power
is
required
for
the
spirit
of
sport
.
The
conclusion
is
that
WADA
will
only
be
able
to
promote
the
spirit
of
sport
effectively
when
they
are
the
final
arbiter
in
enforcing
the
code
.
This
essay
includes
insights
from
Sports
science
,
medicine
,
sociology
,
ethics
,
psychology
and
economics
to
support
its
claims
.
Corruption
is
defined
as
‘
dishonest
or
illegal
behaviour
,
especially
of
people
in
authority
’
.
Gorse
and
Chadwick
suggest
corruption
in
sport
includes
illegal
,
immoral
or
non
-
ethical
activities
,
which
intentionally
seek
to
distort
the
outcome
of
a
sports
competition
for
one
or
more
parties
'
personal
benefit
.
,
Gorse
and
Chadwick
analysed
2,089
cases
of
corruption
in
sports
,
where
doping
was
present
in
95.64
%
of
cases
.
The
World
Anti
-
Doping
Agency
could
also
be
adversely
affected
by
lots
of
performance
enhancing
drugs
-
by
stressing
the
myocardium
in
such
individuals
they
would
be
prone
to
potentially
fatal
arrhythmia
.
Therefore
,
it
is
argued
that
legalising
a
controlled
doping
practise
would
produce
perhaps
as
much
injustice
as
the
current
system
.
Sport
can
,
however
,
proceed
in
several
ways
without
facilitating
the
use
of
substances
.
The
first
sub
-
two
-
hour
marathon
ran
by
Eliud
Kipchoge
demonstrates
how
the
use
of
mechanical
help
can
produce
new
records
.
For
cycling
,
athletes
could
use
mechanically
assisted
bikes
to
help
with
hilly
terrain
.
This
is
much
safer
than
doping
,
however
it
is
WADA
that
really
needs
to
change
.
Conclusion
It
has
been
argued
that
WADA
’s
actions
have
not
contributed
to
the
sporting
spirit
.
WADA
should
have
a
much
bigger
say
on
the
enforcement
of
the
code
,
because
its
suggestions
are
often
discarded
by
organisations
for
whom
the
spirt
of
sport
is
not
always
a
significant
objective
.
The
proposal
of
controlled
doping
is
not
a
suitable
alternative
.
In
the
end
,
if
the
authors
of
the
universal
anti
-
doping
rules
are
eventually
made
the
ultimate
arbiter
,
it
will
create
an
effective
governing
organisation
with
more
power
to
actively
ensure
the
spirit
of
sport
.
10:30
is
fine

Hi
,
It
's
understandable
.
In
a
way
I
'm
glad
they
are
disappointed
,
as
maybe
this
speaks
to
the
value
they
saw
in
me
.
I
've
had
a
good
day
as
I
've
received
word
I
got
a
first
in
one
of
my
assignments
,
too
!
My
interview
with
the
organisation
went
very
well
,
and
I
got
along
with
them
quite
a
lot
.
Without
going
there
I
would
n't
have
realised
how
attractive
the
position
actually
is
.
When
I
hopefully
confirm
my
position
with
organisation
I
will
ask
the
organisation
if
I
can
work
for
them
in
my
summer
holiday
,
as
they
seem
very
nice
and
could
give
me
some
excellent
experience
!
I
just
gave
organisation
a
call
.
Nevins
sounded
as
if
he
understood
but
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
they
felt
I
was
very
suitable
for
the
role
.
So
I
'm
sad
to
have
let
him
down
:
on
Sunday
to
confirm
my
place
.
What
should
I
now
do
regarding
the
organisation
?
Thanks
,
..

He

he

only
a
small
amount
about
each
topic
I
've
made
a
lot
of
claims
in
my
essay
surely
he
will
have
to
fact
check
them
or
see
if
I
'm
right
The
geezer
I
peer
reviewed
talked
about
the
relationship
between
economic
development
and

an

Steffie
,
Thanks
for
emailing
me
,
I
'm
sorry
that
it
has
taken
a
while
for
me
to
respond
.
I
'm
currently
working
on
2
different
assignments
,
but
hopefully
I
'll
finish
them
soon
so
that
I
can
focus
on
this
poster
I
have
to
make
.
There
are
three
themes
to
pick
from
for
my
poster
,
and
I
have
to
link
the
topic
of
my
poster
to
one
of
these
themes
.
I
think
I
will
probably
choose
this
theme
:
'
assignment_title
'
.
Soon
I
will
have
to
decide
a
topic
that
links
to
this
theme
,
but
I
'm
not
really
sure
what
that
will
be
yet
...
I
've
been
thinking
with
linking
it
to
the
topic
of
topic
and
how
there
is
a
clear
economic
disparity
between
people
who
are
rich
and
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
get
it
done
in
other
countries
.
I
'll
join
the
Tuesday
room
at
the
scheduled
time
.
🙂
Many
thanks

Hi
Amargo
,
I
have
a
system
appointment
booked
with
you
at
4PM
.
If
it
is
better
for
you
to
use
one
of
the
seminar
system
rooms
instead
of
calling
,
I
'm
happy
to
do
that
also
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Terrill
,
I
hope
everything
is
well
with
you
.
I
am
emailing
because
I
have
finished
my
assignment
but
wanted
to
ask
a
question
before
I
submit
.
In
this
assignment
I
have
not
mentioned
the
names
of
cases
within
the
main
text
.
I
have
instead
stated
the
legal
principle
and
cited
the
appropriate
legal
authority
in
a
footnote
.
For
example
:
copied_text
My
question
:
Is
this
acceptable
,
or
do
you
need
me
to
also
mention
the
name
of
the
case
within
the
main
body
of
my
answer
?
This
may
seem
like
a
silly
question
,
but
if
I
am
advising
the
executors
and
trustees
of
the
will
,
I
did
not
consider
that
they
would
care
about
the
cases
that
I
am
citing
,
only
the
legal
principles
that
concern
each
clause
.
I
hope
this
makes
sense
.
Many
thanks
,
..
Klaus

Just
wanted
to
say
thank
you

Hi
Georgetta
,
I
have
since
changed
the
focus
of
my
work
.
Your
feedback
suggested
I
could
just
focus
on
a
particular
type
of
topic
,
such
as
the
topic
of

.
I
have
since
been
writing
about
:
assignment_title
.
'
I
hoped
this
would
allow
me
to
talk
about
things
like
:
Introduction
to
what
topic
is
and
why
it
is
important
to
regulate
it
UNESCO
guidelines
,
UKAD
,
NGB
's
,
etc
·
Where
should
regulation
begin
-
I
have
tried
to

Hello
I
was
wondering
if
you
still
needed
people
to
participate
in
your
study
?
If
not
that
's
fine
and
I
hope
it
goes
well
for
you
!
Thanks
,
..
Hello
,
That
's
fine
.
It
's
probably
not
the
popular
option
.
The
only
reason
I
selected
it
is
because
commuting
into
the
University
can
be
a
pain
at
the
time
that
the
appointment
slot
was
available
in
.
If
Skype
is
n't
too
troublesome
then
I
'm
free
from
2
-
3:30
tomorrow
.
Thanks
for
the
quick
response

Hello
,
I
had
booked
a
meeting
with
you
to
talk
about
placements
.
It
was
scheduled
for
2:40
-
3:00
.
When
booking
I
saw
that
it
was
possible
to
tick
a
box
saying
that
you
would
rather
be
contacted
by
Skype
,
and
so
I
added
my
username
.
Unfortunately
I
did
n't
hear
from
you
in
that
time
,
and
was
just
wondering
if
it
is
no
longer
an
option
to
hold
these
discussions
over
Skype
?
Maybe
you
were
unable
to
contact
me
?
Thanks
in
advance
for
your
response

Hello
,
While
it
is
unfair
to
expect
you
to
remember
me
specifically
,
you
taught
course
at
my
institution
and
I
had
a
keen
interest
in
your
subject
and
profession
,
achieving
a
1st
Class
in
that
module
.
I
am
writing
with
the
hope
that
,
should
it
be
convenient
for
you
,
you
would
willing
to
provide
a
reference
to
potential
employers
upon
my
application
to
placement
opportunities
within
my
placement
year
.
This
is
because
I
feel
you
knew
me
well
enough
and
I
also
have
a
good
understanding
of
the
topic
and
so
may
be
in
some
way
memorable
.
If
this
is
not
the
case
and
you
are
unable
to
do
so
,
I
would
like
to
thank
you
in
advance
for
your
correspondence
.
Regards
,
..
Hello
,
I
spoke
with
you
in
a
meeting
a
few
weeks
ago
and
you
helped
me
look
at
some
placement
opportunities
.
I
just
received
word
of
an
interview
with
the
organisation
team
on
Wednesday
or
Saturday
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
have
any
advice
for
me
?
Thanks

Hello

clarification
and
quick
response

I
'm
happy
to
add
more
and
submit
again

feel
there
is
something
missing

Hello
Rudyard
,
I
am
writing
this
email
because
I
have
made
a
mistake
regarding
the
assessment
proposal
for
the
module
module
.
I
have
confused
the
submission
date
of
the
assessment
proposal
with
a
different
submission
date
for
a
separate
module
.
I
would
like
to
apologise
as
I
understand
this
could
be
very
frustrating
for
you
.
I
have
never
missed
a
submission
deadline
at
university
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
miss
this
one
;
online
learning
has
been
difficult
for
me
due
to
mental
health
reasons
.
I
know
this
is
not
any
excuse
,
but
usually
I
receive
emails
from
Pearla
,
which
are
a
helpful
reminder
7
days
before
an
assignment
submission
date
.
Unfortunately
,
there
was
not
a
submission
reminder
for
this
deadline
.
I
was
wondering
what
I
can
do
to
rectify
this
?
I
am
currently
working
on
my
submission
for
this
module
,
along
with
an
assignment
for
another
module
due
on
the
9166
of
July
.
I
'm
going
to
try
and
do
everything
I
can
to
finish
it
within
the
next
few
days
so
that
I
can
send
it
to
you
.
I
was
just
hoping
that
this
error
wo
n't
stop
me
passing
the
module
as
I
have
been
enjoying
the
content
so
far
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
and
I
would
like
to
say
sorry
again
.
Many
thanks
,
..
Hello
Lydie
,
I
have
completed
my
proposal
over
the
last
two
days
so
I
apologise
if
there
are
any
problems
,
I
have
tried
to
finish
as
quickly
as
I
could
after
realising
I
confused
the
submission
date
.
I
will
also
attach
my
proposal
to
this
email
for
your
convenience
.
I
would
like
to
say
sorry
once
again
for
the
confusion
.

finished
my
assignment
and
plan
to
submit
soon
but
just
have
one
question
about
the
last
part
of
the
task
:
assignment_title
.
When
I
first
read
this
I
assumed
it
meant
that
I
could
talk
about
how
I
would
regulate
topic
in
one
paragraph
or
so
.
Thank
you
in
advance

Dear
CEO
,
I
have
found
two
hotels
,
both
close
to
the
water
.
The
first
is
called
Hotel
Katajanokka
;
it
is
rated
at
four
stars
,
is
available
on
your
dates
of
travel
,
and
is
Â£155
per
night
.
The
second
is
called
Hotel
Haven
;
it
is
rated
at
five
stars
,
available
at
your
chosen
dates
,
and
costs
Â£170
per
night
.
I
have
also
found
two
Cafes
.
The
first
is
called
Cafe
Engel
;
it
is
close
to
both
hotels
,
has
good
reviews
and
opens
at
8AM
.
The
second
is
called
Ekbery
1852
,
is
well
rated
and
opens
at
7:30AM
.
I
have
found
two
museums
that
will
allow
you
to
learn
about
Helsinki
's
history
.
The
first
is
Helsinki
city
museum
,
and
the
second
is
the
Museum
of
Finnish
Architecture
.
They
are
both
located
closely
to
your
hotel
.
I
have
found
two
restaurants
-
close
to
your
hotel
-
that
serve
Scandinavian
food
,
some
of
which
is
not
seafood
;
Ratvintola
Spis
and
Restaurant
Natura
.
I
have
located
a
shop
where
you
can
buy
gifts
for
your
children
,
it
is
called
Moomin
Shop
Lasipalatsi
.
I
have
found
three
things
for
you
to
do
in
the
evening
.
The
first
is
a
bar
called
Miliklubi
Bar
and
Disco
;
it
is
a
night
club
with
live
music
provided
by
a
DJ
,
it
has
cavern
style
seating
and
serves
drinks
.
There
are
also
two
live
music
concerts
on
the
3rd
of
September
which
you
can
attend
.
The
first
is
by
a
band
called
Korpiklani
.
They
play
metal
music
.
The
tickets
are
priced
at
25
euros
,
it
starts
at
7PM
.
The
second
concert
is
by
a
band
called
D
-
A
-
D
,
who
play
rock
music
.
The
tickets
are
priced
at
35
euros
and
the
event
starts
at
6PM
.
I
hope
you
can
find
something
you
like
based
on
these
recommendations
.
Many
thanks
,
Jack

Blondie

Thank
you

your
response
,
I

now
submitted
my
sample
work
attached

Hi
Ariel
,
I
've
got
a
sample
of
work
that
I
'm
happy
to
share
now
.
I
'm
sorry
if
it
has
taken
a
while
and
you
've
been
waiting
.
Do
you
have
a
google
email
,
so
I
can
share
it
with
you
via
google
docs
?
If
you
send
your
sample
,
I
'll
also
aim
to
complete
the
peer
review
task
ASAP
so
you
can
submit
.
Many
thanks

Hello
Sheffield
asked
if
it
was
a
possibility
.
I
do
not
want
to
move
from
where
I
live
though
as
I
want
to
help
support
my
mom
.
We
also
live
next
to
my
grandparents
,
and
I
want
to
help
them
where
possible
too
.
So
I
do
n't
really
see
myself
moving
.
The
main
reason
I
want
business
to
get
back
to
me
is
because
they
seem
to
encourage
a
healthy
lifestyle
.
Whereas
,
at
organisation
,
I
could
see
myself
sitting
in
the
car
for
a
long
time
commuting
,
being
sat
in
an
office
for
a
lot
of
the
day
and
not
much
choice
for
healthy
eatingany
exercise
.
I
could
n't
go
to
the
gym
after
a
9
hour
day
.
Following
learning
about
the
business
,
the
role
and
the
benefits
I
would
say
it
is
more
than
desirable
for
my
undergraduate
placement
year
.
I
feel
it
went
very
well
and
that
I
was
quite
good
despite
the
other
candidates
being
graduates
.
They
have
said
I
will
hear
back
within
five
working
days
maximum
.
Although
I
still
do
not
know
the
result
I
'm
thinking
it
could
be
the
best
option
for
me
and
something
I
would
consider
holding
out
for
.
I
am
available
to
call
to
discuss
this
tomorrow
at
your
convenience
,
so
feel
free
to
let
me
know
.
Many
thanks
,

Hello
I
have
just
formally
been
offered
my
placement
with
organisation
at
the
business
!
They
have
also
offered
to
let
me
work
part
time
through
the
summer
.
I
need
to
start
between
the
1942
of
August
and
861
August
-
obviously
my
preference
is
in
November
so
I
can
have
more
of
a
summer
.
Do
you
know
when
I
would
be
required
to
return
to
university
for
the
start
of
my
course
in
June
9301
?
Thanks
,
..
Hi
,
I
am
awaiting
my
contract
so
I
can
sign
it
.
What
documents
will
I
need
to
upload
?
Thanks
,
..
Hi
,
Just
thought
I
'd
let
you
know
I
've
done
my
first
few
weeks
part
time
at
the
business
where
I
'll
be
doing
my
placement
.
I
've
been
enjoying
it
so
far
.
I
hope
I
continue
to
enjoy
as
it
gets
busier
.
On
an
unrelated
note
,
did
anyone
hear
back
from
business
yet
?
😂
Thanks
,
..
Hi
Octavius
,
I
will
update
the
records
soon
and
send
you
the
information
you
need
.
You
're
going
to
hate
me
for
even
saying
this
,
but
I
've
been
thinking
of
working
part
time
and
volunteering
for
the
organisation
instead
.
This
is
mainly
because
of
me
not
being
able
to
commit
to
so
many
hours
anymore
,
and
also
because
I
'm
having
a
problem
at
the
minute
with
not
having
enough
breaks
at
work
.
I
'm
undecided
yet
,
but
if
you
have
any
insight
I
'd
love
to
hear
it
.
Thanks
in
advance
for
your
insight
and
sorry
if
you
have
a
heart
attack
reading
this
.
😂
Thanks
,

Hello
,
2
pm
is
fine
:)
Thanks
,
..
Hi
Aindrea
,
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
and
I
'm
still
in
two
minds
about
it
.
I
really
like
the
people
that
I
work
with
,
but
I
do
n't
think
that
's
a
reason
to
stay
in
a
job
because
people
will
always
come
and
go
but
I
'll
be
the
one
staying
there
for
the
year
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
need
to
find
a
way
to
do
less
hours
because
my
mom
is
changing
jobs
.
Also
,
the
restaurant
can
be
too
understaffed
to
provide
me
with
breaks
sometimes
and
sometimes
because
the
staff
are
confused
why
I
'd
want
one
on
7
hour
shifts
Thanks
,
.
cool
:)
what
we
thinking
of
doing
though
eating
right
?
think
i
need
to
shop
too
great
:)
any
preference
though
?
yeahh
i
think
i
want
to
get
some
dungarees
but
it
’s
so
hard
to
find
some
omg
yeah
i
’d
love
nandos
have
n’t
had
it
in
agesss
my
order
is
basic
though
what
do
you
get
i
should
get
something
new
yeah
maybe
i
’ll
try
online
shopping
for
it
first
black
jeans
what
kind
of
fit
?
ok
we
’ll
defo
eat
nandos
then
maybe
i
’ll
get
the
boneless
thighs
then
normally
i
just
get
the
burger
yeahh
it
’s
annoying
especially
when
websites
do
n’t
have
reviews
Deductive
and
Inductive
reasoning
are
examples
of
propositional
logic
to
construct
thoughts
into
a
valid
argument
.
Deductive
reasoning
begins
from
a
general
statement
that
leads
to
a
certain
conclusion
.
An
example
would
be
if
all
children
in
one
day
care
like
Legos
,
it
could
be
assumed
all
children
like
Legos
.
A
similarity
between
the
reasonings
are
that
they
are
both
used
to
provide
a
valid
argument
and
are
used
often
.
Another
similarity
is
that
both
reasonings
follow
premises
in
which
they
base
their
argument
on
.
A
difference
between
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
is
that
deductive
reasoning
begins
with
a
hypothesis
and
tests
the
hypothesis
via
an
observation
whilst
inductive
reasoning
begins
with
observations
and
then
moves
towards
a
theory
.
This
is
because
deductive
inference
is
based
upon
theory
whilst
inductive
inference
is
based
on
observations
.
There
is
also
a
difference
in
validity
between
the
reasonings
as
deductive
reasoning
is
more
precise
as
if
all
the
premises
are
true
then
the
conclusion
is
true
for
example
,
‘
if
all
dolphins
are
mammals
and
all
mammals
have
kidneys
,
all
dolphins
therefore
have
kidneys
.
’
However
,
even
if
the
premises
are
true
in
induction
,
the
conclusion
is
still
not
definitely
true
.
For
example
,
‘
if
the
first
button
I
get
out
of
a
bag
is
a
red
button
,
the
third
button
I
obtain
from
the
bag
is
red
,
therefore
it
is
inductive
logic
to
conclude
all
the
buttons
in
a
bag
are
red
.
’
Therefore
,
deduction
is
more
accurate
and
quantitative
whilst
induction
is
more
general
and
qualitative
.
Due
to
this
,
induction
is
used
more
in
everyday
life
as
it
is
harder
to
obtain
a
sequential
set
of
facts
that
are
known
to
be
true
in
deduction
.

Hi
Elysia
,
since
Thursday
I
’ve
been
vomiting
again
and
have
had
pain
in
my
lower
abdomen
,
I
rang
111
and
they
advised
me
to
take
pain
relief
and
see
if
it
gets
worse
and
since
it
’s
continued
I
had
a
gp
appointment
today
.
The
GP
told
me
he
thinks
it
is
an
abdomen
infection
so
I
’ve
been
advised
to
take
antibiotics
so
hopefully
the
pain
will
stop
.
I
am
so
sorry
but
I
do
n’t
think
I
will
be
able
to
come
into
school
tomorrow
or
Friday
,
I
will
keep
you
updated
with
my
health
and
if
the
antibiotics
help
to
stop
the
pain
.

you

should
i

days
for
us
guys
yeah
i
defo
want
at
least
something
off
in
July
i
’ve
asked
Sonny
do
u
wanna
do
more
abroad
or
uk
yeah
Olivette
just
said
that
is
it
bad
if
i
just
take
4
for
us
😔
so
like
Monday
Friday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Sigfried
said
take
4
i
wanted
Stony
Brook
ngl
because
i
loved
it
when
we
went
noo
the
first
place
we
went
to
?
it
was
Patchogue
😎
it
’s
so
hard
to
find
a
place
where
there
’s
a
nice
sofa
and
tv
that
’s
the
main
thing
i
want
but
ahh
ok
we
wo
n’t
do
Patchogue
then
or
what
areas
would
you
recommend
Subjective
Expected
Utility
theory
is
a
normative
theory
of
decision
making
was
proposed
which
explains
that
decision
making
is
based
upon
personal
gains
and
loss
aversions
.
Therefore
,
predicting
the
potential
decision
to
be
chosen
is
difficult
due
to
the
probability
of
the
decision
being
picked
being
distorted
as
probabilities
are
over
weighted
.
Deviations
can
also
be
explained
by
regret
theory
which
found
that
large
differences
are
over
weighted
whilst
small
differences
between
outcomes
are
underweighted
.
Regret
theory
is
also
based
upon
emotions
such
as
disappointment
,
rejoicing
,
regret
and
elation
which
are
anticipated
when
a
result
of
a
decision
is
known
.
How
the
amount
of
this
emotion
does
not
reflect
the
difference
between
outcomes
accurately
.
y
perfect
,
thank

Hi
,
i
'm
just
wondering
is
there
any
update
with
my
placement
application
as
i
know
lockdown
and
corona
are
creating
complications
around
placements
at
the
moment
.
Hi
Myriam
,
I
have
applied
to
a
couple
placements
and
I
'm
just
slightly
worried
due
to
corona
and
placements
as
the
main
placement
I
would
like
is
school
.
I
did
get
an
offer
for
a
meeting
with
the
headteacher
back
in
November
however
it
had
to
be
postponed
and
now
it
may
occur
in
November
but
still
some
uncertainty
due
to
corona
.
I
'm
just
wondering
about
the
possibility
of
me
still
not
getting
this
placement
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
due
to
July
being
quite
soon
already
and
I
do
n't
want
to
go
into
my
third
year
just
yet
.
I
have
applied
to
one
more
which
is
the
organisation
opportunity
with
university
and
I
will
try
and
apply
to
others
I
just
am
slightly
disheartened
due
to
lack
of
time
and
corona
.
Also
,
do
you
know
the
student
finance
deadline
?
As
that
s
another
worry
as
I
may
not
know
if
I
am
doing
a
placement
or
not
and
I
will
need
to
by
the
time
I
apply
for
student
finance
.
Thank
you
so
much
,
..

the
assignment
question
?
Thank

Ok
thank
you

That
helped
a
lot
,
also
with
the
deadline
my
friend
received
an
email
saying
how
there
is
a
5
working
day
no
penalty
for
students
because
of
corona
and
I
was
wondering
if
that
was
correct
Hi
Merell
,
Ok
thanks
!
!
You
can
let
me
know
what
days
you
’re
available
or
we
can
see
if
Herculie
replies

your
email
first
?
And
I
’m
wondering
is
the
deadline
for
the
assignment
on
the
1697
still
?
And
with
the
question
when
it
says
‘
studies
’
is
that
uni
as
a
general
thing
or
does
it
mean
specific
studies
in
course
that
we
have
learnt
about
?
Thank
you
,
.
Hi

sorry
!
The
230
were

be
going

because
of
my
supervisor
not
replying
,
what
is
the
next
day
you
are
available
?
Also
my
supervisor
’s
email
is
email_address

email

may
respond

of
placement
year
?
I
know
there
was
leniency
due
to
corona
however
is
it
different
in
my
scenario
due
to
it
being
a
school
?
This
is
what
I
wanted
to
discuss
in
video
call
with
you
however
no
one
from
the
school
is
responding
.
I
was
just
wondering
as
going
to
the
school
has
really
affected
my
mental
health
.
.

Hi
,
I
’m
one
of
the
placement
students
at
school
and
I
was
wondering
when
all
placement
students
are
expected
back
at
the
school
?
I
also
would
like
to
know
whether
I
am
able
to
experience
other
classrooms
within
the
school
rather
than
the
classroom
that
I
have
been
assigned
or
whether
that
’s
not
possible
?
.
Hi
Evette
,
Sherri
has
n’t
replied
to
my
email
yet
about
going
back
to
placement
but
I
was
just
wondering
in
regards
to
the
email
from
on
placement
support
,
so
I
fill
that
letter
out
and
what
goes
on
from
there
?
Thank
you
so
much
for
this
help
,
I
am
already
starting
to
feel
a
lot
of
relief
.
The
reason
why
people
find
Wason
’s
selection
task
difficult
is
because
people
find
it
difficult
to
identify
a
fallacy
when
it
is
used
in
an
abstract
reasoning
problem
explained
that
three
levels
of
insight
into
the
logical
structure
must
be
followed
in
order
to
get
an
insight
and
understanding
of
the
task
.
The
three
levels
include
occasions
supporting
the
rule
are
only
considered
important
,
occasions
supporting
in
addition
to
falsifying
the
rule
are
important
and
then
only
occasions
falsifying
the
rule
are
important
.
This
explains
why
the
selection
task
is
difficult
as
the
task
did
not
follow
the
three
levels
of
insight
,
leading
to
the
task
being
too
vague
and
therefore
hard
for
participants
to
gain
insight
and
full
understanding
of
the
logical
structure
of
the
problem
.
Creativity
refers
to
solutions
that
are
either
unusual
or
insightful
and
of
real
value
and
a
creative
solution
must
be
recognised
by
society
and
must
be
useful
or
valuable
to
people
.
When
studying
creativity
,
there
are
four
perspectives
which
are
usually
focused
on
,
they
include
:
creative
environments
,
creative
people
,
the
products
of
creativity
and
the
creative
process
.
The
two
major
approaches
that
are
used
to
study
creativity
are
the
biographic
and
autobiographic
approach
in
addition
to
the
psychometric
approach
.
The
biographic
and
autobiographic
approach
suggests
that
there
are
multiple
common
factors
which
are
needed
for
creative
achievements
.
Wallas
differentiated
between
divergent
and
convergent
thinking
.
Guildford
found
divergent
thinking
is
thinking
of
multiple
solutions
to
a
problem
whilst
convergent
thinking
is
converging
on
the
best
answer
to
a
problem
.
By
differentiating
the
two
,
Guilford
conceptualised
creativity
as
a
form
of
divergent
thinking
leading
to
psychometric
tests
being
used
to
asses
creativity
.
However
,
these
tests
mix
creativity
and
originality
in
addition
to
creativity
and
intelligence
which
can
be
a
problem
as
it
will
be
hard
to
assess
the
results
of
only
creativity
.
Child
development
can
be
defined
as
the
process
where
changes
in
language
,
thought
,
physical
and
emotional
changes
occur
in
children
from
birth
to
an
adult
,
going
from
total
dependence
to
independence
.
Development
is
influenced
by
many
things
such
as
biological
makeup
as
well
as
environmental
factors
such
as
economics
,
society
and
family
.
This
assignment
will
be
focussing
mainly
on
how
parenting
styles
impact
child
development
.
Baumrind
identified
three
parenting
styles
Authoritative
,
Authoritarian
and
Permissive
.
Authoritative
parenting
combines
having
high
expectations
and
enforcing
rules
in
addition
to
being
supportive
to
their
children
and
cooperating
with
them
.
Findings
show
that
children
raised
by
Authoritative
parents
are
more
likely
to
have
higher
education
achievement
and
better
mental
health
.
An
improvement
is
to
compare
the
effects
of
maternal
and
paternal
parenting
styles
on
a
child
’s
sleep
quality
.
A
strength
of
the
study
is
participants
were
Chinese
children
and
it
is
known
that
school
-
age
children
in
China
face
severe
poor
sleep
quality
in
addition
to
being
more
likely
to
be
influenced
by
style
of
parenting
therefore
the
findings
can
be
considered
representative
.
These
findings
provide
evidence
that
positive
parenting
plays
an
important
role
in
improving
children
’s
sleep
quality
and
knowledge
of
this
can
lead
to
targeted
interventions
to
improve
children
’s
sleep
quality
.
To
conclude
,
research
has
found
that
parenting
,
in
particular
,
parenting
styles
in
fact
do
have
an
impact
on
a
child
’s
development
in
different
aspects
.
Baumrind
found
the
three
different
parenting
styles
can
affect
educational
success
,
mental
health
and
even
the
prospect
of
drug
use
in
adulthood
.
For
example
,
Authoritative
parents
are
likely
to
have
children
who
excel
in
education
and
have
positive
mental
health
whilst
children
reared
by
Authoritarian
parents
are
more
likely
to
do
worse
in
education
.
The
parental
acceptance
-
rejection
theory
by
Rohner
also
found
that
parental
style
can
affect
a
child
’s
developmental
in
a
variety
of
ways
for
example
their
loneliness
levels
,
mindfulness
and
sleep
quality
.
Studies
found
parental
warmth
and
therefore
acceptance
from
the
parent
leads
to
lower
loneliness
,
higher
mindfulness
and
better
sleep
quality
in
children
and
the
opposite
finding
for
rejection
.
Overall
,
we
can
conclude
that
supportive
and
affectionate
parenting
with
a
balance
of
enforcing
rules
but
also
allowing
a
child
to
have
independence
,
leads
to
better
academic
achievement
and
mental
health
in
children
.

Hi
just
to
let
you
know
I
emailed
the
teacher
within
the
primary
placement
it
’s
nearly
been
a
week
and
a
half
and
she
has
n’t
responded
.
Hi
,
I
mainly
communicate
with
her
when
i
see
her
in
the
school
it
has
only
been
one
occasion
where
we
emailed
one
another
.
With
the
meeting
I
’m
wondering
if
it
will
be
a
group
meeting
with
the
3
of
us
?
As
I
would
like
to
also
get
the
chance
to
talk
to
you
about
placement
alone
?
Thank
you
for
being
patient
with
my
replies
I
’ve
just
been
quite
stressed
since

they
received

Hi
Hetty
,
I
am
emailing
you
because
my
placement
is
on
pending
and
has
been
for
a
few
weeks
now
.
Would
you
be
able
to
advise
me
on
what
it
may
be
that
I
need
to
upload
?
It
is
coming
up
to
the
deadline
of
submitting
my
placement
and
I
really
need
to
make
sure
that
the
placement
is
approved
.
Kinda
Regards
.
.
Hi
,
I
’ve
submitted
two
placement
records
,
the
second
with
outstanding
paperwork
but
neither
have
been
approved
and
they
have
been
pending
for
a
few
weeks
now
.
The
last
time
I
emailed
I
was
told
to
make
sure
I
had
correct
documents
uploaded
.
I
have
done
that
this
time
so
could
you
please
send
me
an
email
telling
me
what
is
it
I
need
to
upload
rather
than
a
generic
one
.
Kinda
Regards
,
.
Hi
,
I
have
sent
these
in
on
a
separate
placement
record
I
submitted
.
I
however
have
also
uploaded
them
to
the
placement
which
is
now
pending
approval
,
if
you
could
have
a
look
at
it
please
.
Kind

Hi
Hannah
,
I
was
in
the
middle
of
preparing
my
questionnaires
and
interviews
for
my
colleagues
,
however
interns
at
business
have
been
let
go
due
to
effects
of
the
coronavirus
.
This
will
obviously
affect
all
of
us
as
I
’ll
no
longer
be
able
to
do
my
primary
research
or
the
presentation
to
my
manager
etc
.
I
just
wanted
to
know
if
there
will
be
any
sort
of
changes
to
the
placement
guidelines
because
of
what
’s
happening
or
should
I
still
stick
to
what
we
were
originally
given
to
do
?

I
've
become
stuck
on
the

so
have
decided

change
it

Would
this
be
suitable
alongside
the
topic
?

Hi
Whitney
,
I
just
had
a
quick
question
regarding
the
coursework
.
In
terms
of
the
questions
we
ask
,
must
all
of
them
relate
to
the
workplace
.
And
if
they
do
n’t
,
for
example
if
we
ask
about
family
,
do
we
then
need
to
apply
it
to
the
workplace
?
Kind
Regards
,

Hi

I

days
to
submit
the
coursework
as
written

email
which
was
sent
to
us
,
or
is
the
deadline
the
9595
September
?
Kind

wanted

confirm

of
June
.
Also
if
the
assignment
submissions
page
shows
a
specific
date
e.g
1623
of
October
,
should
we
only
follow
that
?
Kind

Hi
Dr
Sari

The

work
is

I

I

Hi
Dorella
,
I
have
found
the
70
%
module
coursework
as
difficult
as
I
did
the
previous
one
.
If
I
do
n’t
pass
this
module
,
what
are
the
resit
options
?
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
For
one
of
the
modules
I
took
this
semester
,
module
,
I
failed
to
submit
the
coursework
as
I
found
it
too
hard
to
do
and
I
knew
I
would
fail
the
module
even
if
I
handed
it
in
.
What
are
my
options
following
this
?
Will
I
have
to
re
-
do
the
module
in
the
summer
where
it
is
capped
or
would
it
be
possible
to
choose
to
do
a
different
module
in
either
my
placement
year
or
fourth
year
as
I
know
if
I
was
to
do
module
again
,
I
would
still
fail
it
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Jessamine
,
I
was
wondering
where
to
hand
in
the
extenuating
circumstances
form
you
advised
me
to
fill
out
.
Can
I
email
it
to
you
,
or
do
I
have
to
hand
it
in
to
uni
somewhere
?
Also
where
you
’ve
said
it
is
my
decision
to
do
the
re
-
take
for
this
module
,
do
you
mean
module
?
I
think
I
will
wait
to
find
out
what
the
exam
board
decision
is
before
anything
.
Thank
you
,

Hi

Hi
Katusha
,
I
was
in
your
3851
class
for
module
and
did
n’t
pass
the
module
.
I
am
retaking
and
was
wondering
what
the
retake
would
be
?
Is
it
going
to
be
an
exam
,
a
new
coursework
or
the
same
coursework
?
Thank
you

Employee
relations
is
a
socio
-
economic
exchange
between
employer
and
employee
with
an
agreement
set
regarding
the
latter
’s
labour
power
and
capacity
to
work
.
which
saw
to
protect
people
’s
rights
and
ensure
fairness
and
equality
;
the
Government
provides
funding
for
the
company
and
works
with
it
when
progressing
human
rights
.
EHRC
has
helped
millions
of
people
since
it
was
started
up
but
in
2016
saw
devastating
cuts
to
its
funding
,
its
2007
budget
of
£
70million
was
to
be
cut
down
to
an
estimated
£
18million
in
2020
.
This
lack
of
funding
and
decreased
budget
would
have
very
negative
consequences
on
gender
inequality
;
EHRC
would
not
be
able
to
function
as
broadly
as
it
did
before
,
equality
would
not
be
monitored
and
maintained
as
efficiently
as
previous
years
.
In
the
UK
,
the
State
has
passed
legislations
and
regulations
in
the
hope
to
bring
about
gender
equality
.
They
have
also
established
different
bodies
to
help
combat
this
.
The
equality
act
2010
,
though
one
of
the
most
important
legislations
to
help
bring
about
diversity
and
equality
in
the
workplace
,
10
years
on
,
still
sees
significant
gaps
in
employment
of
men
and
women
.
The
gender
pay
gap
which
has
been
slowly
decreasing
,
sees
a
higher
pay
gap
between
the
two
genders
in
more
senior
roles
;
discouraging
women
to
try
and
climb
up
company
ladders
.
Government
should
have
stricter
rules
on
closing
the
gender
pay
gap
not
only
in
lower
paid
roles
but
higher
ones
too
,
encouraging
women
to
be
ambitious
in
themselves
.
An
introduction
for
a
NLW
for
more
vulnerable
women
such
as
single
mothers
should
be
introduced
as
they
may
struggle
than
most
with
the
set
NLW
,
better
flexible
working
arrangements
should
also
be
made
possible
in
all
types
of
organisations
,
not
just
after
a
26
weeks
’
tenure
.
There
should
also
be
stricter
repercussions
on
business
’
which
fail
to
report
their
gender
pay
gaps
as
a
few
not
following
guidelines
could
see
knock
-
on
effects
on
other
organisations
doing
the
same
.
Though
the
Government
is
doing
much
to
fight
gender
inequality
,
as
a
lawmaker
,
manager
of
economy
and
an
employer
,
it
has
a
long
way
to
go
to
completely
diminish
the
issue
.
It
time
When
Did
n’t
go
Okay
Could
n’t
be

Your
two
drawers

,
I
submitted
my
coursework
and
I
forgot
that
I
had
to
put
in
my
candidate
number
in
the
submission
line
.
Instead
I
just
put
‘
CV
’
.
What
should
I
do
about
this
?
I
ca
n’t
go
back
and
change
it
but
does
it
mean
that
you
wo
n’t
be
able
to
tell
which
submission
is
mine
?

interview
with
business
for
my
placement
year
on
the

.
I
had
all
my
work
stored
on
my
Laptop
and
my
laptop
has
broken
and
along
with
it
my
work
is
gone
.
I
am
restarting
on
my
sisters
laptop
but
I
have
no
idea
what
I
had
done
or
where
I
began
.
I
was
already
struggling
with
what
to
do
and
now
I
have
no
idea
all
over
again
.
If
it
is
possible
to
meet
,
please
get
back
to

.
Thank

Hi

if
there
was
any
possibility
of
doing
a
module
change
at
all
.
I
’m
studying
module
and
after
getting
a
first
in
it
last
year
I
thought
I
’d
enjoy
it
and
do
well
this
this
year
too
.
However
I
am
really
really
struggling
with
the
subject
and
do
not
understand
it
all
,
I
know
for
a
fact
that
I
will
probably
end
up
failing
it
this
term
and
I
do
n’t
want
that
to
happen
.
Would
it
be
possible
to
move
to
another
module
?
I
know
that
it
’s
late
into
the
semester
and
we
are
already
5
weeks
in
but
I
will
put
in
the
work
and
re
watch
all
the
lectures
at
home
and
do
all
the
work
that
needs
to
be
done
to
catch
up
to
the
point
where
the
students
of
the
module
are
already
on
.
The
module
I
was
wanting
to
move
to
is
module
.
I
know
a
few
people
studying
this
module
and
I
know
they
would
be
happy
to
help
me
if
I
needed
the
help
to
get
to
their
stage
.
Is
this
possible
at
all
?
I
’m
really
in
need
of
this
move
,
I
know
there
’s
no
point
committing
to
a
module
that
I
will
fail
in
for
sure
,
I
’d
rather
try
at
another
module
and
be
able
to
do
decently
in
it
.
Thank
you
,

Aridatha

I
’ve
got
my
results
for
my
modules
but
was
wondering
what
the
decision
was
in
terms
of
me
taking
a
second
year
module
through
to
my
final
year
?
Thank
you

Hi

Hi
Darice
,
I
just
wanted
to
know
what
my
options
were
if
i
was
to
fail
the
module
module
again
,
i
do
n't
have
high
hopes
for
this
coursework
again
as
i
am
really
struggling
with
it
and
working
in
my
placement
from
8
to
6
means
that
i
have
hardly
got
any
time
to
spend
on
it
.
What
would
happen
if
i
was
to
fail
again
?
would
that
mean
being
unable
to
progress
into
final
year
?
Are
there
any
other
options
than
this
.
Really
sorry
to
bother
you
especially
if
you
're
on
your
holidays
?
Kind

interviewed
and

accepted
last

I
do
not
wish
to
end

if

possible
to
switch
to
an
online
role

Compare
and
contrast
deductive
and
inductive
reasoning
.
Use
examples
to
explain
.
Deductive
reasoning
involves
logical
thinking
,
providing
us
with
the
means
to
determine
valid
arguments
in
one
’s
train
of
thought
.
Similarly
,
inductive
reasoning
is
a
way
of
increasing
semantic
information
through
generalisation
,
allowing
us
to
come
to
conclusions
about
whether
a
statement
is
true
or
false
.
Deductive
reasoning
is
similar
to
inductive
reasoning
in
that
concrete
or
previously
known
knowledge
affects
performance
on
experimental
tasks
measuring
components
of
ordinary
language
.
For
example
,
in
deductive
reasoning
,
our
own
beliefs
effect
the
validity
of
conclusions
we
make
because
our
world
knowledge
clouds
our
judgement
.

Psychometric
tests
in
assessing
creativity
have
produced
interesting
results
,
especially
the
observed
link
between
creativity
and
intelligence
,
however
these
methods
often
mix
creativity
and
intelligence
,
or
originality
and
creativity
.
That
is
,
creative
individuals
tend
to
have
high
IQ
,
but
not
all
high
IQ
individuals
are
creative
,
consequently
decreasing
the
validity
of
psychometric
tests
claiming
to
assess
creativity
.

Hi
,
When
in
uni
,
my
lecturers
said
that
you
can
opt
in
for
placement
and
your
course
end
date
changes
automatically
,
as
a
placement
is
n’t
compulsory
.
I
’ve
never
been
told
that
I
had
to
let
anyone
know
about
choosing
to
do
a
placement
.
Is
it
possible
for
you
to
change
my
course
end
date
please
?
Thanks
,
.
Hi
,
I
have
decided
since
starting
uni
at
university
that
I
am
going
to
do
a
placement
year
in
8590
-
1752
,
therefore
I
will
be
finishing

This
strategy
paper
will
focus
on
suggesting
realistic
solutions
to
the
problem
of
educational
gender
inequality
in
India
.
This
inequality
is
a
clear
problem
;
unequal
access
to
education
is
an
infringement
of
human
rights
.
If
this
gender
disparity
was
lessened
,
the
well
-
being
and
development
of
children
would
be
positively
impacted
,
as
well
as
the
economy
of
the
country
itself
.
Without
the
support
of
the
government
,
gender
equality
may
not
be
valued
.
However
,
this
can
be
counteracted
by
the
implementation
and
enforcement
of
new
laws
,
starting
within
the
education
sector
,
to
allow
women
and
young
girls
to
become
more
independent
and
assert
themselves
within
society
.

Dear
Alysa
,
Hope
you
are
well
and
keeping
safe
.
I
've
just
had
a
chat
with
one
of
my
mentee
's
who
is
quite
stressed
and
I
just
wanted
to
raise
a
few
concerns
regarding
placements
following
my
conversation
with
her
.
There
were
a
few
things
that
I
noted
from
the
conversation
including
:
She
felt
that
she
has
n't
been
given
enough
sufficient
guidance
and
support
from
the
placements
team
and
correspondence
about
what
placements
she
should
be
looking
for
and
when
she
did
try
to
make
an
appointment
with
the
placements
team
,
she
said
that
she
was
told
the
wrong
things
.
She
said
that
she
was
told
that
she
could
apply
for
non
-
international
placements
so
had
been
looking
for
placements
only
based
on
these
criteria
to
then
be
told
that
she
must
complete
an
international
placement
.
Furthermore
,
in
the
initial
appointment
she
had
been
told
that
she
would
have
some
placement
suggestions
to
be
sent
to
her
which
never
happened
.
She
said
that
she
feels
that
she
is
in
the
dark
about
the
whole
year
abroad
experienceprocess
of
application
and
this
has
made
her
really
stressed
about
it
.
I
have
told
her
to
make
another
appointment
with
the
placements
team
which
she
has
done
and
to
raise
all
of
this
in
the
appointment
and
how
she
feels
and
then
to
let
me
know
how
she
gets
on
.
I
just
felt
that
it
was
important
for
you
to
know
and
to
also
help
improve
the
assistance
given
by
the
placements
team
as
this
was
really
worrying
to
hear
as
a
mentor
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi

Hi
Helen
,
I
have
prepared
some
research
for
you
regarding
the
itinerary
for
your
trip
to
Helsinki
in
September
.
I
have
found
:
-
The
Hilton
Helsinki
Strand
is
a
4
*
central
location
hotel
,
which
overlooks
Finnish
waters
and
has
lots
of
facilities
such
as
a
fitness
centre
and
pool
for
£
173
per
night
.
-
Hallikahvila
is
a
5
*
reviewed
cafe
,
which
is
close
to
the
hotel
and
serves
a
variety
of
pastries
,
pancakes
and
breakfast
items
.
-
Restaurant
Skord
is
a
highly
rated
restaurant
,
which
serves
traditional
Finnish
food
and
has
many
options
aside
from
seafood
.
-
In
Helsinki
,
there
are
2
museums
which
could
be
of
interest
:
the
national
museum
of
Finland
and
the
Helsinki
city
museum
.
-
For
souvenir
shops
,
2
have
been
highly
rated
:
Anne
's
Shop
which
sells
more
traditional
Finnish
items
and
Roobertin
Herkku
which
sells
traditional
Finnish
sweet
goods
.
-
For
live
music
in
the
evening
,
the
jazz
club
Storyville
comes
highly
recommended
as
it
is
named
one
of
the
best
jazz
clubs
in
the
world
and
it
has
live
music
4
times
per
week
.
I
hope
that
this
has
proved
useful
to
you
and
matches
the
itinerary
that
you
requested
.
Raveen
Thank
you
😊
😊
see
you
later
!
!
xxxx
hahahaa
😂
😂
😂
😂
I
've
got
to
say
that
was
a
good
joke
Yeah
its
good
you
have
"
gone
into
work
"
but
also
realise
when
you
need
a
break
too
as
I
can
imagine
it
must
be
really
mentally
draining
for
you
.
Hahah
its
okay
I
probably
wo
n't
even
do
them
today
because
i
m
too
lazy
haha
😂
xxx
Yeah
i
ca
n't
even
imagine
!
!
Yeah
that
s
good
at
least
its
not
all
bad
😊
haha
yeah
although
I
'm
going
to
attempt
to
do
some
exercise
today
after
quite
some
time
😂
xxx
I
'll
let
you
know
because
i
m
not
sure
if
Lavinia
is
coming
down
again
!
!
But
yeah
it
sounds
good
with
me
😊
❤

about
your
leggings
😭
xxx
Haha
thank
you

I
😂
Awww
that
sounds
good
!
!
!
Sounds
busy
!
!
Weather
is
so
drab
at
the
moment
so
I
hope
it
clears
up
a
bit
more
for
you
xxx
Awww
thank
u
!
!
!
i
hope
you
've
had
a

a
different
day
but
I
'm
not
sure

let

tmrw
?
I
forgot
i
d
told
mum
I
'd
jetwash
all
of
the
tiles
in
the
garden
dxxx
yeahh
that
would
probably
be
better
if
it
was
in
the
evening
🤗
xxxxx
ust
got
it
from
cult
beauty
!
!
think
it
's
like
18
quid
but
it
's
a
spray
so
I
used
3
sprays
on
my
face
and
1
on
my
neck
in
the
mornings
!
!
It
has
n't
even
grown
back
yet
!
!
!
and
did
it
maybe
2
weeks
ago
now
xxxx
Yeah
my
upper
lip
has
surprisingly
not
really
grown
back
too
much
and
usually
I
have
to
wax
it
every
week
🤔
🤔
tbh
the
hair
regrowth
was
the
same
thing
that
bothered
me
about
trying
it
but
then
I
just
did
it
and
I
do
n't
regret
it
!
You
do
have
to
exfoliate
your
face
like
once
a
week
though
xxxx
Electra
,
It
's
no

Hi
Betty
,
I
was
told
by
Vita
that
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
.
I
have
a
groupwork
task
for
a
module
in
subject
,
where
we
must
discuss
what
impact
Brexit
has
on
people
moving
to
BrazilEuropean
countries
in
the
future
.
I
have
managed
to
find
information
about
the
impact
of
Europeans
coming
to
work
in
the
UK
but
not
the
other
way
around
.
Could
you
help
please
or
suggest
some
reading
if
possible
?
It
would
be
a
huge
help
and
appreciated
.

To

may

Hope
you
are
well

I
am
a
final
year
student
,
who
is
currently
doing
some
groupwork
and
was
wondering
if
you
could
provide
me
with
some
more
information
as
to
whether
the
Uni
does
partnerships
with
companies
for
graduate
schemes
and
if
they
so
how
much
does
the
University
charge
for
this
andor
paid
promotion
?
Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Kind
RegardsBeste
Grüße
.
Hi
Ernestine
,
I
just
need
a
rough
idea
about
how
partnerships
with
companies
work
as
I
am
doing
a
groupwork
task
which
involves
calculating
financial
costs
of
the
campaign
.
Our
campaign
is
that
we
are
a
country_adj
recruitment
coming
looking
for
business
graduates
to
come
and
trainwork
in
Iraq
.
This
is
for
a
module
called
module
,
I
became
way
more
confident
socially
and
in
my
academic
skills
,
I
became
even
more
independent
and
now
literally
feel
like
I
can
do
anything
.
Drawbacks
I
would
say
are
it
can
be
quite
hard
at
first
being
away
from
home
but
just
throw
yourself
into
it
and
you
'll
be
fine
,
as
mostly
everyone
speaks
english
.
There
are
n't
as
much
of
a
variety
of
English
courses
at
the
University
.
However
,
I
took
a
few
modules
in
English
that
I
really
enjoyed
,
so
just
try
anything
.
The
workload
was
okay
.
Iran
,
in
general
,
are
a
lot
more
intense
with
workload
but
do
n't
feel
overwhelmed
as
university
you
only
had
to
get
a
pass
to
get
the
credits
for
that
course
.
The
assessments
were
all
okay
too
-
if
you
speak
to
the
lecturers
they
generally
are
willing
to
make
the
assessments
easier
for
you
.
I
did
n't
actually
know
anyone
from
university
who
was
going
to
university
.
However
,
when
I
got
there
I
found
out
that
3
other
people
from
university
were
there
too
.
But
to
be
honest
,
the
main
friends
I
had
were
international
students
Hope
this
helps
!
Let
me
know
if
you
have
anymore
questions

Christiana
,
Honestly
,
it
's
scary
at
first
but
just
so
amazing
especially
because
and
do
n't
just
apply
for
anything
,
make
sure
you
apply
for
what
YOU
want
to
do
or
are
interested
in
as
the
placements
team
do
n't
really
take
this
into
consideration
.
I
made
both
but
for
a
study
placement
application
you
do
n't
need
one
you
just
have
to
write
a
short
essay
about
why
you
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
that
University
and
then
for
the
other
one
I
only
had
to
send
my
English
CV
but
i
would
recommend
doing
both
as
it
's
good
practice
for
the
future
and
there
are
modules
in
second
year
to
help
you
do
this
so
make
sure
you
use
the
language
assistants
as
much
as
possible
.
If
you
have
any
more
questions
,
please
let
me
know
🙂
.
Dear
Dea
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
just
wanted
to
ask
you
something
.
Following
the
last
email
,
that
I
had
sent
to
you
about
my
hospital
visit
whilst
on
placement
in
Philadelphia
,
my
health
still
has
n't
improved
so
I
am
considering
booking
a
flight
home
for
June
to
see
my
doctor
as
this
is
when
we
have
a
semester
break
.
However
,
I
have
a
block
course
in
July
for
4
days
which
is
worth
3
credits
and
was
just
wondering
if
I
would
be
penalised
if
I
did
n't
partake
in
it
?
This
would
mean
that
I
only
have
28
credits
for
this
semester
and
then
would
go
on
to
take
31
credits
next
semester
.
So
would
end
up
with
a
total
of
59
credits
instead
of
60
.
Please
can
you
let
me
know
if
this
is
acceptable
or
not
?
Thank
you
!
Kind
Regards
,
.
To
whom
this
may
concern
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
wanted
to
enquire
about
cancelling
an
accommodation
booking
for
September
8361
due
to
financial
reasons
as
a
results
of
COVID-19
Pandemic
.
Can
I
please
have
some
more
information
about
this
and
alternatively
can
I
be
given
some
information
about
adjusting
moving
in
dates
and
what
that
means
for
the
overall
cost
of
accommodation
?
Kind
Regards
,
.
Dear
Elsie
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
've
just
checked
system
and
I
'm
registered
for
a
module
that
I
had
changed
to
another
.
I
was
formerly
doing
module
but
have
since
changed
it
to
module
.
However
,
module
still
appears
on
system
.
Please
could
I
have
some
assistance
in
officially
confirming
what
modules
I
am
set
to
partake
in
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
Vivianna
,
Hope
you
are
well
!
!
My
name
is
.
and
I
'm
your
mentor
for
this
year
.
I
am
a
final
year
student
and
study
course
.
Please
feel
free
to
message
me
any
questions
whenever
and
contact
me
if
you
have
any
worries
or
problems
and
I
will
do
my
best
to
help
you
!
Kind
Regards

Hi
Demetris
!
!
So
nice
to
hear
from
you
so
quickly
!
!
Yes
I
know
it
's
just
such
a
strange
time
but
you
can
get
through
it
:)
Yes
of
course
,
that
's
what
I
'm
here
for
!
I
hope
I
can
support
you
as
best
as
I
can
in
whatever
way
is
helpful
for
you
.
So
I
did
a
study
placement
at
university
.
I
chose
to
do
a
study
placement
as
I
wanted
to
improve
my
Russian
language
skills
and
they
had
a
well
renowned
language
programme
at
the
University
.
The
experience
was
literally
one
of
the
best
things
I
've
done
in
my
life
.
I
met
so
many
people
of
different
nationalities
and
made
some
amazing
friends
as
well
as
really
improving
my
language
skills
.
If
you
want
anymore
information
let
me
know
.
It
was
really
hard
to
adjust
at
first
and
I
was
really
homesick
.
However
,
I
just
tried
to
integrate
myself
into
all
of
the
student
events
and
talk
to
as
many
people
as
possible
.
As
soon
as
I
made
friends
then
I
felt
a
bit
more
settled
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
feel
comfortable
in
using
Russian
day
to
day
.
However
,
you
'd
be
suprised
at
how
nice
people
are
and
they
just
appreciate
trying
to
speak
in
Spanish
so
just
really
go
for
it
.
I
wish
I
had
been
a
bit
more
confident
to
start
with
.
It
's
important
to
say
as
well
that
I
was
going
to
do
a
half
study
,
half
work
placement
at
first
but
decided
to
stick
with
study
as
that
was
what
was
best
for
me
.
But
I
would
highly
recommend
doing
half
and
half
as
you
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
also
it
looks
good
employability
wise
.
If
you
feel
that
you
really
struggle
with
grammar
etc
then
I
would
definitely
suggest
half
a
study
placement
as
it
will
aid
you
in
final
year
when
it
comes
to
dissertation
and
assessments
etc
.
Yes
please
message
me
whenever
and
I
will
keep
checking
in
on
you
as
I
really
understand
how
difficult
this
year
can
be
especially
in
the
current
climate
.
Kind
Regards
,
.
Thank
you
❤
️
❤
️
❤
️
really
appreciate
it
❤

maybe
we
can
walk
up
to
village
on
Sunday
and
go
for
breakfast
?

Yeah
yesterday
was
a
bit
productive
!
!
have
been
making
something
for
my
grandad
will
show
you
when
it
's
done
😊
whom
this
may
concern
,
My
name
is
.
and
I
would
like
to
know
if
there
are
any
potential
possibilities
of
doing
a
work
experience
placement
or
internship
within
organisation
during
my
gap
year
.
Working
with
children
has
always
been
a
passion
of
mine
.
I
aso
find
helping
children
very
fufilling
,
which
is
why
,
in
the
future
,
I
would
love
to
pursue
a
career
in
Paedeatrics
or
within
a
hospital
,
making
positive
changes
to
children
's
and
peoples
lives
.
I
believe
an
experience
like
this
is
very
valuable
and
would
help
to
shape
me
further
as
a
person
.
I
am
very
hardworking
and
am
always
up
to
taking
on
a
challenge
.
I
enjoy
interacting
with
many
different
types
of
people
and
have
a
cheery
disposition
.
I
find
that
this
experience
would
be
very
beneficial
in
the
future
.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
.
To
whom
this
may
concern
,
My
name
is
.
and
I
would
like
to
know
what
volunteering
opportuinites
there
are
within
organisation
.
Volunteering
has
always
been
a
strong
interest
of
mine
and
I
have
always
wanted
to
help
out
at
the
organisation
as
I
feel
it
would
be
very
beneficial
and
a
valuable
experience
in
developing
me
as
a
erson
.
I
also
wish
to
pursue
a
career
in
the
future
working
with
Women
so
I
feel
this
would
be
a
good
experience
in
being
able
to
see
if
I
could
cope
with
what
volunteering
would
have
to
offer
.
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
be
able
to
volunteer
for
the
organisation
.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
.
To
whom
this
may
concern
,
My
name
is
.
and
I
'm
4849
years
old
.
I
have
decided
to
take
a
gap
year
and
always
have
felt
that
volunteering
to
help
refugees
would
be
something
fufilling
.
I
am
extremely
impressed
and
interested
in
the
work
done
by
organisation
and
feel
that
they
do
a
lot
of
work
to
help
suffering
people
.
How
would
I
go
about
volunteering
with
you
?
Thank
you

To
whom
this
may
concern
,
business
is
a
brand
I
have
always
been
interested
.
I
have
been
using
business
for
a
few
years
and
have
noticed
the
difference
in
my
skin
.
I
would
like
to
work
for
business
as
I
want
to
provide
customers
with
the
same
experience
I
have
had
from
business
.
I
am
hardworking
,
reliable
and
a
fast

in

descriptions
of
different
roles
Make
a
mindmap
of
things
you
enjoy
doing
in
the
workplace
and
things
you
do
n't
to
narrow
down
your
searches
Make
a
mindmap
about
what
qualities
you
think
you
possess
and
what
you
would

found
!
!
Use
a
sieve
and
hot
water
and
rub
the
brush
on
the
sieve
!
!
xxx
I
put
it
in
the
microwave
and
it
cleans
quite
well
!
!
!
Or
I
put
it
in
a
sock
and
put
it
in
the
washing
machine
!
!
xxx
hahaha
yeah
same
then
Graig
told
me
about
this
hack
!
!
Nah
seriously
just
put
it
in
a
mug
of
water
and
fairy
liquid
and
keep
microwaving
it
for
30s
and
then
change
the
water
when
it
gets
too
dirty
😂
😂
works
a
treat
!
!
!
xxx
hahaha
yeah
I
know
the
feeling
!
!
!
I
just
washed
everything
to
give
me
something
to
do
😂

Dear
Arabela
,
I
'm
really
disappointed
with
how
organisation
has
handled
my
recurrent
noise
complaints
against
my
flatmate
.
I
have
had
to
contact
security
myself
6
times
within
the
last
2
weeks
and
my
flatmate
has
also
contacted
security
a
number
of
times
.
I
can
not
understand
why
this
flatmate
has
not
been
dealt
with
.
I
have
not
slept
in
3
weeks
due
to
his
constant
loud
noise
.
This
is
seriously
disturbing
my
life
at
Uni
and
more
importantly
disturbing
my
studies
and
that
of
my
other
flatmates
aswell
.
I
spoke
to
a
member
of
staff
at
the
organisation
Reception
at
building
on
Wednesday
4414
July
,
who
was
extremely
unhelpful
and
the
noise
still
continues
from
about
9
pm
to
8
am
everyday
.
I
was
told
that
the
problem
of
noise
complaints
was
only
dealt
with
by
security
but
since
they
are
not
getting
through
to
this
flatmate
,
it
should
be
escalated
to
yourselves
as
this
is
becoming
highly
unprofessional
and
is
not
the
student
care
I
expect
for
the
money
I
am
paying
for
my
accommodation
and
student
services
.
I
would
highly
appreciate
having
this
looked
into
immediately
and
looking
at
solutions
to
resolve
the
recurrent
noise
.
Kind
Regards
,
.
Hi
Patel
,
I
'm
really
sorry
but
can
I
rearrange
our
appointment
today
for
next
Sunday

speaking
class

I
completely
forgot
that
I
have
a
deadline
for
my
other
part
of
my
course
that
s
due
in
tommorrow
.
I
'm
really
sorry
!

Hi
Layney
,
I
was
just
wondering
why
my
mattress
has
n't
been
replaced
yet
?
I
did
as
instructed
in
the
email
and
a
mattress
still
has
n't
been
delivered
.
I
need
to
know
if
they
are
coming
today
for
definite
or
not
as
I
have
had
to
reschedule
my
day
due
to
the
mattress
replacement
.
If
they
are
not
coming
today
can
I
be
informed
of
a
new
date
an
time
as
soon
as
possible
.
Thank
you
.
Hi
Gabriell
,
Unfortunately
I
will
not
be
able
to
make
our
system
appointment
tomorrow
due
to
a
doctor
's
appointment
.
I
have
tried
to
cancel
it
on
system
and
rebook
for
next
week
but
it
is
not
allowing
me
to
so
thought
I
would
email
you
in
advance
,
as
I
did
n't
want
you
to
be
waiting
around
for
me
to
show
up
.
Thank
you

Hi
,
I
was
writing
in
the
hope
to
get
my
CV
checked
.
I
have
previously
spoken
to
a
colleague
and
completed
the
changes
as
requested
.
I
have
two
areas
of
concern
.
One
being
the
Interests
and
Achievements
section
,
as
I
feel
I
do
n't
really
have
anything
to
put
in
there
that
is
n't
already
elsewhere
on
my
CV
Hi
Gunilla
,
That
's
very
kind
.
I
have
attached
the
work
;
its
not
finalised
yet
with
layout
etc
.
I
hope
it
is
ok
to
send
it
with
anonymous
marking
and
whatnot
,
but
if
its
an
issue
,
do
n't
worry
,
I
can
try
to
figure
it
out
myself
-
would
n't
want
to
get
you
or
myself
in
any
trouble
🙂
Thanks
again
,
.
Hi
Faun
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
know
it
’s
a
bit
late
to
be
emailing
about
the
essay
as
it
’s
due
next
week
,
but
as
I
’ve
been
working
on
it
for
a
while
I
’m
just
concerned
I
’m
not
actually
doing
it
right
.
The
information
on
system
says
about
a
section
where
you
engage
with
the
piece
you
’re
commenting
on
,
but
I
do
n’t
know
how
specific
this
has
to
be
,
and
should
we
be
using
references
to
back
our
experiences
up
?
In
which
case
,
do
they
have
to
directly
comment
on
the
piece
too
,
as
the
references
throughout
should
,
or
can
they
be
more
general
to
the
idea
?
I
hope
this
makes
sense
.
Also
,
if
we
are
struggling
to
stay
within
the
word
count
,
which
section
do
you
think
should
be
the
most
important
;
the
strengths
and
limitations
of
the
methodology
or
the
personal
experiences
?
Thank
you
in
advance
for
your
help
,
.
Hello
,
I
have
found
some
information
regarding
your
Helsinki
trip
and
wanted
to
share
this
with
you
.
Firstly
,
I
understand
that
you
are
wanting
a
hotel
by
the
water
.
I
have
found
the
'
Hilton
Helsinki
Strand
'
which
I
hope
would
be
to
your
taste
.
It
is
located
right
by
the
sea
,
and
has
free
internet
.
It
is
rated
4.5
stars
on
TripAdvisor
and
is
within
walking
distance
to
the
city
center
.
The
furnishings
are
fairly
modern
.
For
your
breakfast
cafe
I
found
two
options
.
Firstly
,
there
is
the
'
Early
Bird
'
.
This
is
a
nine
minute
walk
from
the
hotel
mentioned
,
and
had
positive
reviews
.
Secondly
,
I
found
the
'
Ipi
Kulmakuppila
'
which
is
a
ten
minute
walk
from
the
hotel
mentioned
,
and
serves
pastries
,
whilst
also
offering
a
buffet
brunch
which
many
people
raved
about
within
reviews
.
A
good
museum
I
found
was
the
'
Helsinki
City
Museum
'
which
"
documents
and
displays
the
history
of
Helsinki
"
.
I
know
you
wanted
to
learn
about
the
city
's
history
,
so
thought
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
look
at
.
I
also
found
a
restaurant
that
serves
'
Poronkaristys
'
which
is
Helsinki
's
national
dish
.
The
restaurant
is
called
'
Lappi
Ravintola
'
and
has
4.5
stars
on
Google
Reviews
.
I
know
you
would
love
to
get
your
children
a
nice
souvenir
,
so
I
found
the
shop
'
Kankurin
Tupa
'
,
which
is
rated
4.3
on
Google
Reviews
.
It
has
a
lot
of
traditional
Helsinki
souvenirs
.
Just
so
you
are
aware
,
it
closes
at
6
pm
and
opens
at
10
am
.
Finally
,
I
thought
you
might
be
interested
in
the
live
music
of
Helsinki
which
I
know
you
enjoy
.
Two
top
rated
locations
are
'
G
LiveLab
'
which
is
a
bluesjazz
club
.
It
is
rated
number
nine
of
the
'
Concerts
and
Shows
of
Helsinki
'
on
TripAdvisor
.
It
has
great
reviews
;
4
stars
on
TripAdvisor
and
4.6
on
Google
Reviews
.
Another
option
is
'
Storyville
'
which
is
a
jazz
club
.
It
is
rated
4.1
on
Google
Reviews
,
and
one
reviewer
even
said
it
might
just
have
the
best
live
music
in
the
world
-
I
'll
let
you
be
the
judge
.
I
hope
this
information
was
helpful
to
you
,
and
I
hope
you
have
a
great
trip
.
Thank
you
,
Cassidy
think
so
now
,
just
trying
to
make
him
come
home
at
some
point
because
he
's
saying
he
wo
n't
x
I
know
,
he
's
not
really
listening
to
me
right
now
x

Hi
Edmund
,
Thank
you
for
that
,
that
’s
really
helpful

I

those
now

Hi
Fabio
,
I
was
just
wanting
to
submit
my
proposal
form
.
Although
I
am
at
the
beginning
of
my
ideas
,
I
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
hear
your
thoughts
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Ok
,
that
’s
great
.
Thank
you

Hi
Tiebout
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
After
receiving
my
essay
back
,
I
saw
you
had
commented
on
my
use
of
apostrophes
and
quotation
marks
.
I
had
used
apostrophes
to
portray
sarcasm
,
but
you
had
commented
that
I
had
used
them
wrong
,
and
should
pick
only
one
form
of
quotation
mark
.
Do
you
have
any
further
advice
on
how
to
portray
words
of
sarcasm
in
another
way
that
wo
n’t
be
mixed
up
with
quotations
?
It
would
be
greatly
appreciated
as
I
have
also
used
it
within
my
essay
due
next
week
and
do
n’t
want
to
be
doing
the
wrong
thing
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Hi
Prissie

That

Hi
Conney
,
Thank
you
so
much
,
that
really
does
help
.
I
’m
finding
the
word
count
very
hard
to
stick
to
at
the
moment
so
every
little
bit
helps
.
😂
Thank
you

Hi
Gianna
,
Sorry
to
bother
you
again
.
I
just
had
another
question
in
regards
to
the
assessment
.
I
have
heard
different
views
on
whether
or
not
footnotes
count
within
the
word
count
,
and
I
just
wanted
to
clear
it
up
.
I
have
heard
that
they
do
n’t
count
,
but
then
I
have
also
heard
they
do
count
unless
they
’re
used
for
references
?
If
you
have
any
information
on
this
it
would
be
great
as
I
’m
struggling
to
find
any
indication
on
this
module
handbook
and
all
of
my
other
modules
too
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Ardeen
,
Thank
you
for
that
!
Hope
you
have
a
good
rest
of
the
week
.
:)
Thanks

Hi
Solange
,
I
’m
so
sorry
I
just
realised
I
missed
the
seminar
at
3
today
.
I
am
currently
looking
after
my
younger
sister
for
the
week
and
time
completely
ran
away
with
me
.
I
have
completed
the
work
for
this
week
and
have
been
coding
the
interviews
for
the
assignment
,
I
just
wanted
to
check
that
there
was
n’t
any
important
information
I
missed
out
on
?
Again
,
I
am
really
sorry
for
missing
the
seminar
.
Thank
you
and
I
hope
you
are
well
,
.
Hi
,
I
was
writing
as
I
am
looking
for
some
information
as
to
what
to
do
for
my
abroad
placement
.
I
’m
feeling
quite
confused
about
everything
at
the
moment
and
just
needed
some
clarity
.
I
have
emailed
before
and
I
really
wanted
to
do
teaching
in
Iraq
for
my
placement
.
I
am
aware
in
the
current
climate
with
everything
going
on
this
is
likely
not
going
to
be
feasible
,
however
since
seeing
the
placement
seminar
today
,
I
have
seen
that
it
is
possible
to
do
study
abroad
for
a
term
and
then
placement
for
the
rest
of
the
time
.
When
I
go
onto
system
and
look
at
the
study
abroad
placements
I
see
that
all
of
them
seem
to
be
full
term
placements
?
.
How
would
you
go
about
applying
for
one
singular
term
and
then
placement
for
the
rest
,
and
would
your
placement
need
to
be
in
the
same
country
you
do
your
study
abroad
in
?
Another
of
my
queries
was
to
do
with
credits
,
as
I
have
seen
you
are
getting
assessed
whilst
on
the
study
abroad
programme
,
is
it
possible
to
understand
more
how
that
works
?
I
’m
sorry
for
the
amount
of
questions
,
I
just
suddenly
feel
like
I
should
have
done
a
lot
more
than
what
I
have
already
and
obviously
want
to
get
started
as
soon
as
possible
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Ok
,
I
will
see
as
I
have
to
collect
my
younger
sister
from
school
,
but
thank
you
!
Appreciate
the
help
,
.
I
was
just
wondering
if
I
could
get
some
information
on
footnotes
.
I
was
under
the
impression
that
footnotes
did
n’t
count
within
the
word
count
,
but
I
then
saw
online
that
they
do
count
if
they
’re
not
for
references
?
I
can
not
find
any
information
in
my
module
handbooks
,
so
was
just
looking
for
any
indication
.
Thank
you
in
advance
!
.
Hi
Janessa
,
That
’s
really
helpful
,
thank
you
!
That
makes
a
lot
more
sense
now
.
Appreciate
you
taking
the
time
to
explain
,
Kind
Regards
,
.
Hi
Ambur
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Sorry
to
bother
you
so
late
into
term
,
but
I
’m
just
struggling
a
bit
with
what
to
do
for
the
quantitative
analysis
part
of
the
assessment
.
The
results
section
says
to
‘
describe
comprehensively
’
but
I
do
n’t
know
whether
that
is
a
focus
on
the
findings
within
chi
-
square
tests
,
t
-
tests
etc
,
or
what
we
evaluate
from
the
chi
-
square
tests
.
or
would
these
need
to
be
split
into
two
different
table
categories
?
I
would
assume
they
would
need
to
be
split
,
but
as
they
come
from
one
output
I
did
n’t
know
if
they
would
be
able
to
be
grouped
together
to
make
it
easier
to
reference
within
text
.
Thank
you
,
and
sorry
again
for
all
the
questions
,
.
course
I
will
,
thank
you
,
have
a
good
weekend
too
xx
Thank
you
so
much
for
having
me
!
I
honestly
had
such
a
lovely
week
,
a
little
gift
was
the
least
I
could
do
after
all
you
have
done
for
me
!
Have
a
lovely
week
off
too
xx
Hehe
glad
you
like
them
xxx
Hopefully
these
sunflowers
keep
a
bit
better
than
the
ones
we
pickedxx
Aww
,
you
're
looking
after
them
then
;)
xx
Aw
very
impressed
;)
it
was
lovely
thank
you
!
Hope
your
week
off
has
been
great
too
xx
Aw
you
're
welcome
,
Happy
birthday
!
!
Hope
you
like
them
xx
haha
happy
to
supervise
;)
Mina
,
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
I
sadly
wo
n’t
be
able
to
make
it
to
the
seminar
on
Monday
.
I
just
thought
I
would
let
you
know
in
advance
.
If
there
is
any
important
information
I
need
to
know
,
I
’d
be
grateful
if
you
could
forward
me
this
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
I
have
previously
written
to
you
asking
if
there
was
any
chance
to
cancel
the
room
due
to
the
TP2
update
that
there
will
still
be
no
teaching
online
.
Now
that
we
are
in
a
lockdown
again
for
the
foreseeable
,
and
after
last
year
being
able
to
cancel
your
accommodation
as
a
result
of
this
,
I
wanted
to
ask
if
anything
had
changed
.
Money
and
mental
health
are
two
massive
issues
in
my
life
right
now
,
and
being
able
to
cancel
my
accommodation
would
be
incredibly
helpful
.
I
have
been
in
the
room
for
4
days
since
the
start
of
term
,
and
this
room
could
be
put
to
so
much
better
use
by
another
tenant
as
I
am
likely
not
going
to
come
back
to
university
this
year
due
to
the
current
conditions
.
Moreover
,
should
I
use
my
room
,
I
would
be
coming
from
a
low
risk
area
into
a
high
risk
,
and
due
to
having
to
be
at
home
due
to
my
care
rule
for
a
family
member
,
this
would
be
highly
dangerous
for
myself
and
others
.
I
understand
that
your
protocol
is
n’t
to
let
people
just
come
out
of
tenancy
,
but
is
there
any
way
there
could
be
an
exception
under
the
current
circumstances
of
the
world
;
this
is
n’t
exactly
a
normal
year
.
Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.

Hi
Maddi
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
just
wanted
to
ask
a
question
about
the
assessment
for
the
module
.
I
saw
that
you
are
meant
to
put
your
text
as
an
appendix
.
I
was
hoping
to
look
at
mind
style
within
‘
book
’
,
does
this
mean
I
should
pick
only
a
chaptersection
to
analyse
and
then
put
this
in
the
appendix
?
Just
wanted
to
clarify
so
I
can
get
my
ideas
together
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Hi
,
I
’m
meant
to
be
having
a
meeting
at
2:20
today
and
I
still
have
n’t
received
a
link
for
the
meeting
?
I
just
wanted
to
make
sure
it
was
still
going
ahead
.
Thank
you
,
.
I
recently
received
a
job
description
from
one
of
my
lecturers
,
and
was
wondering
if
I
could
gain
a
little
bit
more
information
on
what
exactly
this
would
entail
.
I
currently
have
another
job
,
and
am
helping
my
younger
sister
with
her
online
schooling
as
well
as
my
university
work
,
but
I
am
really
eager
to
improve
my
CV
and
gain
some
wider
experience
.
Therefore
,
I
was
just
hoping
to
learn
some
more
about
the
task
at
hand
in
order
to
see
if
it
is
something
I
will
be
able
to
successfully
achieve
.
My
main
queries
were
surrounding
what
the
actual
task
of
the
job
was
,
how
many
hours
per
week
would
be
needed
and
for
how
many
weeks
the
job
would
run
,
as
well
as
pay
if
possible
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Hi
Leta
,
I
was
just
writing
to
enquire
about
the
written
assignment
for
3887
.
I
was
wondering
whether
or
not
the
theorycriticism
had
to
directly
comment
on
the
text
we
are
using
,
or
more
so
just
the
ideology
it
discusses
.
I
ask
as
the
more
contemporary
options
eg
.
the
podcast
do
not
have
as
much
commentary
on
them
,
and
therefore
if
this
would
be
an
issue
with
marking
etc
I
would
maybe
look
at
different
options
.
I
also
did
realise
,
in
the
past
when
I
’ve
emailed
I
’ve
spelt
your
name
wrong
,
so
my
apologies
for
that
!
Thank
you
in
advance
for
your
help
,
.
Hi
Tirrell
,
I
was
just
writing
to
enquire
as
to
how
you
think
paragraphs
should
be
laid
out
.
Prior
to
this
week
I
was
under
the
impression
that
a
paragraph
should
discuss
one
point
,
but
I
always
end
up
having
extremely
long
paragraphs
taking
up
almost
a
page
.
I
was
then
told
that
within
a
paragraph
you
should
have
indents
to
raise
a
new
point
,
but
still
continue
in
the
same
argument
.
This
is
n’t
something
I
’ve
ever
done
,
so
I
do
n’t
really
have
any
knowledge
on
how
properly
to
lay
this
out
.
At
the
moment
,
I
have
one
argument
as
a
paragraph
,
but
with
indents
within
the
paragraph
to
indicate
new
ideas
.
If
there
’s
any
information
you
could
give
to
point
me
in
the
right
direction
,
that
would
be
greatly
appreciated
!
Thank
you
in
advance
for
your
help
,
.

thinking
,
the
irony
of
human
thinking
,
I
’m
not
even
sure
what
we
have
to
do
entirely
haha
but
yh
just
a
thought
.
Hope
you
’re
all
well
and
safe
:)
I
’ve
uploaded
the
questions
we
discussed
in
the
Snapchat
from
the
people
that
sent
theirs
.
It
’s
under
group
if
anyone
else
wants
to
add
to
it
:)
Yh
,
for
sure
,
a
lot
easier
than
talking
on
here
😂
Hi
,
Yh
I
agree
.
These
were
some
of
my
thoughts
.
Definitely
need
to
link
more
to
ideology
but
yh
just
some
thoughts
Hi
Brenna
,
That
’s
great
.
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
and
quick
reply
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
,
I
am
writing
as
I
received
an
email
on
DD.MM.YYYY
saying
that
I
was
eligible
for
a
£
50
scholarship
payment
.
I
filled
in
my
card
details
that
day
,
but
I
just
wanted
to
check
that
this
was
a
legit
email
as
I
did
n’t
receive
the
payment
and
have
been
having
issues
with
people
trying
to
hack
my
accounts
.
I
understand
that
if
this
was
a
legit
email
it
might
just
be
taking
time
,
and
if
that
s
the
case
I
do
apologise
for
taking
up
your
time
!
Any
information
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Hi
Gabriello
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
aware
that
this
may
be
a
bit
premature
as
we
are
only
in
the
first
week
,
but
as
I
have
a
few
essays
due
in
the
same
week
as
the
first
500
word
essay
for
this
module
I
just
wanted
to
get
things
ready
.
I
understand
that
we
can
use
a
text
from
the
further
reading
section
on
system
,
and
I
was
looking
at
the
book
‘
Judith
Butler
:
sexual
politics
,
social
change
and
the
power
of
the
performative
’
by
Gill
Jagger
.
I
was
just
unsure
as
to
whether
this
would
be
a
good
text
to
look
at
as
it
is
someone
else
’s
comments
on
Butler
’s
work
,
and
therefore
in
the
section
of
the
essay
regarding
the
authors
main
arguments
,
would
this
be
confusing
as
the
author
is
arguing
Butler
’s
points
?
I
apologise
if
I
am
reading
too
much
into
this
.
Thank
you
in
advance
for
your
help
,
.
Carmelina
,
I
saw
the
email
about
research
participants
needed
and
was
just
wondering
if
you
could
give
some
more
information
?
I
am
interested
in
being
involved
,
but
just
want
to
know
what
it
’s
all
about
first
,
if
that
’s
ok
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
back
from
you
.
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Zora
,
I
have
attached
our
groups
summary
for
this
well
on
film
.
Hopefully
it
has
sent
correctly
,
but
if
not
let
me
know
and
I
’ll
try
to
send
it
again
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
Sheena
,
I
would
love
to
be
a
part
of
your
research
.
I
have
attached
my
consent
form
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
back
from
you
.
Best
wishes
,
.
I
’m
not
too
sure
.
I
’ll
have
a
look
and
if
not
I
’ll
just
try
to
find
it
elsewhere
.
Thanks
,
.
No
sorry
,
on
system
in
the
handbook
it
says
:
copied_text
I
could
n’t
find
anything
on
these
texts
anywhere
-
is
this
still
what
we
’re
meant
to
be
doing
?
I
have
watched
the
Tuhiwai
-
Smith
video
also
,
but
is
there
a
text
that
needs
reading
for
her
also
?
So
sorry
for
all
the
questions
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Ajai
,
So
sorry
to
bother
you
again
.
I
’m
struggling
to
find
the
readings
for
this
week
;
the
handbook
says
they
’re
on
talis
but
I
ca
n’t
find
them
there
,
nor
can
I
find
them
on
system
.
Again
my
apologies
for
bothering
you
again
,
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
No
worries
,
thank
you
!

Morning
Hamilton
,
I
was
just
looking
at
the
lecture
for
this
week
,
which
I
believed
to
be
Ferd
,
but
there
seems
to
be
a
confusion
with
the
weekstopics
?
In
the
Learning
and
Teaching
Activities
folder
,
the
weeks
go
from
17
to
19
,
but
within
19
there
is
a
week
18
lecture
.
However
,
the
week
18
lecture
refers
to
the
topics
of
week
19
.
.
I
have
tried
to
add
some
images
.
If
this
week
has
just
switched
round
,
my
apologies
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Clair
,
Yes
that
’s
great
,
thank
you
for
your
help
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
Georgie
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Sorry
to
contact
you
so
late
into
term
,
I
was
just
needing
some
help
with
the
qualitative
side
of
the
assessment
.
The
brief
says
to
provide
a
‘
description
of
main
themes
’
,
so
I
was
wondering
are
you
looking
to
have
a
description
through
what
is
said
within
the
data
,
I
do
n’t
see
how
it
would
be
reasonable
to
force
students
to
pay
for
a
room
they
can
not
even
inhabit
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
I
look
forward
to
hearing
your
response
.
.
Torrie
,
Yes
it
is
great
is
n’t
it
!
Thank
you
so
much
for
those
resources
,
that
’s
really
helpful
and
I
’m
sure
it
was
n’t
quick
to
find
so
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
!
I
really
appreciate
it
.
I
have
an
idea
of
where
I
want
my
essay
to
go
,
but
these
will
really
help
develop
that
so
thank
you
!
Kind
Regards
,
.
No
worries
at
all
!
:)
Hi
,
Brilliant
;
it
’s
all
working
now
,
thank
you
!
.
Hi
Joan
,
No
worries
!
It
still
is
n't
working
;
just
saying
the
same
thing
that
I
need
to
request
access
,
but
I
will
keep
trying
throughout
the
day
and
I
'm
sure
it
will
eventually
work
.
Thank
you
for
your
help
,
.
Hi
Vale
,
Just
so
you
know
,
the
lecture
videos
are
doing
the
‘
request
access
’
thing
again
that
happened
in
the
first
week
.
I
’ve
added
a
photo
to
show
you
what
it
looks
like
.
Weirdly
enough
,
the
third
video
does
n’t
have
it
,
but
the
other
two
do
?
Just
thought
I
’d
let
you
know
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Rutter
,
I
hope
you
're
well
.
Please
find
attached
my
alumni
interview
piece
.
I
would
really
appreciate
,
if
possible
,
getting
some
information
on
the
job
description
including
hours
etc
.
,
just
so
that
I
can
decipher
whether
I
can
give
the
role
the
time
that
it
deserves
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
,
.
Hi
,
Thank
you
,
that
would
be
great
.
I
will
book
for
tomorrow
at
1
if
that
’s
ok
?
I
’ve
never
actually
used
system
so
I
’m
not
too
sure
what
happens
with
that
,
but
sure
I
can
figure
it
out
.
Thanks
for
the
help
,
.
Hi
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
After
receiving
my
essay
back
I
was
quite
unsure
as
to
how
I
had
gone
so
wrong
,
and
further
to
your
comments
,
I
would
really
appreciate
your
support
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
give
me
some
clarity
as
to
how
I
failed
to
use
and
analyse
metaphor
within
my
essay
,
as
the
parts
where
this
was
stated
I
believed
I
had
done
what
I
had
to
do
.
Moreover
,
the
paragraphs
subsequent
to
those
commented
on
had
no
praiseconfirmation
that
they
were
ok
,
therefore
I
am
struggling
to
make
sense
of
what
I
need
to
do
in
the
future
.
To
give
examples
,
my
first
analysis
paragraph
was
a
close
analysis
of
the
first
two
lines
of
the
poem
.
I
analysed
death
metaphors
using
theory
.
However
,
there
was
a
comment
that
these
points
were
‘
valid
but
not
grounded
in
an
analysis
of
metaphor
’
.
I
understand
that
the
close
analysis
discusses
emotions
and
negation
,
but
I
was
analysing
what
these
feelings
actually
meant
.
This
comment
was
also
used
further
in
my
analysis
.
I
understand
that
you
are
arguing
my
word
choices
are
not
valid
metaphors
,
however
I
analysed
the
ideologies
presented
within
the
poem
as
a
result
of
their
metaphorical
meaning
,
and
had
this
poem
not
have
been
a
good
source
for
metaphor
analysis
,
I
would
have
appreciated
that
to
have
been
pointed
out
when
I
had
confirmation
on
my
essay
choice
.
Moreover
,
there
was
a
comment
on
my
relation
of
heat
and
passion
saying
‘
where
?
’
But
the
sentence
highlights
that
I
’m
saying
that
is
the
usual
assumption
,
but
the
poem
negates
that
feeling
.
There
was
also
a
criticism
within
my
literature
review
that
one
of
my
references
made
the
same
points
as
an
earlier
reference
,
but
I
state
that
this
person
is
following
on
from
their
ideas
explicitly
.
I
was
really
disappointed
with
my
mark
and
want
to
ensure
that
I
do
n’t
make
the
same
mistakes
in
the
future
,
so
I
would
really
appreciate
some
feedback
as
I
worked
incredibly
hard
on
this
piece
.
Thank
you
.
t
’s
great
,
thank
you
!
King

Hi
Patrica
,
This
is
.
from
the
module
module
.
I
was
just
wondering
,
are
both
the
webinar
and
seminar
compulsory
?
Or
is
it
the
same
information
being
taught
in
both
session
and
therefore
one
or
the
other
?
Thank
you
,
hope
you
’re
well
!

Hello
,
Since
receiving
the
recent
TP2
update
that
there
will
actually
be
no
changes
to
teaching
after
Christmas
,
I
was
wondering
if
there
will
now
be
an
opportunity
to
cancel
accommodation
.
When
the
students
were
booking
accommodation
,
we
were
under
the
impression
that
after
Christmas
we
would
be
going
back
to
being
in
university
physically
,
and
therefore
we
had
no
obligation
to
cancel
or
postpone
our
payments
-
due
to
the
recent
change
,
are
there
going
to
be
any
opportunities
for
this
,
as
it
would
be
preferable
not
to
be
paying
over
£
6000
for
an
unneeded
room
?
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
I
was
writing
to
enquire
about
possible
cancellation
of
my
room
due
to
the
new
updates
with
TP2
that
there
will
still
be
no
in
person
contact
on
campus
.
I
,
as
many
others
,
booked
accommodation
under
the
idea
that
there
would
be
a
need
to
be
coming
in
every
week
,
but
since
the
university
are
having
seminars
and
lectures
online
,
and
have
confirmed
that
this
wo
n’t
change
in
September
as
they
first
believed
it
would
,
it
would
be
really
beneficial
to
me
to
be
able
to
not
pay
for
a
room
I
no
longer
use
.
Due
to
the
continued
increase
of
cases
within
San
Jose
,
I
am
currently
back
at
home
,
therefore
the
room
is
not
being
used
but
being
paid
for
.
I
understand
that
there
is
a
contract
,
but
I
would
really
appreciate
any
help
that
could
be
given
within
the
current
circumstances
.
I
understand
that
no
one
was
to
know
what
would
go
on
,
and
that
is
why
I
booked
the
room
in
the
first
place
.
Even
if
the
full
cancellation
is
n’t
possible
yet
,
would
there
be
any
chance
that
this
would
be
possible
in
the
future
?
Maybe
after
Christmas
or
in
the
final
term
as
was
done
at
the
end
of
last
year
?
I
really
appreciate
any
help
,
and
thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Brenn
,
I
was
just
wondering
if
there
is
still
a
webinar
this
morning
as
there
is
no
link
to
it
in
system
for
me
?
It
says
there
are
no
scheduled
sessions
.
I
did
n’t
know
if
this
was
an
issue
with
my
system
,
or
if
there
’s
just
no
session
today
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
!
My
name
is
.
,
and
I
was
just
wanting
some
more
information
in
regards
to
teaching
abroad
.
I
have
seen
the
PDF
on
system
about
teaching
abroad
,
however
all
of
the
links
I
have
tried
to
use
do
n’t
seem
to
be
working
for
me
.
I
particularly
wanted
to
gain
some
information
on
teaching
in
America
,
as
this
is
the
only
thing
I
’ve
ever
wanted
to
do
with
my
placement
year
.
I
know
that
with
COVID
this
could
be
an
issue
,
but
I
’m
hoping
that
this
will
still
be
able
to
go
ahead
,
particularly
as
we
still
have
a
year
to
be
optimistic
about
.
Any
information
in
regards
to
gaining
access
to
the
companies
that
would
deal
with
teaching
in
Britain
,
or
any
information
really
would
be
greatly
appreciated
!
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Hi
Sheeree
,
That
was
really
helpful
,
thank
you
so
much
for
all
of
that
!
I
will
have
a
look
into
those
different
avenues
,
Thanks
again
,
.
:)
Hi
,
Sorry
yes
I
have
just
reread
the
email
from
IT
and
the
code
is
within
that
.
Sorry
to
bother
you
!
Thank
you

Hi
Hartley
,
I
was
just
wondering
,
when
I
go
onto
NVivo
it
says
I
need
a
12
license
key
?
Do
you
know
what
this
is
,
or
if
you
think
I
’ve
downloaded
it
wrong
?
Thank
you
,
.
I
found
it
.
Thanks
!
Sorry
to
bother
you
.
.
Morning
Conchita
,
Hope
you
’re
well
!
I
was
just
emailing
as
I
can
not
seem
to
find
the
second
prereading
for
the
seminar
on
system
?
I
do
n’t
know
if
this
is
an
issue
on
my
behalf
or
an
issue
with
system
?
It
is
the
:
copied_text
.
If
I
type
in
the
name
of
the
author
or
the
paper
it
does
n’t
seem
to
come
up
.
Just
thought
I
’d
let
you
know
incase
it
’s
a
wider
issue
than
just
mine
.
Thank
you
,
.
Rayner
That
’s
great
,
thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
!
Have
a
great
rest
of
the
day
Kind

Hi
Guglielma
,
That
’s
great
,
thank
you
very
much
!
I
did
think
the
same
about
the
number
of
reviews
,
so
thank
you
for
confirming
that
.
Have
a
good
day
,
.
Hi
Marchelle
,
I
just
thought
I
’d
let
you
know
that
I
have
submitted
my
ethics
form
,
so
if
you
have
a
second
to
look
over
it
that
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
I
sent
this
email
almost
2
weeks
ago
and
never
got
a
reply
.
I
understand
that
you
must
be
insanely
busy
at
this
time
,
but
I
would
really
appreciate
some
indication
into
the
possibility
of
me
being
able
to
cancel
my
accommodation
.
My
situation
is
only
getting
worse
and
I
would
really
appreciate
being
able
to
have
this
conversation
with
someone
on
your
team
before
the
next
payment
has
to
come
out
.
Thank
you
again
in
advance
,
.
Hi
Pincus
,
I
just
wanted
to
ask
a
quick
question
in
relation
to
my
research
project
.
Within
my
subject
research
project
,
I
am
using
NVivo
to
analyse
some
qualitative
data
.
I
thought
this
could
be
useful
for
analysing
my
reviews
also
,
as
I
can
find
common
themes
within
each
of
my
reviews
.
Is
this
something
that
is
used
within
subject
research
and
therefore
is
good
to
mention
in
my
methodology
,
or
should
I
just
stick
to
more
manual
forms
of
analysis
?
I
guess
I
could
also
use
NVivo
for
my
own
knowledge
,
but
it
does
n’t
necessarily
need
to
be
part
of
my
essay
?
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.
Hi
Samaria
,
That
’s
great
thank
you
!
Yes
I
thought
the
same
;
makes
it
so
much
easier
to
make
references
across
each
source
.
Thanks
,
.
Oh
ok
,
no
worries
!
I
’m
sure
everything
is
fine
,
but
will
do
.
Thank
you
!

Hi
Chadd
,
I
was
just
watching
and
following
along
with
your
lecture
,
and
when
I
go
to
Analyze
>
Compare
Means
>
Summary
Independent
Samples
T
-
Test
,
as
you
say
,
it
brings
up
this
page
as
opposed
to
the
page
outlined
within
your
lecture
.
I
did
n't
know
if
this
is
something
I
'm
doing
wrong
,
or
something
wrong
with
my
SPSS
.
But
any
help
would
be
appreciated
!
Sorry
to
bother
you
,
and
if
you
're
busy
,
I
can
bring
it
up
in
the
seminar
tomorrow
.
Thank
you
,
.
a
,
I
do
try
;)
.
Thank
you
,
Vicki
,
that
is
very
helpful
.
Thanks
again
for
the
help
,
and
my
apologises
for
all
the
emails
!
.
Hi
Bell
,
Sorry
to
bother
you
again
on
this
topic
.
After
your
message
I
looked
at
Christina
Scharff
’s
‘
Repudiating
Feminism
’
,
looking
at
one
chapter
in
particular
.
I
assume
from
the
essay
specification
that
you
want
us
to
look
at
one
chapter
specifically
?
.
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Eddi
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
just
had
a
question
about
the
essay
.
I
was
looking
to
do
the
essay
on
‘
tv_show
’
the
Netflix
show
,
as
after
assessing
the
extra
texts
,
this
is
a
show
I
am
very
familiar
with
and
enjoyed
a
lot
.
However
,
I
’m
slightly
confused
as
whenever
I
am
looking
up
the
sub
genres
of
crime
fiction
,
they
always
seem
to
focus
around
the
detective
as
a
means
to
decipher
the
sun
genre
,
whereas
this
piece
does
n’t
have
that
layout
necessarily
.
I
did
n’t
know
whether
there
was
any
first
-
person
theory
so
to
speak
that
you
were
aware
of
and
could
give
me
some
advice
on
,
because
as
of
yet
I
am
struggling
to
find
relevant
theories
.
I
know
this
is
a
bit
different
to
the
usual
types
,
but
I
do
feel
as
though
there
could
be
a
really
interesting
analysis
of
the
text
to
be
had
should
I
find
some
good
enough
references
.
Thank
you
in
advance
,
.

at
Aston

to
reach
our
precise
objective
.
Advertising
and
sales
promotion
have
been
decided
as
the
two
main
tools
because
of
brand
awareness
it
will
provide
the
up
and
coming
brand
.
Advertising
is
informing

reminding

the

a
form
of
mass

to
sales
promotion
goals
to

.
Considering
the
timeframe
and
the
main
aim
to
build

these
tools
provide

Dear
CEO
,
I
hope
all
is
well
.
I
have
conducted
some
research
for
your
trip
to
Helsinki
and
was
quite
an
enjoyable
experience
doing
so
!
I
took
into
account
your
special
itinerary
items
for
the
trip
and
will
share
them
now
.
For
the
central
hotel
near
the
water
was
a
very
popular
dish
but
felt
it
would
be
an
opportunity
for
you
to
go
with
your
tastes
on
the
day
and
ask
locals
the
best
places
for
these
dishes
to
get
the
most
authentic
tastes
.
A
shop
to
buy
souvenirs
for
children
:
Kankum
Tupa
,
Roobetin
Herkku
or
the
Pien
Shop
are
three
very
popular
gift
shops
which
could
have
a
variety
for
children
.
For
the
evening
:
On
the
rocks
Kallio
or
G
live
lab
are
two
very
popular
music
live
venues
with
a
variety
.
Thank
you
for
letting
me
research
this
and
please
let
me
know
if
there
are
more
specific
needs
you
require
which
I
will
be
happy
to
work
on
as
soon
as
.
Best
wishes

Balraj
Sorry
for
the
late
been
so
busy
today
Where
did
you
hear
about
the
case
?
I
m
scared
now
😭
😭
Thank
you

it
okay

just
headache
this
whole
thing
The
world
is
mas
I
mwan
I
can
send
you
a
plan
but
that
’s
more
tailored
to
me
due
to
the
condition
I
have
Or
come
gym
with
me
It
depends
what
goal
you
have
for
gym
That
’s
it
absolutely
and
I
think
just
thinking
of
it
like
If
you
do
n’t
do
it
no
one
else
will
That
’s
how
I
think
about
it
When
you
acc
start
doing
it
you
feel
so
much
better
but
it
’s
so
annoying
in
the
first
month
Ralph

hope
you

Hi
all
,
I
hope
all
is
well
with
yourself
and
loved

It
may
be
a
good
option
to
not
do
the
event
as
I
am
unsure
if
the
engagement
will
be
there
from
students
in
this
current
period
whereas
the
event
seems
a
lot
more
promising
.

has
been
by
the
organisation

how

this
be

do
not
want

last

Hi
Hewet
,
On
my
JPEG
image
,
it
is
coming
up
blurry
when
uploading
to
the
system
webpage
and
do
not
want
it
to
come
up
unclear
.
Is
there
a
way
I
can
sort
this
?
Hi
,
I
am
being
asked
to
come
on
as
a
personal
note
and
will
not
talk
about
event
or
as
job_title
and
i
have
been
on
before
as
job_title
but
will
tell
thme
not
to
mention
.
this
will
be
on
from
10:30am
Just
a
very
quick
one
,
I
have
had
a
call
from
organisation
to
come
on
and
talk
about
mental
health
,
I
will
not
discuss
the
event
on
there
and
be
endorsed
as
job_title
,
I
have
sent
this
to
organisation
,
just
wanted
to
get
you
quick
view
on
this
.
Also
just
a
quick
question
,
I
was
just
wondering
that
I
have
been
trying
to
contact
the
society
but
had
no
responses
and
have
heard
other
individuals
are
in
there
but
I
am
unsure
who
of
,
as
I
can
not
get
in
there
,
would
this
not
be
unfair
?
Kind

,

disabled
students
allowance

PIP

I
was
talking

Ondrea

and
was
recommending
all
these
things
and
I
remember
you
saying
to
me
a
lot
about
the
DSA
allowance
.
I
was
wondering
when
I
could
start
up
with
this
and
my
apologies
for
being
so
slow
with
it
.
I
always
appreciate
your
support
so
much
and

Hi
Adriaens
,
I
hope
all
is
well
with
you
and
your
loved
ones

I
was
wondering
when
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
have
help
with
my
CV
we
can
not
seem
to
ever
get
an
appointment
and
as
I
am
on
furlough
one
day
of
the
week
,
I
really
want
to
build
on
my
documents
considering
everything
I
have
already
done
at
the
organisation
so
far
.
Thank
you
Kind
Regards

always
trust

okay

Hi
,
I
hope
all
is
well
.
I
was
just
wondering
why
I
was
not
eligible
for
the
scholarship
in
my
second
year
and
what
the
stance
is
on
placement
year
.
Financially
it
would
help
so
much
especially
in
this
current
climate
as
otherwise
it
feels
like
as
if
I
just
worked
for
the
scholarship
to
hardly
receive
any
support
.
I
know
some
students
that
do
international
placements
have
had
their
fee
not
to
be
paid
for
as
a
support
so
I
am
just
in
a
confused
mind
.
Apologies
I
have
not
meant
to
sound
so
patronising
I
am
just
wishing
to
understand
more
the
reasoning
behind
.
Kind

I
realised
I
have
n't
come
to
a
conclusion
i.e.
a
definite
yes
or
no
to
the
question

Is
that
necessary
to
put
in
as
I
personally
think
it
will
be
helpful
and
ensures
the
question
is
answered
,
however
there
is
the
element
of
leaving
it
open
for
thought

assuming

am
going

be
presenting
to

Ethical
Issues
There
are
many
ethical
principles
regarding
the
use
of
online
surveys
,
the
most
important
one
being
informed
consent
–
participants
within
reason
know
what
they
are
going
to
be
doing
.
In
addition
,
participation
should
be
voluntary
and
anonymous
.
Questions
should
also
avoid
physical
and
psychological
harm
to
the
participants
.
All
measures
have
been
taken
to
ensure
ethical
principles
have
been
followed
.
For
example
,
informed
consent
will
happen
when
customers
arrive
for
their
appointment
.
They
will
be
asked
whether
they
would
like
to
partake
in
an
online
survey
.
If
answered
yes
,
only
then
will
an

containing
the
survey
be

I
've
just
received
my
assessment
results
and
just
wanted
to
know
why
I
got
a
low
grade
for
my
coursework
even
though
I
did
the
extra
reading
and
had
edited
and
improved
everything
you
told
me
to
.
I
'm
a
bit
disappointed
as
I
had
put
in
so
much
effort
into
this
module
and
had
attended
all
the
lectures
and
seminars
too
.
Is
there
any
way
I
can
get
feedback
or
take
this
further
as
I
'm
not
happy
about
this
to
be
honest

Hi
Shelbi
,
We
did
address
that
not
all
members
were
contributing
the
same
amount
as
others
and
we
had
written
it
down
quite
a
few
times
on
several
pieces
of
work
that
we
submitted
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
this
was
taken
into
consideration
.
Please
could
you
confirm
this
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Gerard
,
Thank
you
for
your
e
-
mail
and
for
clarifying
this
.
However
,
I
feel
like
the
point
of
the
peer
assessment
was
not
only
to
give
improvement
suggestions
but
it
also
highlighted
the
ratings
given
for
each
individual
.
I
scored
some
of
the
students
with
low
marks
as
they
did
n't
even
bother
showing
up
to
meetings
and
seminars
and
decided
that
their
lunch
time
was
more
important
than
this
module
.
Surely
this
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
too
.
How
can
someone
who
does
n't
turn
up
to
lessons
and
group
meetings
outside
of
uni
times
still
score
higher
than
others
?
If
that
were
the
case
then
all
of
us
could
've
not
met
up
at
all
and
just
written
whatever
we
felt
like
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
that
makes
sense
.

,

Hi
Agnella
,
I
just
wanted
to
enquire
about
why
my
mark
for
the
individual
assignment
was
so
low
in
comparison
to
others
in
the
group
?
I
would
like
feedback
on
this
since
we
all
discussed
as
a
group
what
to
write
so
the
content
was
the
same
even
though
the
wording
might
be
slightly
different
.
And
some
of
the
girls
in
the
group
had
n't
even
shown
up
to
meetings
and
seminars
yet
they
still
managed
to
get
higher
grades
than
some
of
us
.
Please
could
you
help
me
understand
this
as
I
'm
quite
confused
and
a
bit
disappointed
too
.
Especially
considering
the
effort
put
in
and
how
it
does
n't
reflect
in
the
mark
.

,
.
Laurene
,
Thank
you
for
your

this

not
able
to
upload
the
form
as
it
was
still
on
pending
so
I
e
-
mailed
one
of
the
placement
coordinators
and
sent
them
the
forms
and
they
said
they
uploaded
it
.
Where
would
I
upload
this
?
Would
it
be
under
placement
documentation
?
I
have
also
attached
it
incase
you
are
able
to
upload
it
.
Unfortunately
my
manager
could
only
sign
it
on
a
pdf
document
and
I
was
n't
able
to
edit
it
so
I
had
to
sign
in
on
a
different
document
hence
two
attachments
.
I
was
told
this
was
okay
though
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
,
Oh
okay
,
because
last
time
I
tried
uploadingamending
and
it
did
n't
allow
me
.
Nevertheless
,
thank
you
for
uploading
them
.
Yes
I
have
emailed
them
regarding
the
job
description
.
They
shall
send
that
soon
hopefully
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
,
Following
on
from
the
previous
e
-
mail
,
I
have
attached
the
job
description
within
this
e
-
mail
.
Please
let
me
know
if
this
will
suffice
or
if
there
is
anything
else
you
require
from
me
.
I
will
then
upload
it
onto
system
.
Thank
you

Hi
Charlie
,
The
person
in
charge
of
HR
is
Cosette
.
Her
e
-
mail
is
email_address
.
I
do
believe
she
only
works
part
time
so
this
may
be
the
reason
why
the
response
is
taking
a
while
.
However
,
I
can
also
provide
you
with
the
manager
's
contact
details
and
hopefully
he
gives
a
better
response
.
His
name
is
Demetri
.
His
e
-
mail
address
is
email_address
.
His
e
-
mail
response
is
n't
too
great
either
so
I
will
give
you
his
personal
mobile
number
if
that
is
okay
too
.
It
's
1111
.
Hope
this
helps
.
If
there
is
anything
else
you
need
from
me
please
let
me
know
.
Regards
,
.
Lela
,
Hope
you
are
keeping
well
.
I
wanted
to
ask
when
we
could
set
up
a
virtual
meeting
for
the
work
placement
I
have
completed
.
Also
,
I
would
like
to
know
more
about
the
procedures
as
they
are
a
bit
confusing
for
me
to
understand
so
wanted
clarification
.
When
could
we
schedule
a
meeting
?

Hi

Hi
Ruthanne
,
Hope
you
had
a
wonderful
holiday
.
So
,
my
main
questions
are
:
1
)
What
is
the
total
word
count
for
the
essay
My
placement
was
done
remotely
i.e.
I
did
not
go
into
the
office
.
Does
this
change
anything
for
any
of
the
requirements
of
the
assessment
?
Would
that
also
mean
I
fall
under
the
Flexible
and
Portfolio
Placement
SoM
Portfolio
?
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
Sherlock
,
I
have
completed
a
first
draft
of
the
questions
and
was
hoping
you
could
review
my
work
and
provide
feedback
on
improvements
that
need
to
be
made
and
on
anything
else
I
could
add
.
I
have
n't
put
in
the
images
for
the
appendix
as
yet
as
I
am
still
collecting
it
but
I
will
add
it
in
where
it
's
mentioned
.
Thank
you
,
.
Sorry
it
's
taken
so
long
to
email
you
my
work
.
Hope
this
helps

Hi
.
I
have
found
a
few
hotels
for
you
to
stay
at
for
your
conference
trip
in
September
.
I
have
tried
to
take
into
consideration
your
personal
preferences
and
have
managed
to
do
that
successfully
.
All
hotels
include
BandB
and
room
service
,
WiFi
,
gyms
,
pool
etc
.
They
are
also
situated
nearby
restaurants
have
traditional
foods
,
and
are
all
located
near
water
.
The
options
are
listed
below
.
Prices
are
for
2
nights
.
Trivago
:

Hotel
Helka
-
Â£169
,
1.1
miles
from
Helsinki
Central
-
Close
to
museum
-
Close
to
Finlandia
Hall
.
It
is
also
quite
likely
to
rain
so
it
would
be
advised
to
pack
warmer
clothes
and
an
umbrella
.
If
you
have
any
questions
,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
get
in
contact
with
me

Hi
,
I
do
not
appreciate
the
constant
emails
,
calls
and
messages
being
sent
.
It
feels
very
pressurising
and
forceful
.
As
I
mentioned
to
your
colleague
,
I
would
appreciate
if
you
can
take
me
off
your
mailing
,
call
and
message
list
.
If
I
go
ahead
with
the
booking
I
shall
complete
the
application

myself

Please
can
you
stop
spamming
me
in
the
meantime
.
Thank

Hi
,
As
I
stated
in
my
previous
email
I
would
like
you
to
remove
all
my
details
from
your
system
since
I
am
getting
way
too
many
emails
from
you
and
it
’s
getting
annoying
now
.
I
shall
sign
up
again
if
I
proceed
with
the
booking
.
Thanks
Regards
,

Hi
,
I
have
complained
several
times
regarding
the
continuous
spam
of
emails
from
yourselves
and
repeatedly
asked
to
remove
me
from
the
mailing
list
and
from
your
system
completely
.
This
has
still
not
been
done
and
I
am
getting
very
annoyed
now
.
Please
can
you
remove
me
from
your
system
completely
.
I
would
not
like
my
details
to
be
shared
with
yourselves
anymore
.

Hi
Sidney
,
Lovely
to
hear
from
you
.
I
’m
doing
well
thanks
how
are
you

Could
you
please
tell
me
more
about
it
?

Look

to
seeing
you
then

Hi
Cyril
,
Could
I
clarify
with
you
about
the
delivery
of
the
presentation
.
I
have
heard
from
many
tutors
that
we
can
do
an
audio
recording
of
our
presentation
-
a
video
is
not
needed
.
Could
I
confirm
this
please
?
Regards
,
.
Hi
Trixie
,
Yes
that
makes
sense
.
I
think
i
got
confused
because
i
did
n't
specify
whether
we
need
to
show
our
faces
or
not
.
Sorry
about
that
.
So
as
long
as
you
can
see
the
slides
and
we
are
talking
,
you
do
n't
need
to
see
our
faces
am
i
right
?
Sorry
that
's
what
i
was
referring
to
when
i
meant
video
recording
.
.
l
thanks
That
’s
fine
will
change
at
Penn
Station
I
finish
at
6
so
should
be
there
around
7

You
need
to
put
it
through

the

first
So
go
onto
JD

,
put
in

my

me
the

No
you
do
it
I
’m
not
doing

And

Marena
,
Thank
you
for
your
input
.
That
has
helped
me
a
lot
.
I
think
3
is
good
too
but
I
'm
not
sure
if
I
can
get
much
research
out
of
it
as
I
think
it
would
simply
be
me
asking
whether
or
not
the
company
would
like
to
expand
their
homestay
service
to
other
cities
rather
than
just
staying
in
San
Antonio
,
and
then
researching
the
pros
,
cons
and
competitors
.
Is
this
a
suitable
amount
of
research
or
do
you
reckon
I
need
more
?
Also
,
please
could
you
explain
what
you
mean
by
linking
it
to
university
courses
as
I
'm
not
sure
I
fully
understand
how
it
relates
.
Thanks

I

I
do
n't
have

Background
Information
Kenya
Airways
celebrated
43
years
of
operations
in
January
2020
.
However
,
according
to
passengers
who
have
recently
flown
with
Kenya
Airways
,
the
airline
is
performing
poorly
and
not
meeting
customer
expectations
.
Standards
have
decreased
and
the
quality
of
the
overall
experience
has
worsened
.
Based
on
the
quantitative
and
qualitative
data
gathered
,
this
is
evident
.
There
have
been
many
occurrences
of
lost
luggage
,
poor
customer
service
within
the
airport
and
on
the
aircraft
,
and
insufficient
in
-
flight
entertainment
.
This
report
will
address
these
complaints
using
the
quantitative
and
qualitative
data
collected
and
analysed
to
make
comparisons
with
and
provide
sufficient
recommendations
for
improvement
.
Quantitative
Research
Secondary
data

25
%
to

and

offered
with
every
meal
,
as
well
as
in
between
.
I
'm

whom
I
should
be

about
this
issue
so
I
'm

hopefully
you
are

me
through

me

I

Hi
Sterling
,
So
I
need
to
apply
for
student
finance
,
then
inform
you
that
I
will
use
the
money
from
the
scholarship
to
pay
for
my
tuition
fees
?
Is
the
uni
not
able
to
do
this
directly
without
using
student
finance
?
I
do
n't
want
to
have
to
take
out
a
loan
when
I
'm
already
receeving
it
from
yourselves
.
I
also
was
told
that
once
my
placement
was
approved
,
the
uni
would
do
an
assessment
for
eligibility
so
could
I
wait
until
November
before
I
apply
for
SFE
if
I
really
have
to
?
I
'm
still
a
bit
confused
about
the
process
so
I
do
apologise
if
I
repeat
questions
to
ones
you
may
have
already
answered
.

Just

I

let

I

completed
my

for
student
finance

Will
it
be
sent
to
the
uni
automatically
or
is
there
anything
else
I
need
to
do
first
?

my

Hi

I
did
not

Please

Hi
,
I
'm
a
bit
confused
about
this
e

since
I
have
not
put
in
a
deposit
for

this

I
am

I

be
refunded
soon
however
,
I
have
not

Please
could
you
clarify
what
is
going

For
the
third
time
,
I
am
NOT
moving
in
to

this

therefore
,
why
are
you
taking
a
deposit
from
me
?
I
was
supposed
to
be
refunded
and
I
received
an
e
-
mail
to
confirm
this
.
Please
could
you
refund
me
the
money
since
everything
has
been
transferred
to
you
as
you
said
.
Hi

,
Thank
you

already
working

I
appreciate
you
contacting
me
however

I

I
need
to
pay
the
tuition
fees
in
instalments
by
a
certain
date
.
However
,
I
have
n't
received
a
confirmation
saying
that
my
student
finance
has
been
approved
yet
.
Also
,
can
I
disregard
the
email
since
I
was
told
to
wait
until
November
for
an
assessment
,
or
would
I
have
to
pay
the
fee
by
DDMMYYYY
as
stated
in
the
invoice
?
I
'm
a
bit
confused
about
this
.
Regards
,

Quincy
,
Okay
that
makes
sense
now
.
I
will
certainly
use
that
.
Thank
you
.
You
mentioned
referencing
the
models
but
how
would
that
work
as
from
my
understanding
I
answer
the
questions
in
the
model
format
.
Please
let
me
know
if
this
is
wrong
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
Prince
,
Thank
you
for
the
feedback
.
Please
could
you
give
an
example
of
how
this
could
be
done
?
I
've
been
using
the
topic
framework
as
that
was
suggested
in
the
assignment
brief
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
this
is
similar
to
the
reflection
models
you
mentioned
Expanding
company
services
to
other
parts
of
the
UK
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
I
've
understood
the
presentation
element
correctly
but
from
my
understanding
of
it
from
reading
the
brief
,
this
is
what
I
have
picked
up
.
Please
let
me
know
if
any
of
these
topics
would
be
okay
.
I
'm
deciding
between
1
and
2
so
would
appreciate
your
opinion
on
which
you
think
would
be
best
and
maximise
my
research
opportunities
.
Thank
you
It
time

should
n’t
be
a
problem
2nd
cake

Sometimes

cheapest

But
the
prices

differ

You

Hi

I
just
wanted
to
get
an
update
on
how
long
it
will
take
for
my

my

I
was
told
it
can
take

wanted
to
know
how

Yes

is
frustrating
I

excruciating
😣
Took
some

Hi
Haskell
,
From
our
meeting
yesterday
,
I
have
conjured
up
my
methodology
.
It
is
a
little
long
and
was
wondering
if
everything
I
have
included
in
it
is
needed
as
I
want
to
be
concise
.
Please
have
a
read
and
let
me
know
what
you
think
.
Thanks
in
advance
.

Hi
Coleen
,
Happy
New
year
!
I
hope
you
had
a
nice
relaxed
holiday
break
!
I
just
wanted
to
enquire
if
with
the
10mins
,
we
could
go
over
by
like
1530
seconds
because
I
'm
finding
it
hard
to
cut
down
without
providing
the
audience
with
all
the
information
the
marking
scheme
requires
as
I
do
not
want
to
be
marked
down
for
not
including
something
.
Kind
regards
,

Hi
Torrence
,
Hope
all
is
well
.
I
have
a
query
on
the
period
two
timetable
.
I
am
not
sure
whether
if
it
is
finalised
but
on
my
timetable
it
says
that
I
have
module
and
module
of
which
I
only
chose
module
.
Is
this
an
error
on
the
system
as
I
did
not
choose
to
do
both
modules
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
your
reply
.
Kind
regards

Should
I

"
Hands
up
.
Do
n’t
Shoot
!
"
"
End
SARS
!
"
"
Go
Green
!
!
"
are
just
a
few
of
the
chant
slogans
many
protesters
all
over
the
world
use
.
The
ample
number
of
protests
traversing
disparate
time
zones
has
caught
the
attention
of
academics
,
critics
and
communities
worldwide
.
In
today
’s
society
,
we
are
witnessing
and
experiencing
is
an
upsurge
of
protest
.
Whether
that
is
in
America
,
Asia
,
Europe
or
Sub
-
Saharan
Africa
,
each
continent
is
living
in
an
‘
Age
of
Mass
Protest
’
.
It
is
right
to
suggest
that
there
have
been
recurring
themes
of
inequality
,
repression
and
unrest
partnered
with
many
failed
governments
and
politics
that
contribute
to
this
increase
.
The
frequency
,
scope
and
size
of
these
protests
are
considered
‘
mass
protests
’
that
have
essentially
captured
media
attention
,
such
as
those
in
Britain
,
Nigeria
and
North
America
.
Although
each
protest
has
a
unique
context
and
cause
,
the
common
grievances
overwhelmingly
draw
on
the
opinions
and
viewpoints
of
feeble
and
ineffectual
governance
,
nepotism
and
malfeasance
.
Thus
,
the
essay
will
delve
into
the
claim
that
indeed
,
we
are
living
in
an
‘
Age
of
Mass
Protest
’
by
analysing
the
root
causes
of
the
increase
in
global
protests
.
These
include
inequality
,
corruption
and
environmental
degradation
.
Social
media
will
also
be
used
to
show
how
fast
news
spread
which
potentially
could
be
the
reason
for
a
rise
in
mass
protests
.
In
addition
,
the
essay
will
assess
whether
grievance
theories
may
play
a
role
in
explaining
a
rise
in
mass
protests
by
exploring
the
views
of
erudite
scholars
and
academics
of
International
Relations
,
who
examine
the
impact
of
grievances
on
protest
behaviours
.
Firstly
,
for
us
to
understand
and
analyse
the
claim
,
the
term
‘
mass
protest
’
needs
to
be
defined
.
According
to
Karl
-
Dieter
Opp
.
This
is
exemplified
in
the
copious
number
of
environmental
protests
occurring
worldwide
-
Spain
,
the
Netherlands
,
New
Zealand
,
and
Sweden-
where
the
nation
’s
sensation
,
Greta
Thunberg
campaigns
for
ecological
change
.
To
summarise
,
the
XR
protests
have
resulted
in
an
uproar
of
protests
due
to
their
collective
action
and
deprivation
of
responsive
governments
.
The
grievances
felt
from
XR
protesters
portray
how
the
principles
and
values
they
place
highly
are
being
violated
.
Recently
,
mass
protests
have
become
numerous
and
geographically
widespread
.
Protests
have
become
an
escalated
global
trend
and
continue
to
play
a
role
in
shaping
the
political
landscape
and
determining
the
next
cultural
,
economic
,
and
social
decisions
.
With
many
notable
frustrations
around
the
world
currently
,
effective
social
media
platforms
have
proven
to
increase
the
spread
of
mass
protests
.
This
essay
has
attempted
to
critically
assess
the
common
causes
and
themes
that
arise
which
garners
a
reaction
and
then
essentially
a
protest
.
The
grievance
theory
discussed
has
provided
valid
reason
as
to
why
BLM
,
#
EndSars
and
XR
are
protesting
in
masses
.
Dear
Sir
Madam
,
Re
:
Industrial
Placement
I
am
writing
to
seek
a
placement
at
your
organisation
.
I
have
just
completed
my
second
year
of
my
university
degree
in
course
at
university
which
specialises
in
subject
.
These
are
some
of
the
modules
I
have
completed
:
module
,
module
,
module
,
module
,
module
,
module
,
module
and
module
.
My
third
year
requires
me
to
undergo
an
industrial
placement
to
develop
workplace
skills
and
make
connections
in
industry
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
I
am
offered
a
chance
to
develop
my
skills
in
the
workplace
and
make
some
connections
within
the
industry
.
This
placement
will
give
me
an
opportunity
to
set
my
studies
in
context
and
gain
valuable
professional
experience
.
I
will
like
to
build
valuable
business
acumen
by
learning
different
business
strategies
and
gain
an
understanding
of
how
a
company
or
industry
operates
.
I
have
an
interest
in
marketing
and
would
like
to
get
involved
in
projects
outside
of
my
comfort
zone
.
Thank
you
for
giving
me
this
opportunity
.
Yours
faithfully
,
.
Dear
Uncle
,
This
is
the
employer
handbook
that
my
university
sent
me
.
It
has
certain
guidelines
and
rules
the
employer
must
follow
whilst
the
student
is
on
placement
with
them
.
Take
a
look
please
.
Thank
you
so
much
in
advance
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Uncle
Milicent
,
Thank
you
so
much
.
I
do
not
mind
either
one
.
If
the
office
is
much
more
convenient
for
you
then
that
’s
okay
also
.
I
can
travel
to
you
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hello
Uncle
,
I
would
like
to
come
tomorrow
.
I
will
be
coming
in
the
morning
around
11:30
.
Ok
we
will
do
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Dear
Maren
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
having
me
yesterday
and
taking
some
time
out
of
your
schedule
to
talk
to
and
see
me
.
It
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
that
you
are
willing
to
help
me
and
offer
me
a
placement
in
your
company
.
If
I
looked
unconvinced
to
you
yesterday
,
it
was
not
that
I
seemed
uninterested
,
it
was
because
when
saying
the
job
I
would
be
doing
would
be
hard
,
I
was
just
very
nervous
and
scared
of
not
doing
the
best
that
is
required
of
me
.
I
really
do
want
to
excel
but
feel
that
I
may
fail
in
this
department
as
maths
is
not
really
my
strong
point
,
hence
why
trying
to
go
into
the
marketing
route
,
although
I
know
there
are
not
a
lot
of
prospects
in
this
field
.
However
,
I
am
willing
to
try
and
learn
new
things
as
I
believe
job_title
will
open
a
lot
of
doors
for
me
.
I
also
believe
that
you
and
Cecile
will
help
and
train
me
a
lot
which
definitely
reassured
me
.
Moreover
,
I
managed
to
talk
to
my
placement
coordinator
about
the
amount
of
hours
I
can
do
and
they
said
said
that
a
minimum
of
30
hours
is
required
.
Best
wishes
,
.
h
that
’s
perfect
,
I
can
give
you
guys
a
kitchen
tour
as
well
😘
Guys
since
we
barely
have
pics
,
come
looking
cute
tomorrow
so
we
can
take
pics
cheers
Make
up
I
think
Unless
you
want
to
wear
heels
in
the
pic
You
already
know
🥰
thank
you
It
was
at
the
bottom
😂
😂
😂
😂
I
was
disappointed
to
say
the
least
but
thankful
also
I
did
n’t
have
to
guess
who
it
could
have
potentially
been
by
the
way
I
even
need
to
get
my
cupcakes
And
the
girl
is
running
behind
schedule
Btw
I
’m
not
wearing
anything
ott
wait
I
guess
it
’s
because
you
did
n’t
have
any
exam
periods
right
?
Honestly
can
not
wait
for
all
of
us
to
finish
Oh
ssh
I
’m
tired
of
it
But
obvs
the
experience
has
been
beautiful
Just
leave
it
mate
That
’s
what
a
lot
of
people
did
tbh
It
’s
pretty
full
,
a
lot
of
people
stayed
over
Christmas
To
be
honest
with
you
,
I
have
n’t
made
any
plans
yet
Have
n’t
even
applied
to
one
grad
job
Some
were
but
most
are
actually
from
like
the
UK
You
’re
off
to
a
good
start
Fingers
crossed
for
the
results
🙏
🏿
True
but
I
do
n’t
wanna
be
there
for
too
long
I
’m
getting
bored
of
that
place
business
,
I
have
been
having
keloid
treatment
on
my
ear
with
this
company
for
a
while
,
I
was
sent
it
from
Dr
Darell
to
Dallas
and
have
ran
out
of
the
first
step
as
it
went
mouldy
and
was
wondering
if
I
could
be
sent
the
keloid
opener
step
again
has
essentially
how
their
political
leaders
have
responded
to
the
public
pressures
of
COVID-19
.
What
do
you
think
?
Let
me
know
your
thoughts

Dear
Emanuel
,
Hope
all
is
well
.
In
regards
to
the
research
poster
and
when
putting
a
title
,
would
it
just
be
the
social
movement
we
are
presentation
or
does
it
have
to
be
a
specific
question
?
For
example
:
I
am
going
to
present
the
topic
and
have
decided
to
include
a
research
question
of
'
assignment_title
'
Does
this
make
sense
?
I
am
getting
a
little
confused
on
how
to
engage
with
the
questions
you
provided
us
without
going
off
topic
and
answering
the
research
question
.
Also
,
when
presenting
the
poster
to
you
,
can
we
add
transitions
and
animations
as
if
it
were
a
slide
show
but
perhaps
put
the
transitions
on
a
piece
of
text
or
a
picture
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
a
response
.
Kind
regards

how
to

proposal

however
when

there
were
no

Could

help
me
out
there

Dear

Let

introduce
myself

I
am

,
I
am
a
final
year
course
student
who
is
currently
seeking
advice
,
research
tips
,
and
insights
on
my
topic-
assignment_title
.
You
were
recommended
by
my
dissertation
tutor
,
Giovanna
.
He
has
spoken
highly
of
you
and
briefed
me
on
the
literature
and
articles
you
have
written
on
Brazil
leadership
styles
and
more
.
Although
this
is
not
quite
Iraq
,
I
would
love
to
gain
an
insight
into
the
theoretical
aspects
of
leadership
styles
in
politics
and
how
personas
contribute
to
certain
leadership
styles
.
Are
there
any
books
or
articles
you
would
recommend
me
having
a
gander
at
?
Any
tips
for
dissertation
research
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
a
response
.
Kind

Hi

Hope

Just
a
quick
query
in
regards
to
the
referencing
style
of
our
essays
,
is
there
a
particular
one
you
want
us
to
use
?
I
have
stated
to
use
Harvard-
would
you
say
that
's
fine
or
is
APA
more
suitable
?
Thank
you
in

Dear

Could
you
please
check
the
structure
of
my
dissertation
and
let
me
know
if
it
all
makes
sense
and
relates
to
my
research
question
:
assignment_title
Also
,
a
question
regarding
the
literature
,
do
we
just
have
to
mention
the
8
-
10
scholars
briefly
and
how
it
relates
to
our
research
question
as
I
am
worried
about
how
this
will
fit
in
with
the
word
count
?

I
would
love
to
have
a
chat
with
you
about
this
final
year
which
I
have
found
to
be
quite
overwhelming
,
to
say
the
least
.
I
wanted
to
touch
on
a
few
things
,
i.e.
dissertation
,
my
engagement
university
,
how
to
manage
time
between
work
and
study
.
I
was
wondering
if
we
could
talk
on
Microsoft
teams
or
via
phone
as
I
am
not
available
on
Sundays
.
Looking
forward
to
your
response
back

Hi

Good
afternoon
Marjory
Hope
all
is
well
.
Should
the
poster
only
be
on
one
page
on
PowerPoint
or
can
we
spread
the
presentation
on
multiple
slides
?
As
I
am
struggling
to
put
all
my
information
on
one
slide
.
Kind

,
.
Hi
Brant
,
Thank
you
for
your
response
.
I
will
look
into
that
option
.
Also
,
sorry
to
be
a
pain
but
is
it
possible
to
read
a
little
bit
of
my
introduction
to
the
assignment
to
see
if
I
am
going
in
the
right
direction-
I
am
answering
question
one
.
Furthermore
,
does
this
essay
question
need
to
have
two
sides
to
the
argument
as
I
am
struggling
to
find
an
opposing
argument
?

Hi
Debi
,
Hope
all
is
well
.
Really
enjoyed
the
webinar
today
.
I
just
wanted
to
be
honest
with
you
regarding
the
submission
in
week
7
,
although
it
is
not
compulsory
,
I
really
do
want
to
take
the
opportunity
and
submit
something
as
I
would
love
feedbackforward
on
how
to
progress
.
However
,
I
have
been
finding
this
year
very
overwhelming
as
I
have
major
assessments
due
but
found
that
this
would
not
be
interesting
and
stimulating
enough
for
the
audience
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
you
could
provide
me
with
some
ideas
.
I
am
really
struggling
and
would
not
want
my
idea
to
suffer
a
bad
grade
.
Please
help
me
.
Looking
forward
to
hearing
your
response
.

Hello

Hi
Haleigh
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
this
well
detailed
email
.
I
now
understand
but
just
a
quick
question
regarding
the
placement
abroad
.
I
would
possibly
love
to
go
abroad
on
my
placement
but
in
terms
of
what
I
do
there
,
can
I
work
?
Or
only
with
abroad
,
I
have
to
go
to
another
university
there
.
I
hope
this
makes
sense
.
Kind

Hi
Quintus
,
Hope
all
is
well

Thank
you
for
the
books
and
resources
you
have
provided
me
.
It
is
greatly
appreciated
.
Regarding
the
comparison
on
the
developing
countries
I
would
like
to
compare
Britain
as
it
is
a
dim
democratic
country
however
I
am
struggling
to
find
an
opposing
country
.
I
know
you
mention
Britain
but
I
do
not
know
a
lot
about
that
country
.
And
since
this
dissertation
is
on
our
interests
I
feel
that
I
might
not
engage
very
well
with
this
country
and
perform
to
the
best
of
my
ability
.
I
have
tried
to
research
countries
that
may
be
authoritarian
in
Mexico
but
have
struggled
to
find
any
.
Could
you
please
give
me
some
suggestions
on
which
countries
are
perhaps
dictatorships
?
I
really
wanted
to
do
my
dissertation
on
Russia
in
comparison
with
the
UK
and
worried
that
it
is
,
yes
,
too
broad
.
However
I
did
a
lot
of
research
on
it
and
I
'm
still
quite
swayed
to
do
that
comparison
.
What
was
the
reason
for
not
doing
this
comparison
again
?
I
can
not
remember
exactly
what
you
said
in
the
first
dissertation
touch
point
only
vaguely
.
Please
can
you
advise
on
this
.
Kind
regards
,
.

Please

Hi
,
Just
one
question
,
is
there
any
fees
we
need
to
pay
once
we
get
there
,
such
as
city
tax
etc
.
We
are
from
San
Jose
and
are
flying
over
for
a
very
special
event
and
would
not
want
anything
to
ruin
this
so
we
do
not
want
to
be
hit
with
unwanted
charges
.
If
there
are
any
fees
,
could
you
let
us
know
if
the
amount
so
we
are
prepared
for
this
please
.
Please
get
back
to
me
.
Thank
you
Kind
regards
.

Please

form

Kind

Hi
Davida
,
Hope
all
is
well
.
I
tried
to
book
a
slot
but
I
see
that
all
slots
have
been
filled
.
I
'm
not
understanding
how
this
works
.
Is
it
a
mandatory
meeting
?
If
so
,
I
am
worried
that
if
I
do
not
get
a
slot
this
may
affect
my
performance
on
the
dissertation
.
Also
is
the
meeting
Online
or
in
person
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
a
response
.
Kind

.
Hi
Iggie
,
Hope
all
is
well
.
Unfortunately
due
to
unforeseen
circumstances
,
I
missed
the
webinar
at
9:30
.
I
was
wondering
if
it
was
recorded
at
all
so
I
can
listen
back
to
it
.
Or
if
not
what
were
some
of
the
more
general
questions
that
may
benefit
me
?
Sorry
for
any
inconvenience
caused
.
Best
wishes
.
Hi
Quentin
,
Thank
you
for
your
quick
reply
.
Sorry
to
be
a
pain
but
I
can
not
see
the
recorded
webinars
on
system
.
Could
you
please
guide
me
how
to
locate
them
?
Kind
regards
,
.
the
tables
have
turned
🤢
That
board
is
n’t
getting
thrown
away
anytime
soon
Honestly
I
need
to
do
exercise
again
Which
went
straighttttt
to
me
overdraft
🥺
More
money

us
all
next
year
😂
We
better
,
I
do
n’t
wanna
hear
any
excuses
when
the
time
comes
guys
😒
Actually
but
first
how
do
you
get
one
in
the
first
place
I
would
wait
for
his
call
still
but
if
he
does
n’t
I
’m
going
to
bed
,
if
he
calls
later
on
I
’ll
tell
him
that
he
was
meant
to
call
me
at
6
so
what
happened
I
was
also
gon
na
say
this
but
like
air
him
Not
happy
at
all
with
your
service
.
I
ordered
something
and
a
completely
different
item
came
.
This
is
ridiculous
.
This
is
my
first
time
ordering
from
you
guys
so
this
is
not
good
at
all
.
I
ordered
a
black
hoodie
and
a
sweatshirt
came
instead
.
I
am
not
impressed
.
I
would
like
a
refund
since
the
hoodie
I
ordered
is
now
out
of
stock
.
Please
respond
.
.
Hi
Bonnee
,
Once
I
send
the
item
and
it
reaches
you
,
will
I
have
to
pay
for
the
delivery
,
cause
this
is
n’t
my
fault
,
I
should
n’t
have
to
,
so
would
like
to
receive
the
full
refund
,
including
delivery
.
Kind
regards
.
Good
afternoon
business
,
I
’m
emailing
in
regards
to
my
wig
appointment
yesterday
at
12
,
it
was
to
my
knowledge
that
the
£
30
extra
fee
was
from
the
8466
onwards
and
I
booked
like
2
weeks
ago
and
nothing
was
said
about
the
extra
fee
taking
place
from
the
174
until
I
got
an
email
saying
I
had
to
pay
the
charge
the
day
before
I
was
due
to
come
to
you
.
I
get
where
the
extra
fee
is
coming
from
but
I
do
n’t
think
I
should
pay
for
that
since
I
booked
way
in
advance
and
the
charge
said
from
the
4836
on
your
booking
page
.
I
get
that
I
paid
it
but
when
deliberating
with
people
,
they
said
it
was
unfair
that
you
charged
me
for
that
.
I
believe
I
was
meant
to
pay
£
117
but
ended
but
paying
way
more
when
doing
all
my
calculations
after
leaving
the
appointment
.
So
Is
it
possible
to
get
the
refund
of
the
£
30
back
?
I
have
receipts
as
well
if
you
’d
like
to
see
?
Hope
you
understand
.

Hi
Carena
,
Thank
you
for
this
email
.
I
shall
have
my
first
draft
by

October
.
However
,
in
regards
to
the
reflective
essay
,
I
'm
a
little
bit
confused
as
to
what
we
add
in
order
for
it
to
add
up
to
2,000
.
There
's
only
so
much
I
can
add
.
I
feel
like
I
would
be
repeating
myself
in
the
essay
due
to
using
the
same
thing
in
my
reflective
questions
.
How
do
I
go
about
this
?
Thank
you
.

Hi
Urbain

I
was
unable

impression
that
we
had
2
weeks
to
complete
it
.
On

the
due

was
for

when

,
it
’s
been
changed

I
was
completely
unaware
of

well

I
'm
trying
to
get
back
into
a
routine
and
stay
on
top
of
everything
.
Also
,
I
have
a
draft
essay
due
next
month
and
I
was
wondering
whether
you
have
any
tips
on
how
to
get
started

Thanks
,

Thanks
for
the
advice
!
I
'm

around

two
approaches
Dear
Henderson
,
I
attempted
to
submit
my
draft
essay
,
but
because
of
technical
issues
,
the
document
did
n't
save
properly
and
my
notes
were
uploaded
instead
.
I
've
attached
my
final
draft
that
I
was
supposed
to
upload
.
Any
advice
on
how
to
fix
this
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Thanks

An
unhealthy
diet
is
a
major
risk
factor
for
chronic
health
problems
,
such
as
obesity
,
diabetes
and
coronary
heart
disease
.
A
growing
body
of
evidence
suggests
that
personality
traits
may
make
an
individual
more
susceptible
to
unhealthy
eating
habits
.
A
personality
trait
reflects
a
person
’s
characteristic
pattern
of
thinking
,
feeling
and
behaving
found
that
high
neuroticism
led
to
UEBs
in
males
only
.
Despite
these
limitations
,
understanding
the
influence
of
personality
traits
on
eating
habits
is
of
paramount
importance
in
developing
effective
interventions
against
unhealthy
food
intake
that
are
tailored
to
each
individual
’s
characteristic
traits
.
To
conclude
,
the
present
study
confirms
the
importance
of
the
conscientiousness
trait
in
eating
behaviours
.
However
,
further
research
is
required
to
assess
whether
health
behaviour
predictions
based
on
personality
are
affected
by
gender
and
social
desirability
bias
.
The
Covid-19
pandemic
has
led
to
the
enforcement
of
drastic
social
distancing
measures
,
which
affect
the
ways
in
which
students
interact
and
socialise
with
one
another
.
These
measures
conflict
with
the
human
instinct
to
connect
with
others
,
thus
increasing
social
isolation
and
feelings
of
loneliness
within
students
.
Analysis
1
"
It
’s
overwhelming
and
draining
"
:
negative
impacts
on
wellbeing
This
superordinate
theme
explores
the
significant
physical
and
psychological
toll
Covid-19
has
taken
on
Feya
,
fostering
a
sense
of
powerlessness
.
She
discusses
the
loss
of
control
,
predictability
and
security
within
her
life
during
these
unprecedented
times
.
1.1
"
…
I
do
n’t
see
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
"
:
depressive
symptoms
Here
,
Feya
uses
a
metaphoric
expression
,
of
being
in
a
tunnel
with
no
light
,
to
illustrate
the
sense
of
loss
of
control
she
feels
over
her
life
and
the
feeling
that
there
is
no
way
out
of
this
ordeal
.
She
sees
no
light
,
which
otherwise
symbolises
hope
,
at
the
end
of
this
dark
,
perpetual
tunnel
,
that
is
her
mind
.
This
is
further
supplemented
by
her
mention
of
feeling
"
trapped
"
,
which
implies
that
she
feels
imprisoned
by
her
own
thoughts
and
is
looking
for
an
escape
.
Feya
appears
to
be
discontent
with
life
and
tired
of
"
staring
at
the
same
four
walls
everyday
"
.
This
is
reiterated
when
she
states
that
she
is
"
living
the
same
day
,
every
day
"
.
She
feels
stuck
,
defeated
and
hopeless
.
This
creates
a
powerful
,
cyclical
imagery
of
her
depressive
thoughts
as
being
inescapable
,
as
she
goes
over
the
same
worries
over
and
over
.
"
…
I
feel
really
lonely
,
and
a
bit
depressed
and
sluggish
[
…
]
I
feel
like
I
’m
locked
in
a
box
.
"
Feya
talks
about
the
negative
emotions
felt
amidst
lockdown
restrictions
.
The
box
Feya
describes
is
a
metaphorical
representation
of
the
confinements
within
her
own
mind
,
as
well
as
the
physical
confinements
within
her
home
.
She
highlights
being
mentally
drained
and
avidly
waiting
for
lockdown
to
come
to
an
end
.
Feya
’s
use
of
the
phrase
‘
mentally
drained
’
implies
she
is
emotionally
depleted
and
burnt
-
out
due
to
the
accumulation
of
stress
in
her
personal
life
.
In
addition
,
Feya
reiterates
her
fear
of
being
‘
lonely
"
later
on
,
saying
"
I
feel
like
you
have
to
go
out
and
see
people
,
otherwise
[
…
]
you
’ll
drive
yourself
crazy
"
.
This
conveys
her
anxiety
of
being
left
alone
to
fight
all
of
these
overwhelming
feelings
by
herself
.
The
loneliness
makes
her
feel
vulnerable
.
Feya
describes
the
bodily
symptoms
of
depression
,
such
as
a
loss
of
appetite
and
insomnia
,
which
denotes
how
her
feelings
have
clearly
wreaked
havoc
on
her
physical
wellbeing
:
"
When
I
’m
drained
,
my
appetite
disappears
,
I
ca
n’t
sleep
and
my
mood
’s
just
dull
"
Feya
describes
the
sudden
,
erratic
nature
of
her
sadness
.
The
way
her
appetite
‘
disappears
’
without
warning
suggests
that
symptoms
are
unpredictable
and
out
of
her
control
.
Her
inability
to
sleep
shows
how
overwhelming
this
experience
is
,
as
her
mind
is
constantly
racing
with
negative
thoughts
,
to
the
extent
where
she
feels
disorientated
.
The
use
and
repetition
of
the
verb
‘
drained
’
connotes
a
powerful
imagery
of
a
pale
,
empty
shell
of
a
person
,
highlighting
the
invasive
,
destructive
effects
as
a
result
of
being
in
isolation
.
1.2
"
I
’ve
been
so
anxious
about
the
future
,
because
life
as
we
know
it
,
has
changed
"
:
anxious
symptoms
Within
this
superordinate
theme
,
Feya
alludes
to
her
apprehensions
about
what
the
future
holds
post
-
pandemic
.
She
is
filled
with
apprehensions
and
worries
.
Feya
talks
about
going
through
a
"
really
uncertain
time
"
,
most
of
which
revolves
around
her
professional
and
personal
life
.
She
expresses
an
unknowingness
of
"
all
of
this
is
going
to
be
over
"
.
The
pronoun
‘
all
’
denotes
that
the
current
crisis
has
impacted
every
aspect
of
her
life
.
It
depicts
the
true
extent
of
the
impact
of
Covid-19
.
Feya
expresses
how
powerless
she
feels
:
"
We
ca
n’t
plan
things
out
anymore
"
Feya
refers
to
the
lack
of
control
she
feels
,
as
her
"
many
plans
and
aspirations
"
have
been
compromised
.
The
use
of
the
collective
pronoun
,
‘
we
’
,
denotes
a
sense
of
unity
and
acts
as
an
attempt
to
regain
a
sense
of
control
.
It
provides
Feya
with
a
sense
of
reassurance
,
that
she
is
not
the
only
one
going
through
these
hardships
.
She
paints
a
picture
of
herself
as
being
powerless
,
with
no
choice
but
to
surrender
to
the
virus
.
This
is
further
exacerbated
when
Feya
appears
to
be
thinking
out
loud
,
searching
for
the
answers
to
her
many
questions
:
"
Are
we
going
back
into
lockdown
,
are
we
not
,
can
we
go
into
work
,
can
we
go
to
restaurants
and
see
our
friends
?
"
Feya
is
clearly
stuck
in
her
ruminations
,
which
is
an
expression
of
her
doubt
and
uncertainty
regarding
what
the
future
holds
.
Feya
describes
the
significant
psychological
distress
she
faced
,
induced
by
the
abrupt
nature
of
lockdown
restrictions
:
"
I-
I-
I
was
really
scared
and
cautious
and
careful
"
The
repetition
of
"
I
"
,
where
Feya
appears
to
stumble
over
her
words
,
sounds
robotic
and
reflects
how
overwhelmed
she
felt
at
the
time
.
There
is
a
strong
sense
of
fear
and
anxiety
,
depicted
through
her
selection
of
words
.
2
"
I
felt
so
distant
from
them
"
:
changes
in
social
interactions
This
superordinate
theme
reflects
the
changes
in
Feya
’s
social
habits
and
ways
of
social
interaction
.
Feya
describes
feeling
not
only
physically
distant
from
her
friends
,
but
also
emotionally
.
She
complains
about
how
they
"
would
n’t
even
be
awake
at
the
same
time
"
,
which
creates
a
barrier
that
even
digital
interactions
ca
n’t
overcome
.
She
feels
emotionally
detached
and
isolated
,
indicating
a
clear
disconnect
with
the
outside
world
due
to
the
Covid-19
crisis
.
This
is
further
emphasised
when
Feya
talks
about
losing
the
ability
to
socialise
,
saying
she
had
"
forgot
what
it
was
like
to
even
talk
to
friends
"
,
which
implies
that
being
in
social
isolation
had
stifled
her
.
2.1
"
With
your
immediate
family
members
who
you
’re
living
with
,
you
get
sick
of
and
start
bickering
"
:
interpersonal
tensions
Here
,
Feya
states
how
confinement
with
family
members
in
her
household
has
led
to
inevitable
interpersonal
tensions
,
as
a
result
of
stress
and
spending
so
much
time
together
.
The
verb
‘
bickering
’
implies
that
they
argue
over
trivial
matters
,
which
suggests
that
her
‘
dull
’
moods
not
only
impact
her
own
wellbeing
but
are
also
displaced
onto
others
.
2.2
"
If
it
was
n’t
for
social
platforms
,
I
do
n’t
know
what
I
’d
do
"
:
shift
from
physical
to
digital
communication
Feya
describes
social
media
as
being
an
essential
tool
used
to
stay
in
contact
with
her
friends
and
family
.
She
explains
that
maintaining
ties
has
"
moved
from
a
physical
form
[
…
]
to
a
digital
form
"
and
that
everyone
is
just
"
a
call
away
"
now
.
Though
she
expresses
her
gratitude
for
these
platforms
,
she
says
it
does
not
compare
to
face
-
to
-
face
contact
.
This
emphasises
how
important
physical
connection
is
to
Feya
–
it
’s
a
love
language
,
which
makes
her
feel
‘
alive
’
and
connected
.
3
"
I
’m
pretty
distracted
most
of
the
time
"
:
coping
mechanisms
amid
pandemic
The
final
superordinate
theme
portrays
how
Feya
is
coping
with
the
pandemic
.
Feya
talks
about
being
a
key
-
worker
alongside
a
university
student
,
so
she
feels
that
she
has
n’t
felt
the
impacts
of
the
pandemic
as
severely
as
others
.
The
adjective
‘
distracted
’
suggests
she
has
n’t
truly
dealt
with
the
impacts
of
the
pandemic
,
instead
she
has
diverted
her
attention
and
energy
towards
studies
and
work
to
avoid
reality
.
3.1
"
I
’ve
just
got
to
get
on
with
it
really
"
:
acceptance
Here
,
Feya
’s
tone
implies
that
she
is
ready
to
accept
the
uncontrollable
nature
of
the
Covid-19
virus
and
wants
to
proceed
forward
with
her
life
,
despite
the
turmoil
it
has
caused
.
Acceptance
is
where
the
power
lies
,
as
Feya
is
able
to
find
the
control
that
she
had
previously
lacked
.
3.2
"
It
’s
enjoyable
,
it
’s
what
life
is
about
really
"
:
maintaining
close
ties
Here
,
Feya
insinuates
the
importance
of
interpersonal
connections
through
her
use
of
language
.
She
uses
words
which
highlight
the
warmth
that
she
feels
in
the
company
of
her
friends
and
describes
how
her
mood
‘
brightens
up
’
in
their
presence
.
She
denotes
the
importance
to
continuously
attend
to
and
nurture
her
relationships
in
order
to
live
a
meaningful
life
.
She
talks
about
how
seeing
her
friends
has
had
a
really
positive
impact
on
her
mental
health
.
She
adds
that
she
does
n’t
feel
"
as
alone
"
in
their
company
,
which
shows
how
social
interactions
provide
a
sense
of
unity
,
ease
and
comfort
.
They
provide
her
with
reassurance
that
she
’s
not
the
only
one
going
through
these
difficult
times
.
Conclusion
Dealing
with
the
Covid-19
pandemic
has
taken
a
toll
on
the
social
connectedness
and
wellbeing
of
Feya
.
She
defines
her
experience
of
lockdown
as
being
overwhelming
,
draining
and
uncertain
,
as
a
result
of
social
distancing
measures
,
university
closures
and
reduced
social
contact
.
During
the
course
of
the
interview
,
we
see
a
shift
from
frustration
to
acceptance
of
the
global
pandemic
,
as
she
is
forced
to
come
to
terms
with
reality
.

god
though
like
i
checked
insurance
yesterday
and
it
was
actually
so
calm
so
i
need
to
sort
that
out
today
i
’ll
prob
start
it
for
next
week
so
the
price
is
cheaper
oooo
omg
that
’s
mad
cos
it
’s
actually
precise
otherwise
you
end
up
going
over
bareeee
without
realising
I
do
n't
understand
why
I
've
been
underpaid
again
?
I
'm
supposed
to
be
paid
37.5
hours
for
last
week
and
37.5
hours
this
week
,
as
the
system
errors
were
no
fault
of
my
own
.
I
've
been
paid
15
hours
last
week
and
only
20
this
week
.
I
've
been
waiting
all
week
for
this
to
be
sorted
,
to
be
underpaid
again
.
Hi
Noble
,
I
've
now
received
my
payslip
,
to
find
that
I
have
been
underpaid
again
for
last
week
as
well
as
this
week
.
Thanks
,
.
Hi
,
I
was
underpaid
last
week
,
with
no
access
to
my
payslips
.
I
was
told
this
would
be
sorted
by
the
following
week
.
I
've
now
received
my
payslip
,
to
find
that
I
've
been
underpaid
again
for
last
week
as
well
as
this
week
.
This
is
not
fair
,
as
system
errors
were
no
fault
of
my
own
.
I
should
be
paid
37.5
hours
for
last
week
and
the
same
for
this
week
.
Also
,
my
team
manager
has
been
off
sick
for
the
past
week
,
so
I
have
had
nobody
to
contact
regarding
any
issues
I
have
been
having
.
I
've
contacted
organisation
regarding
this
,
who
said
I
need
to
contact
my
team
manager
who
I
have
no
contact
as
she
has
n't
been
replying
to
my
messages
.
This
is
really
frustrating
as
I
'm
having
to
chase
up
and
contact
numerous
people
in
order
to
get
paid
correctly
.
I
've
been
waiting
all
week
for
this
to
be
sorted
,
just
to
have
the
same
issue
again
.
Thanks
,
.
Thank
you
I
was
only
made
aware
of
contacting
Shane
yesterday
-
I
emailed
him
regarding
my
pay
.
Before
this
as
I
had
to
deal
with
system
errors
myself
as
I
had
no
TM
to
contact
.
For
my
first
week
when
I
was
unable
to
login
,
I
raised
these
system
issues
with
Ronny
herself
.
Why
is
this
being
made
out
to
be
a
fault
on
my
part
?
I
've
been
discussing
any
issues
I
've
had
with
my
group
on
Microsoft
Teams
,
who
are
in
the
exact
same
position
as
myself
.
I
was
told
by
one
of
my
group
members
to
contact
Dominic
,
who
I
emailed
and
I
received
no
response
from
.
I
was
also
under
the
impression
that
Harvard
would
be
off
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
not
the
entire
week
.
Yesterday
,
I
had
to
contact
organisation
directly
regarding
my
system
issues
,
who
told
me
to
go
to
the
organisation
support
system
as
I
was
without
a
team
manager
.
As
I
previously
said
,
without
a
team
manager
,
I
've
had
to
deal
with
system
issues
myself
.
The
only
option
I
had
was
to
reset
my
systems
and
desktop
,
until
it
'd
start
working
again
as
I
was
not
informed
of
who
else
to
contact
,
not
through
Johnathon
,
organisation
or
organisation
!
Torey
,
I
will
still
be
available
to
work
at
the
location
business
once
the
venue
opens
up
.
My
availability
will
be
on
weekends
only
.
Many
thanks
,
.

Hi
,
can
I
get
the
organisation
promo
code
please
?
Thanks
,
.
Okay
,
thank
you
!
😁
Also
,
I
know
that
the
methods
section
is
supposed
to
be
written
in
past
tense
,
but
is
it
okay
for
me
to
switch
between
present
and
past
when
describing
the
measures
?
For
example
,
if
I
was
to
write
:
'
copied_text
'
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Vera
,
hope
you
're
doing
well
.
I
have
n't
completed
my
resubmissions
yet
as
I
have
3
deadlines
coming
up
that
I
do
n't
want
to
fall
behind
on
as
well
!
Once
I
've
submitted
my
upcoming
assignments
,
I
will
be
working
on
submitting
my
resubmissions
as
soon
as
possible
!
I
will
make
sure
to
email
you
if
I
need
any
help
😁
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Clarisa
,
I
sent
you
a
text
message
after
receiving
your
voicemail
but
I
might
have
sent
it
to
the
wrong
number
!
I
would
definitely
like
to
stay
on
the
reserved
list
please
.
Also
,
when
is
it
likely
to
pick
up
again
?
I
was
told
that
I
'd
be
starting
in
early
August
but
I
still
have
n't
had
any
shifts
so
far
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Wilma
,
hope
you
're
well
!
I
have
n't
completed
my
resubmissions

1850

Hi
,
I
requested
an
estimate
for
how
much
the
damage
to
my
car
would
cost
to
repair
not
long
ago
.
I
was
wondering
whether
I
’d
be
able
to
receive
a
report
for
that
?
My
reg
is
7718
Many
thanks
,
.
Yonina
,
Not
to
worry
,
I
did
think
it
was
a
long
shot
but
thought
it
worth
an
ask
!
I
will
definitely
take
you
up
on
the
system
appointment
for
feedback
as
soon
as
the
marksfeedback
are
released
!
And
will
be
sure
to
be
super
stringent
on
my
OSCOLA
thank
you
for
the
heads
up
!
!
In
the
mean
time
,
good
luck
with
all
the
marking
,
hopefully
you
’re
starting
to
see
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
soon
!

wishes

Hi
Gerri
,
I
was
worried
that
would
be
the
case
.
Yes
,
it
is
module
that
I
am
thinking
of
which
is
due
6097
August
.
Though
your
feedback
will
still
be
very
helpful
for
my
module
assignment
due
mid
August
.
Thank
you
anyway
.
Best
wishes

Hi
Cinda
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
Good
news
!
I
’ve
been
offered
a
place
with
the
university
to
do
an
biology
and
linguistics
starting
in
September
!
Thank
you
so
much
for
all
of
your
help
in
getting
me
here
!
I
wish
I
could
say
that
’s
the
end
of
me
bothering
you
but
I
believe
now
it
will
be
for
training
contracts
instead
I
’m
afraid
.
I
opted
for
the
chemistry
over
the
linguistics
in
the
end
,
and
also
decided
to
do
the
online
campus
option
rather
than
picking
any
specific
Dallas
campus
.
This
will
be
okay
though
wo
n’t
it
as
I
know
we
get
the
same
qualifications
out
of
it
,
and
I
just
thought
it
easier
what
with
all
the
uncertainty
at
the
minute
?
Best
wishes

Hi
Geoffrey
,
Yes
of
course
,
can
you
please
send
over
the
team
’s
link
.
.
Hi
Di
,
Thank
you
!
And
thank
you
for
all
of
your
help
in
getting
to
this
point
,
I
ca
n’t
tell
you
how
much
I
appreciate
or
value
everything
you
’ve
done
for
me
-
not
sure
I
would
have
been
able
to
navigate
the
minefield
otherwise
.
No
,
unfortunately
I
have
not
had
the
chance
to
bolster
my
CV
any
further
this
year
as
decided
to
instead
use
the
time
ensuring
all
further
reading
was
completed
as
truth
be
told
,
that
is
not
something
I
ever
managed
to
achieve
in
previous
years
!
That
being
said
,
I
am
in
the
process
of
contacting
local
business_descrs
to
ask
if
they
have
any
admin
tasks
they
would
like
a
volunteer
to
do
so
I
shall
keep
you
posted
as
to
whether
anything
comes
from
that
.
With
regards
to
the
online
learning
,
I
have
n’t
been
asked
for
my
opinion
of
it
-
do
you
mean
by
university
or
by
university
?
I
am
actually
a
very
big
fan
of
it
!
Obviously
the
lockdown
measures
alongside
it
are
far
from
ideal
and
I
am
of
course
sad
that
I
may
not
get
a
real
graduation
,
but
the
flexibility
that
it
has
provided
I
think
had
been
great
provided
you
have
the
work
ethic
required
to
keep
up
to
date
with
everything
.
The
fees
are
equivalent
to
those
for
the
Los
Angelos
campus
so
not
really
any
discount
,
but
technically
otherwise
I
would
likely
have
opted
for
the
Seattle
campus
which
was
closer
to
£
18k
.
So
for
me
it
is
technically
somewhat
cheaper
considering
it
would
have
been
a
further
£
3k
for
me
on
computer
fees
from
Britain
into
the
city
.
I
will
keep
you
posted
going
forward
,
but
I
just
wanted
your
opinion
before
I
officially
accept
the
offer
.
Best
wishes
,
.
e
a
parallel
side
of
it
that
is
n’t
helping
basically
So
I
’m
just
really
down
about
it
to
be
honest
,
I
’ve
been
at
Kimball
’
the
last
couple
of
days
and
had
a
breakdown
and
was
crying
because
obviously
if
it
is
cancer
then
it
has
infertility
issues
that
are
going
to
make
my
already
reduced
egg
count
even
more
of
an
issue
for
when
I
want
kids
And
generally
just
feel
shitty
I
’ve
got
to
call
on
Sunday
to
get
a
blood
test
to
check
if
it
is
the
asthma
and
go
from
there
The
bloods
will
check
for
it
and
go
from
there
but
did
n’t
say
much
more
be
honest
it
’s
so
hard
having
the
dr
appointments
over
the
phone
as
they
are
just
trying
to
get
you
off
the
phone
as
quick
as
possible
snd
it
’s
hard
to
get
your
point
across
I
just
feel
like
I
’m
not
getting
anywhere
with
it
And
I
’m
just
stressed
af
tbh
And
now
it
’s
going
to
sound
awful
and
I
know
it
’s
wrong
but
part
of
me
is
actually
seriously
thinking
that
if
I
’m
going
to
struggle
to
have
a
baby
,
can
I
afford
to
wait
...
Which
is
stupid
as
I
need
to
have
my
own
life
first
I
know
Idk
...
Sorry
for
the
spam
Phylys
,
Yes
a
phone
call
would
be
perfect
.
Are
you
free
around
2
pm
?
Can
you
please
call
on
1516
.
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
Donni
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
.
Unfortunately
my
work
placement
is
based
in
New
York
City
so
I
am
here
all
week
and
the
deadline
for
the
module
selection
is
the
7746
.
Sorry
,
I
am
not
making
this
easy
when
you
are
trying
to
help
!
Thank
you
.
Hi
Darin
,
Thank
you
for
checking
in
!
I
’m
well
thank
you
-
the
office
is
closed
indefinitely
so
I
am
now
working
from
home
back
in
Russia
with
my
family
.
My
accommodation
in
New
York
City
is
ongoing
but
I
am
not
planning
on
going
back
until
the
office
reopens
.
How
are
you
?
I
hope
you
are
well
in
face
of
all
this
madness
.
Regards
,
.
Glad
to
hear
you
are
okay
and
making
the
most
of
a
pretty
horrific
situation
!
I
’m
making
the
most
of
being
at
home
and
just
trying
not
to
go
mad
in
isolation
!
Speak
to
you
soon
.
Regards
,

Hi
Shea
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
so
quickly
,
I
’m
glad
to
hear
you
are
well
.
That
is
perfect
thank
you
,
my
manager
commented
in
a
call
this
morning
that
she
does
n’t
think
I
will
get
back
to
the
office
now
before
my
placement
ends
so
I
suddenly
realised
that
I
should
probably
try
and
figure
out
assignment
logistics
then
.
I
will
talk
with
my
line
manager
and
give
it
some
thought
and
let
you
know
about
whether
or
not
I
would
like
you
to
watch
it
as
I
record
it
.
Is
that
okay
?
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Cassandry
,
I
hope
you
are
healthy
and
well
still
.
I
just
thought
I
would
drop
an
email
to
ask
about
what
is
happening
regarding
my
assessments
for
my
placement
year
-
primarily
the
presentation
.
Whilst
the
self
reflective
portfolio
will
be
easy
enough
to
be
done
as
would
regularly
,
I
can
no
longer
give
my
presentation
to
my
manager
and
record
myself
using
conference
facilities
.
How
am
I
to
proceed
with
my
presentation
?
Is
it
something
that
can
be
done
and
recorded
over
Skype
?
Please
can
you
advise
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Kamillah
,
Please
forgive
my
error
but
I
forgot
to
attach
the
mentioned
screenshot
to
my

Please

Good
morning
Emory
,
Happy
New
Year
,
I
hope
you
had
a
lovely
Christmas
break
.
I
was
given
your
contact
information
for
assistance
with
considerationetc
.
regarding
assignments
pending
so
I
hope
you
can
help
me
.
Over
the
Christmas
break
,
my
mum
tested
positive
for
coronavirus
whilst
working
in
a
primary
school
,
and
then
passed
it
onto
both
my
dad
and
myself
shortly
after
.
During
this
time
I
was
very
unwell
and
am
only
just
starting
to
feel
back
to
vague
normality
now
almost
3
weeks
later
.
Obviously
whilst
it
has
been
ideal
in
the
sense
that
I
have
not
fallen
behind
on
active
seminarslectures
during
this
period
due
to
the
Christmas
break
,
it
has
meant
that
I
have
found
myself
physically
unable
to
work
on
my
numerous
assignments
I
have
coming
up
.
Of
course
,
now
I
am
working
hard
to
meet
all
my
deadlines
-
the
first
of
which
being
a
week
today
-
but
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
possibly
advise
me
as
to
any
special
consideration
that
I
may
be
entitled
to
,
or
equally
whether
this
does
not
qualify
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Brigitte
,
I
know
,
it
went
by
all
too
quickly
,
and
unfortunately
it
was
not
all
that
relaxing
for
me
as
both
of
my
parents
and
myself
had
coronavirus
for
the
Christmas
period
and
it
hit
us
all
pretty
hard
!
I
did
manage
to
get
back
to
a
bit
of
work
around
the
new
year
though
thankfully
so
I
am
still
largely
on
track
for
all
my
assignments
coming
up
.
I
have
booked
a
system
appointment
for
next
Wednesday
9873
July
as
I
have
a
couple
of
university
online
information
meetings
this
week
so
I
can
come
to
my
chat
with
you
a
bit
better
informed
hopefully
.
Thank
you
again
for
always
being
willing
to
offer
your
help
!

Dear
CEO
,
With
regards
to
your
upcoming
conference
in
Helsinki
from
the
2nd
to
4th
September
,
I
have
researched
and
identified
the
relevant
itinerary
items
for
your
trip
.
-
I
have
identified
two
potential
accommodations
within
the
£
200
per
night
budget
:
1
.
Hotel
U14
Autograph
Collection
which
would
be
closer
to
your
hotel
.
I
am
yet
to
book
any
of
the
above
for
your
stay
.
If

Hi
Jefferson
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
Sorry
to
bother
you
as
I
am
sure
you
are
inundated
with
countless
of
these
exact
same
messages
,
but
I
was
just
wondering
when
to
expect
the
results
from
our
second
module
assignment
?
I
am
getting
very
nervous
and
driving
myself
insane
checking
constantly
!
Best

Good
morning
Loren
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
know
it
is
late
in
the
year
but
I
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
chance
of
me
getting
involved
in
the
event
this
year
?
I
apologise
for
not
reaching
out
sooner
.
With
everything
going
on
with
the
Covid
restrictions
I
did
not
know
if
such
opportunities
were
being
offered
to
students
this
year
.
I
would
be
grateful
of
any
opportunities
available
and
would
be
happy
to
help
wherever
I
can
.
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
.
Best
wishes

Good

how
to
proceed
from
there

Emili
,
I
hope
you
are
safe
and
well
during
this
second
lockdown
.
Please
find
attached
my
formative
assignment
for
your
module
module
.
I
was
on
industrial
placement
last
year
and
I
certainly
felt
rusty
for
it
when
getting
back
into
the
swing
of
legal
writing
again
so
was
very
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
get
in
some
practice
and
get
your
feedback
.
I
am
more
than
happy
to
have
an
appointment
over
the
phone
or
equally
via
.
MS
teams
-
which
would
be
your
preference
?
Best
wishes

Hi
Shalom
,
Thank
you
for
being
so
accommodating
.
I
did
try
to
use
a
different
setting
but
it
seemed
less
professional
as
I
was
getting
distracted
by
noise
and
movement
.
I
hope
you
are
safe
and
well
and
looking
forward
to
the
start
of
the
Christmas
period
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Good
morning
Keith
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
have
submitted
my
video
presentation
for
module
and
am
very
happy
with
it
-
the
formative
assignment
feedback
was
very
helpful
!
I
just
wanted
to
send
an
email
to
apologise
for
the
lack
of
a
plain
background
in
my
video
submission
.
I
am
at
home
with
my
family
and
unfortunately
could
not
find
a
plain
background
anywhere
that
would
be
quiet
enough
for
me
to
do
my
recording
and
I
am
also
restricted
to
the
use
of
a
desktop
.
I
hope
that
this
is
okay
and
will
not
bare
too
much
weight
on
my
grade
.
Once
again
,
I
’m
sorry
for
this
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Good
evening
Bogart
,
I
hope
you
are
safe
and
well
during
all
this
craziness
.
I
recently
heard
about
a
weeks
virtual
placement
with
the
organisation
,
and
am
very
keen
to
throw
my
hat
in
the
ring
for
it
.
I
have
reviewed
the
application
and
it
requires
referees
.
I
have
reached
out
to
my
manager
from
my
time
on
placement
in
compliance
at
business
,
but
was
wondering
if
you
would
be
willing
to
allow
me
to
put
you
down
as
my
second
referee
?
Alternatively
if
you
can
think
of
someone
else
that
you
would
recommend
?
Best
wishes

Thank

your
email
,
that
means
a
lot
.
I
am
really
enjoying
the
module
and
am
always
more
than
happy
to
contribute
.
I
can
only
imagine
how
weird
it
must
be
for
you
having
to
run
the
webinars
online
virtually
now
I
am
looking
forward
to
our
next
module
taught
by
you
next
term
.
Have
a
lovely
Christmas

I
m
going
to
write
up
last
week
's
lecture
today
so
i
will
send
that
over
by
the
end
of
the
day
too
hopefully
.
Hi
Remus
Thank
you
for
reaching
out
to
remind
me
.
I
have
today
reviewed
what
would
have
been
the
seminar
prep
and
noticed
the
change
already
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
getting
some
further
feedback
on
the
formative
pieces
on
Thursday
.
I
may
book
a
system
appointment
from
there
if
I
have
any
further
queries
.
I
hope
you
are
safe
and
well
.
Speak
to
you
soon
.
Best

Hi
Ginger
,
Happy
New
Year
!
I
hope
you
had
a
lovely
Christmas
period
.
I
am
sorry
to
bother
you
before
your
annual
leave
is
over
,
but
I
was
hoping
to
pick
your
brains
!
I
have
been
using
the
holiday
break
to
investigate
further
my
post
-
graduate
career
plans
and
am
looking
at
the
university
for
the
next
step
to
becoming
a
job_title
.
I
have
booked
into
a
couple
of
relevant
information
sessions
through
the
unviersity
to
make
sure
I
have
fully
understood
my
options
,
but
already
from
my
research
,
I
have
some
queries
.
For
example
,
would
I
be
better
with
the
tried
and
tested
math
,
or
the
new
physics
route
?
And
equally
,
whether
it
would
be
worthwhile
doing
the
physicsmath
in
addition
?
Would
it
be
possible
to
arrange
a
call
with
yourself
to
go
over
this
when
you
return
to
work
after
your
well
earnt
holiday
?
Best
wishes
,
.
hink
I
’m
only
worried
that
with
that
are
n’t
the
eggs
more
viable
if
frozen
once
fertilised
....
?
So
I
’d
have
to
find
someone
willing
to
do
that
first
...
I
love
you
💜
💜

No

What
’s
that
?

Just
saw
this
Fucking

So
she
has
two
uteruses
?
Can
she
have
two
babies
at
once
?
I
’m
stressing
about
the
hotel
On
one
hand
Amalle
said
if
he
’s
still
here
and
not
in
Russia
then
he
’d
like
to
come
with
me
Wait
whaaaaaat
?
Yeah
I
was
wondering
who
the
maid
of
honour
was
!
I
remember
her
saying
about
a
Wandis
actually
sir
,
I
hope
you
are
well
!
Thank
you
,
sorry
to
be
a
nuisance
!
It
was
very
odd
as
I
could
access
the
other
two
.
Have
a
lovely
weekend
.
Best

Hello
Adriana
,
I
am
thank
you
-
still
trying
to
adjust
to
this
online
learning
!
It
sounds
like
you
were
soon
to
be
bombarded
with
requests
for
that
lecture
so
it
looks
like
you
had
a
close
escape
there
.

Good
afternoon
Lanita
,
I
hope
you
have
had
a
lovely
weekend
,
sorry
for
bothering
you
on
a
Sunday
.
I
know
we
have
been
asked
to
attend
our
appointed
seminars
wherever
possible
but
I
have
just
noticed
that
tomorrow
I
have
an
appointment
at
5
pm
which
would
clash
with
my
appointed
module
seminar
from
5
-
6pm
.
Would
it
be
okay
for
me
to
attend
the
4
-
5pm
session
on
this
occasion
?
Best
wishes

Hi
Magdalena
,
Thank
you
for
reaching
out
.
I
am
actually
really
enjoying
the
method
of
teaching
!
It
is
definitely
an
adjustment
but
I
have
got
into
a
very
good
routine
with
it
now
and
am
fully
up
to
date
and
working
more
effectively
than
I
think
I
ever
have
done
before
.
I
’m
currently
actually
back
at
my
family
home
rather
than
in
Philadelphia
but
I
am
still
finding
that
fine
too
.
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
amongst
all
of
the
craziness
in
San
Fransisco
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Lurlene
,
Thank
you
,
I
’m
glad
my
hard
work
is
paying
off
for
sure
and
I
’m
definitely
enjoying
everything
so
much
more
that
I
feel
like
I
can
really
get
engaged
with
the
discussions
now
that
I
’m
up
to
date
and
doing
the
readings
more
.
I
’m
glad
you
’ve
managed
to
have
some
time
off
with
your
kids
amongst
all
the
madness
as
I
can
only
imagine
trying
to
organise
the
recordings
and
everything
around
a
family
life
is
hard
!
Thank
you
for
the
support
,
I
wo
n’t
hesitate
to
reach
out
.
Best
wishes

Good
evening
Shaughn
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
currently
attempting
to
prep
for
the
seminar
on
Sunday
3588
June
but
have
encountered
a
problem
.
I
have
downloaded
the
Webinar4
instructions
but
they
seem
to
be
the
same
as
the
Webinar3
instructions
from
last
week
.
I
know
in
your
email
below
you
said
that
this
webinar
will
continue
on
to
develop
the
principles
discussed
in
the
last
but
does
this
mean
you
wish
to
go
further
into
depth
with
the
answers
from
last
week
to
expand
or
am
I
looking
at
the
incorrect
seminar
preparation
instructions
.
Please
find
the
webinar
4
instructions
attached
.
Sorry
to
bother
you
so
close
to
the
weekend
,
I
am
just
keen
to
ensure
I
do
the
prep
as
thoroughly
as
possible
.
Could
you
please
clarify
for
me
what
work
I
am
to
proceed
with
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Kizzee
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
.
I
have
done
it
with
the
numbering
system
and
have
set
the
'
footnote
'
on
a
slide
at
the
end
of
the
presentation
as
I
reread
the
guidance
and
I
think
this
is
allowed
in
addition
to
the
10
slide
maximum
.
Hopefully
this
will
be
okay
?
Thank
you
,
.
Thank
you
very
much
!
I
hope
you
have
a
relaxing
summer
also
and
that
your
marking
ahead
is
n’t
too
bad
!
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Christan
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
just
thought
I
would
drop
you
an
email
to
let
you
know
that
I
have
just
finished
the
submission
for
my
placement
project
.
I
have
uploaded
the
self
-
reflection
project
in
its
own
submission
folder
as
instructed
,
and
then
followed
the
directions
to
upload
my
video
recording
,
presentation
slides
,
handout
document
and
manager
approval
letter
in
the
second
submission
folder
.
Thank
you
again
for
all
the
help
you
have
given
me
this
year
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Good
afternoon
Denni
,
I
hope
you
are
well
!
I
’m
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
in
person
again
soon
when
uni
resumes
.
I
just
had
a
couple
of
questions
I
was
hoping
I
could
ask
you
.
Primarily
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
heard
any
updates
about
what
the
new
"
uni
norm
"
would
look
like
with
regards
to
lectures
and
seminars
online
vs.
in
person
?
Secondly
,
I
know
the
placement
assignment
guide
said
that
grades
would
be
released
in
September
but
my
friend
has
already
received
his
grades
several
weeks
ago
so
I
was
just
wondering
if
you
had
any
insight
as
to
the
date
that
my
grade
would
be
released
?
Best
wishes
,
.
Let
me
know
if
there
are
any
changes
you
want
made
.
.
Hi
Susette
,
That
is
perfect
.
Thank
you
!
I
’m
nervous
that
is
all
,
sorry
to
be
a
nuisance
!
Regards
,
.
Hi
Bernie
,
I
have
now
received
my
timetable
and
have
re
-
enrolled
but
am
still
yet
to
received
any
grade
for
my
placement
.
Would
you
please
be
able
to
chase
it
or
confirm
when
I
will
be
receiving
it
?
Kind
regards
,

The
mercantile
law
…
is
the

all
over
the
world
.
For
…
the

premises
,
the
sound
conclusions
of
reason

justice
must
universally
be
the

"
.
This
opinion
led
to
the
signing
of
the
United
Nations
Convention
on
Contracts
for
the
International
Sale
of

,
‘

,
showing
the

on
the

remains
intact
.
Thus
,
as
it
currently
stands
,
the
CISG
remains
an
unnecessary
addition
to

or
replacement
for
the

;
instead
,
it
should
remain
a

compare
its

Good
evening
Paddie
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
have
received
an
email
recently
about
a
week
virtual
placement
opportunity
with
the
organisation
,
and
I
am
very
keen
to
apply
.
I
have
reviewed
the
application
and
it
requires
a
couple
of
referees
.
I
have
reached
out
to
my
manager
from
my
placement
year
at
business
,
but
was
wondering
if
you
would
also
be
a

Hi

I
do
not

which

they
will

some
what
of
a
characteracademic
reference
type
thing
.
The

not

Good
morning
Lynnette
,
Thank
you
for
getting
back
to
me
.
I
found
the
exercise
in
yesterday
’s
webinar
very
help
,
just
as
I
did
previously
with
the
formative
assignment
feedback
so
would
very
much
appreciate
a
telephone
call
or
MS
teams
call
to
go
through
it
prior
to
the
next
piece
of
module
coursework
-
any
and
all
feedback
has
got
to
help
!
When
would
you
be
free
for
this
quick
call
?
Best
wishes
,
.
Maurine
,
Thank
you
for
checking
in
,
I
’m
getting
on
okay
with
the
working
from
home
but
am
definitely
missing
the
structure
that
the
office
life
provided
.
My
submission
is
still
a
working
progress
but
will
be
done
for
August
!
I
hope
you
are
safe
and
well
also
.
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Henri
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
getting
back
to
me
!
Sorry
for
the
confusion
and
for
the
late
notice
!
My
number
is
3039
,
if
we
call
tomorrow
morning
first
thing
around
9ish
or
any
time
after
3.30ish
that
would
be
perfect
?
Thank
you
again
,
.
Hi
Hattie
,
I
m
so
sorry
,
I
have
just
re
-
read
your
comments
on
my
project
ethics
form
and
have
only
just
fully
processed
what
you
have
written
.
With
regards
to
the
specifics
of
the
articles
,
etc
.
I
could
not
detail
these
as
I
did
not
know
the
shape
of
my
assignment
in
enough
detail
to
be
able
to
effectively
source
them
.
Secondary
,
the
data
collected
is
ALL
categorised
and
collected
already
,
I
am
simply
providing
a
new
way
to
coordinate
the
data
collected
to
be
able
to
analyse
it
as
currently
it
can
not
be
analysed
in
its
current
format
and
it
is
purely
collected
for
the
raw
data
to
be
used
to
report
to
the
leadership
teams
and
for
audit
purposes
.
My
proposed
coding
means
that
it
is
easier
to
identify
what
went
wrong
with
each
request
which
means
we
will
be
able
to
track
it
easier
in
order
to
provide
re
-
education
on
any
areas
where
it
is
required
.
I
can
get
it
in
writing
that
my
supervisor
approves
this
and
I
can
also
get
it
in
writing
from
another
more
senior
compliance
official
that
he
approves
the
new
coding
system
?
Will
this
satisfy
my
ethics
as
there
is
no
new
data
being
recorded
,
just
different
in
layout
of
the
results
in
essence
?
Please
can
you
advice
how
to
proceed
?
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
Quincey
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
just
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
my
placement
project
presentation
and
just
though
to
check
what
methodformat
of
referencing
I
am
to
use
?
I
am
assuming
that
I
am
obviously
to
use
OSCALA
,
but
am
i
to
still
use
the
number
referencing
system
as
i
would
with
an
essay
and
have
the
actual
reference
in
the
comments
section
of
the
powerpoint
or
actually
on
the
powerpoint
slide
?
Sorry
to
be
a
pain
,
i
just
want
to
ensure
that
my
referencing
is
correct
and
markable
.
Thank
you
,

Good
morning
Hari
,
Happy
New
Year
,
I
hope
you
had
a
lovely
Christmas
break
.
I
was
given
your
contact
information
for
assistance
with
considerationetc
.
regarding
assignments
pending
so
I
hope
you
can
help
me
.
Over
the
Christmas
break
,
my
mum
tested
positive
for
coronavirus
whilst
working
in
a
primary
school
,
and
then
passed
it
onto
both
my
dad
and
myself
shortly
after
.
During
this
time
I
was
very
unwell
and
am
only
just
starting
to
feel
back
to
vague
normality
now
almost
3
weeks
later
.
Obviously
whilst
it
has
been
ideal
in
the
sense
that
I
have
not
fallen
behind
on
active
seminarslectures
during
this
period
due
to
the
Christmas
break
,
it
has
meant
that
I
have
found
myself
physically
unable
to
work
on
my
numerous
assignments
I
have
coming
up
.
Of
course
,
now
I
am
working
hard
to
meet
all
my
deadlines
-
the
first
of
which
being
a
week
today
-
but
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
possibly
advise
me
as
to
any
special
consideration
that
I
may
be
entitled
to
,
or
equally
whether
this
does
not
qualify
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Jethro
,
I
know
,
it
went
by
all
too
quickly
,
and
unfortunately
it
was
not
all
that
relaxing
for
me
as
both
of
my
parents
and
myself
had
coronavirus
for
the
Christmas
period
and
it
hit
us
all
pretty
hard
!
I
did
manage
to
get
back
to
a
bit
of
work
around
the
new
year
though
thankfully
so
I
am
still
largely
on
track
for
all
my
assignments
coming
up
.
I
have
booked
a
system
appointment
for
next
Sunday
6503
December
as
I
have
a
couple
of
university
online
information
meetings
this
week
so
I
can
come
to
my
chat
with
you
a
bit
better
informed
hopefully
.
Thank
you
again
for
always
being
willing
to
offer
your
help
!
BW

That
’s
my
worst
nightmare

that
’s
what
I
’m
worried

Good

Consolata
,
I
am
trying
to
get
into

our
seminar
but
am
having
technical
difficulties
.
According

the
year
group
chat
I
am
not
the
only
one

I
will
continue
to
try

Hi
Randee
,
I
hope
you
had
a
lovely
weekend
and
the
marking
of
our
assignments
is
n’t
causing
you
too
much
pain
!
I
know
we
have
the
four
weeks
period
for
receiving
assignment
feedback
but
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
give
me
an
indication
of
your
thoughts
on
mine
once
you
have
read
it
as
would
appreciate
the
feedback
for
my
next
assignment
that
I
am
presenting
working
on
.
I
appreciate
you
can
not
go
into
specifics
until
after
moderation
has
been
carried
outit
is
published
officially
.
However
,
anything
you
could
offer
me
would
be
much
appreciated
.
Thank
you
,
look
forward
to
seeing
you
in
the
seminar
on
Monday
.
Best
wishes
,

Francesca
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
currently
in
the
process
of
reviewing
my
modules
for
final
year
following
my
placement
with
business
this
year
.
I
know
we
discussed
this
last
year
when
I
met
with
you
following
the
module
assignment
results
,
but
I
was
hoping
I
could
get
your
expertise
on
it
one
last
time
before
I
submit
my
choices
next
week
.
I
have
done
some
further
research
into
it
and
am
thinking
of
taking
the
following
:
module
Mandatory
module
module
Mandatory
module
module
This
is
an
area
of
interest
for
me
"
Eighth
foundation
subject
"
to
be
studied
in
the
course
The
coursework
part
of
the
assignment
is
a
client
interview
and
advice
letter
which
I
really
enjoy
doing
and
did
well
on
in
the
module
assignment
last
year
module
I
think
this
will
be
a
very
interesting
topic
This
is
a
module
with
100
%
course
work
which
will
place
less
pressure
on
me
for
my
summer
exams
I
am
then
trying
to
choose
between
the
two
following
:
module
Pros
:
100
%
practical
based
coursework
which
I
enjoy
and
think
will
allow
me
to
get
the
higher
mark
The
topic
will
be
very
helpful
for
me
in
my
future
career
,
whatever
area
I
choose
to
pursue
The
negotiation
aspect
I
did
last
year
and
really
enjoyed
and
also
did
really
well
in
Cons
:
I
have
already
got
negotiation
work
experience
on
my
CV
from
the
competition
last
year
,
would
I
be
better
trying
to
"
add
another
string
to
my
bow
"
,
so
to
say
?
module
Pros
:
Interesting
Would
add
the
international
aspect
of
subject
to
my
CVknowledge
I
enjoyed
and
did
well
in
my
module
module
last
year
Cons
:
Coursework
aspect
is
likely
to
be
an
analysis
task
which
I
am
not
as
strong
in
I
selected
module
last
year
so
do
already
have
an
element
of
that
in
my
CV
already
I
do
not
actually
want
to
go
into
subject
,
I
am
more
interested
in
subject
Essentially
,
as
I
think
I
would
enjoy
both
modules
equally
,
I
am
trying
to
gage
whether
I
would
be
best
doing
the
module
module
which
I
think
I
would
potentially
do
better
in
,
or
the
module
module
which
I
think
would
add
another
element
to
my
CV
.
I
am
very
conscious
that
the
final
year
is
the
heaviest
weighted
year
and
also
the
most
stressful
so
I
am
trying
to
select
the
modules
that
I
think
I
will
do
the
best
in
and
will
also
be
the
best
for
me
to
manage
my
workload
and
stress
levels
throughout
the
year
.
From
the
perspective
of
somebody
that
has
done
well
in
the
industry
,
could
you
please
advise
me
as
to
whether
you
think
I
will
be
doing
myself
a
disservice
if
I
do
stick
with
my
gut
instinct
of
the
module
?
Also
,
does
it
look
poorly
from
an
employer
's
perspective
if
I
do
not
take
more
"
traditional
subject
modules
"
?
Thank
you
,
.
 
I
hope
you
had
a
lovely
Christmas
and
New
Year
!
I
was
just
wondering
when
is
best
for
you
to
arrange
the
onsite
placement
visit
?
Also
,
where
can
I
find
that
ethics
test
thing
you
mentioned
?
I
ca
nt
see
it
anywhere
!
Thanks
.
Hi

you

June

With
regards
to
my
assignment
I
have
done
planning
and
have
done
work
towards
the
presentation

I
do
not
think
I
will

to
present
it
just
yet
.
Is
that
okay
with
you
?
Thanks
.
Hi
Gayleen
Thank
you
!
That
works
perfectly
,
it
will
most
likely
be
15
mins
on
an
Uber
to
get
to
my
work
from
the
station
so
whenever
is
best
for
you
.
Thanks

my
updated
manifesto
-
can
you
please
open
it
and
check

okay
for
you

it
at

.
Thanks

Ofella

Thank
you

relatively
unscathed
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
.
My

is

,
or
equally
I
am
happy
to
have
a
MS
Teams
call
instead
-
which
would
you
prefer
?
.
Good
evening
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
messaged
Sibel
over
the
weekend
after
seeing
his
Facebook
post
regarding
student
accommodation
and
he
was
kind
enough
to
put
me
in
contact
with
you
.
I
was
hoping
you
could
help
me
.
I
have
a
tenancy
contract
at
building
accommodation
and
moved
my
stuff
in
on
move
in
day
but
only
stayed
for
5
days
as
my
hypothermia
got
really
bad
with
everything
going
on
and
people
coming
and
going
.
My
parents
got
to
the
point
where
they
asked
me
to
come
home
as
I
was
n’t
eating
,
sleeping
or
leaving
my
room
at
all
for
that
duration
,
so
I
did
and
I
have
remained
home
ever
since
.
I
reached
out
to
building
to
inquire
about
terminating
my
contract
on
those
medical
grounds
and
they
advised
me
that
I
required
a
doctors
note
.
I
obtained
one
of
these
from
my
GP
who
agreed
I
should
not
return
to
uni
currently
,
and
also
gave
my
accommodation
details
of
the
counselling
I
am
undergoing
for
my
severe
cancer
.
I
gave
all
of
this
to
building
towards
the
end
of
last
year
and
heard
back
from
them
on
5030
October
to
say
that
it
’s
being
passed
onto
the
owner
of
the
property
and
it
is
now
out
of
their
hands
.
I
am
yet
to
hear
anything
and
am
not
getting
responses
to
my
voicemails
or
emails
;
I
am
however
due
to
pay
my
next
instalment
of
rent
and
they
are
quick
to
email
me
to
request
this
.
I
was
hoping
you
could
offer
me
any
further
advice
as
to
any
further
steps
I
could
take
as
I
’m
really
starting
to
worry
.

As

in

I
have
booked
a

with
you

Can
we
please
go
over
any
feedback
you
can
offer
me
for
my
previous
submission
in
preparation
for
the
second
upcoming
deadline
.
e
taken
multiple
pregnancy
tests
and
they
are
all
negative
So
I
called
the
dr
and
got
appointments
I
had
an
internal
scan
last
week
And
the
woman
basically
did
something
that
kinda
stimulated
a
mild
version
of
the
pain
on
my
left
side
And
she
said
what
it
was
then
was
actually
gas
in
my
bowel
blocking
the
ultrasound
seeing
my
ovary
so
she
was
moving
it
to
try
and
scan
the
ovary
So
basically
I
had
a
follow
up
with
the
dr
yesterday
And
what
he
said
is
that
he
thinks
I
have
monkey
pox
And
that
the
pain
is
part
cyst
on
my
left
one

I

there
was
any

I

be
able
to
contact
the

who
initially
wanted
to
set
up
this

,
if
I
’d
be
able
to
ask
them
a

questions
,
such
as
what
they
intended
to
dohow
they
wanted
to
run
the

If
this
is

you
can
help
me

then
that
would
be
much
appreciated

Hey
Hermon
...
I
have
a
question
.
Has
the
rota
for
the
week
of
the
6934
November
been
written
yet
?
Nothings
wrong
.
I
just
was
wondering
if
I
could
know
when
I
was
working
that
week
.
In
this
essay
,
I
will
mention
the
key
features
of
the
psychodynamic
approach
,
such
as
Freud
and
the
unconscious
mental
processes
,
and
those
of
the
biological
approach
–
genetics
,
heredity
and
evolution
.
Core
assumptions
,
such
as
the
role
of
nature
and
nurture
in
the
key
features
,
will
also
be
remarked
upon
and
compared
.
This
essay
will
allude
to
how
these
perspectives
are
different
,
their
stands
on
the
nature
-
nurture
debate
,
and
how
they
are
similar
–
such
as
the
influence
of
childhood
.
The
key
features
of
the
psychodynamic
approach
are
mostly
synonymous
to
Sigmund
Freud
,
and
his
research
with
unconscious
mental
processes
.
This
approach
focuses
on
the
influence
of
the
‘
unconscious
’
and
how
our
behaviour
as
adults
is
rooted
from
childhood
experiences
.
There
are
differences
in
the
perspectives
,
such
as
the
psychanalytical
approach
considering
nurture
to
have
more
influence
but
the
biological
approach
considering
the
interaction
of
nature
and
nurture
having
equal
amount
of
effect
on
behaviour
.
In
conclusion
,
the
biological
and
psychodynamic
are
much
more
similar
than
what
would
first
be
assumed
.

This
sounds
like
a
really
interesting
idea
.
I
know
that
term
2
of
last
year
there
was
a
society
set
up
in
the
organisation
,
which
could
have
looked
at
something
similarly
to
what
you
’re
suggesting
or
something
more
broader
for
more
students
.
Have
there
been
other
students
in
the
module
module
interested
in
this
also
?
Do
I
need
to
have
something
written
soon
for
this
or
is
this
still
a
throw
around
idea
at
the
moment
?

mentioned
above
?
For

I
was
a
committee
member
for
a
society
this
year
,
a
student
rep
,
peer
mentor
,
job_title
and
Buddy
.
Would
it
then
be
in
my
best
interest
to
just
pick
one
and
detail
that
as
much
as
I
can
rather
than
pick
2
or
3

explain
?
Many

Hi
Grace
,
So
I
'm
looking
to
be
able
to
access
the
society
for
university
.
.
To
whom
this
may
concern
,
I
am
just
curious
about
the
cost
of
taking
a
language
outside
of
my
degree
.
I
took
a
language
in
my
first
year
and
am
looking
to
continue
this
into
my
second
year
.
I
remember
seeing
the
price
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
but
I
can
not
remember
what
it
is
now
.
Would
you
be
able
to
email
me
the
price
of
the
course
,
I
think
it
was
either
£
250
or
£
450
but
I
would
like
to
be
sure
.
Many
thanks

Hello

I

that
does

have
an

version
on

:

This
book
has
plenty

in

but
as
the

is
closed
and
I
am
no
longer
on

I
was
wondering
how
I
would
go
about
trying
to
get
this
book
.
Do
I
ask
if
I
can
have
the
book
posted
?
Would
there
be
a

to
get
eBook
access
?
Any

Hi
Ninnette
,
Firstly
I
would
like
to
apologise
for
spelling
your
name
incorrectly
in
my
first
email
to
you
.
Secondly
,
thank
you
for
the
email
back
to
clarify
how
the

is
still
trying
to
help
students
.
I
will
definitely
have
a
look
around
on

for
other
topic
books
,
thank
you
.
I
have
another
question
.
I
have
library
books
currently
in
my
possession
.
I
've
read
other
library
messages
about
the
deadline
for
books
being
extended
to
around
the
4627
September
because
that
would
be
the
end
of
Term
3
,
and
that
students
do
n't
have
to
keep
updating
the
library
system
each
week
to
extend
the
return
date
as
it
's
automatically
set
to
in
September
.
My
question
is
:
If
the
University
library
is
not
open
by
that
time
,
would
students
be
recommended
to
post
their
library
books
through
Royal
Mail
or
hold
onto
them
until
Term
1
in

?

Parenting
Is
defined
by
‘
Purposive
activities
aimed
at
ensuring
the
survival
and
development
of
children
which
found
that
there
was
an
association
between
maternal
depression
and
a
child
’s
negative
behaviour
and
psychopathology
.
To
conclude
,
it
is
evident
that
there
is
an
association
between
parenting
and
child
development
,
with
the
influence
on
parenting
styles
,
the
socio
-
economic
status
of
the
parent
,
alongside
with
the
well
-
being
of
the
parent
.
From
these
aspects
it
can
be
concluded
that
various
aspects
of
the
parent
’s
life
solely
have
a
direct
and
indirect
effect
on
child
development
.
Cal

Okay
that
’s

know
I
guess
I
’m
not

Good
Morning
Lorry
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
need
some
advice
on
what
to
do
,
if
I
remember
correctly
I
do
n't
think
my
DBS
fully
processed
because
the
organisation
office
required
to
have
a
current
bank
statement
bank
letter
which
never
able
to
get
for
some
reason
because
it
always
got
sent
to
my
house
in
Chicago
.
So
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
got
back
to
getting
an
updated
one
.
And
due
to
the
current
situation
of
COVID
the
office
I
'm
assuming
is
closed
,
to
give
them
an
updated
one
,
so
what
should
I
do
about
this
situation
.
I
apologize
for
the
inconvenience
this
has
caused
.
Many
Thanks
.
Thank
you
Colly
!
To
SirMadam
,
Earlier
this
year
for
my
job_title
position
in
organisation
as
it
was
in
the
organisation
had
to
get
a
DBS
check
,
during
the
process
it
was
required
for
me
to
present
some
documentation
,
which
included
a
bank
statement
which
was
endorsed
branch
stamp
but
I
was
unable
to
get
a
hold
it
as
it
was
sent
to
my
San
Antonio
address
.
I
was
wondering
as
I
am
currently
at
home
if
I
could
still
scan
over
the
documentation
needed
in
order
for
me
to
get
my
DBS
as
I
am
in
need
of
it
for
my
placement
.
I
apologize
for
the
inconvenience
this
has
caused
.
Many
Thanks

The
topic
of
research
investigated
was
Perception
of
Beauty
,
this
topic
was
chosen
as
a
result
of
its
major
current
infleunce
within
today
’s
society
from
influencing
an
individual
’s
perception
of
beauty
about
themselves
and
beauty
as
a
social
construct
.
Furthermore
,
the
perception
surrounding
beauty
has
not
just
been
relevant
to
within
today
’s
society
it
also
has
had
major
influences
throughout
history
in
terms
of
the
ideal
body
image
evidently
seen
with
icons
such
as
Marilyn
Monroe
and
desired
hairstyles
amongst
culture
throughout
history
.
A
Discourse
Analysis
inspired
by
Willig
statement
that
‘
society
is
becoming
increasingly
concerned
with
mechanisms
to
obtain
or
improve
beauty
,
such
as
beauty
enhancements
,
body
modiﬁcation
.
’
This
is
apparent
within
todays
current
concerns
concerning
surgeries
such
as
Brazilian
Butt
Lifts
to
achieve
the
‘
ideal
body
type
’
,
as
statistics
show
that
it
is
deadliest
type
of
plastic
surgery
with
3000
cases
of
death
.
Through
this
statistic
it
reveals
the
social
pressure
as
a
discursive
object
to
achieve
the
ideal
perception
of
beauty
.
Moreover
,
it
can
also
be
discussed
that
social
media
such
as
Instagram
is
not
the
only
outlet
of
media
that
produces
pressure
as
a
discursive
object
.
Media
outlets
such
as
magazines
can
also
present
a
discourse
of
pressure
and
damage
about
perception
of
beauty
,
this
is
explicit
within
criticism
surrounds
fashion
magazines
such
as
Vogue
;
as
they
were
criticised
for
photoshopping
their
‘
cover
to
make
plus
-
sized
model
look
thinner
’
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
Susan
’s
attitude
towards
these
discourses
holds
a
certain
credibility
about
the
rising
concerns
of
beauty
standards
within
today
’s
society
.
Susan
recognises
that
the
perception
of
beauty
discussed
for
majority
of
the
interview
was
Westernised
perceptions
of
beauty
and
recognises
the
other
cultural
perceptions
of
beauty
.
This
demonstrates
beauty
as
an
ethnocentric
discursive
object
as
within
every
culture
what
is
perceived
as
beautiful
to
one
may
be
perceived
undesirable
to
another
,
in
addition
it
also
shows
the
equal
weighing
of
environment
playing
an
equal
factor
in
perceptions
of
beauty
in
correspondence
to
media
which
is
normally
the
first
considered
influenced
on
beauty
.
Discourse
5-
Perceptions
of
beauty
is
never
fixed
Susan
shows
that
the
discourse
of
beauty
is
temporal
,
as
throughout
history
what
was
concerned
as
beautiful
changed
this
is
apparent
through
eras
in
history
such
as
Egyptian
Beauty
and
Victorian
Beauty
.
As
Egyptian
beauty
included
both
male
and
females
going
to
great
lengths
regarding
appearance
,
consisting
of
dramatic
dark
eye
makeup
and
wigs
in
contrast
to
the
Victorian
Era
which
involved
a
pale
face
and
rosy
cheeks
.
The
vast
difference
in
beauty
amongst
these
two
eras
demonstrates
the
discourse
of
beauty
being
temporal
.
Susan
appears
to
present
that
the
discourse
of
beauty
is
not
completely
objective
or
subjective
but
in
fact
there
is
middle
ground
as
the
discursive
objects
such
as
culture
,
genre
,
era
play
a
role
in
the
objective
aspect
of
standards
of
beauty
.
Alongside
with
the
subjective
aspect
in
relation
to
having
a
choice
in
what
type
of
beauty
an
individual
wants
to
adopt
.
Discussion
Throughout
the
interview
the
discourses
presented
demonstrate
the
complexity
of
perceptions
of
beauty
.
This
can
be
seen
with
the
two
opposing
aspects
concerning
the
discourse
of
outward
appearance
,
as
on
one
spectrum
it
is
perceived
as
futile
as
it
conveys
an
unrealistic
beauty
standard
to
obtain
.
whilst
on
the
other
spectrum
outward
beauty
in
relation
to
style
is
not
frowned
upon
as
it
is
perceived
as
beauty
to
aspire
to
,
in
relation
to
providing
a
guide
on
fashion
.
Furthermore
,
this
interview
also
demonstrated
the
various
influences
on
both
an
individual
’s
perception
of
beauty
and
societal
construct
concerning
beauty
which
is
contingent
on
music
genre
,
history
era
and
culture
.
Therefore
,
showing
a
grey
area
in
having
a
perception
of
beauty
as
a
ones
percpetion
of
beauty
can
not
be
completely
right
or
wrong
.

Hi
Eddy
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
I
wanted
to
ask
about
placement
year
I
’m
still
looking
for
placements
and
I
feel
a
bit
discouraged
as
I
constantly
looking
but
it
does
n’t
see
promising
at
the
moment
and
I
feel
like
I
’m
slowly
running
out
of
time
.
What
should
I
do
?

2nd
year
course
Within
the
study
of
Psychology
,
the
Biological
and
Psychoanalytical
perspectives
have
contributed
immensely
in
relation
to
its
similarities
and
differences
of
its
core
assumptions
and
features
.
As
the
assumptions
within
the
Biological
perspective
consist
on
behaviour
being
solely
a
result
of
biology
such
as
neurotransmitter
and
genetics
;
in
comparison
to
the
core
assumptions
of
the
Psychoanalytical
perspective
which
consist
of
behaviour
-
based
experiences
within
the
environment
and
the
unconscious
.
In
the
following
essay
,
I
will
discuss
the
key
features
and
assumptions
of
both
perspectives
revolving
around
their
similarities
and
differences
.
The
Biological
Perspective
adopts
the
nature
approach
to
behaviour
,
as
its
assumptions
solely
revolve
around
the
concept
of
behaviour
is
hard
-
wired
.
This
is
evident
within
its
explanation
for
disorders
such
as
Schizophrenia
as
Gottesman
.
In
conclusion
,
despite
both
the
Biological
and
Psychoanalytical
perspective
holding
majority
of
differences
within
their
assumptions
alongside
the
nature
of
their
key
features
holding
similarities
both
perspectives
have
successfully
become
an
integral
part
of
Psychology
today
.
Good
afternoon
,
organisation
I
just
wanted
to
ask
if
my
placement
documentation
was
uploaded
into
my
system
because
I
can
no
longer
upload
another
document
.
Does
this
mean
I
can
submit
my
placement
and
it
can
be
confirmed
by
the
university
.

Hi
Lilllie
,
The

module
.
Kind

Second
Year
course
Good
afternoon
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
wanted
to
enquire
about
how
much
student
finance
I
would
get
and
how
to
notify
student
finance
that
I
’m
doing
an
unpaid
placement
.
As
I
received
the
incorrect
amount
as
they
assumed
I
was
doing
a
paid
placement
I
believe
as
I
could
not
provide
evidence
at
the
time
that
it
was
unpaid
.
How

I
did
n't
have

my

allow

they
asked
for
a
bank
letter
which
was
at

have
it
now
so
I
plan

,
Janot
apologies
to
bother
you
,
is
there
a
chance
that
the
deadline
for
my
exam
can
be
extended
I
have
n't
finished
and
I
have
been
dealing
with
some
family
issues
.
So
I
was
wondering
if
could
be
possible
if
it
could
be
extended
.
Kind

Good
Morning
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
wanted
to
enquire
about
the
paperwork
I
need
to
upload
for
my
placement
to
be
approved
in
the
handout
it
said
I
need
a
document
with
the
Job
description
and
my
signature
provided
,
but
I
only
have
a
document
which
has
the
job
description
listed
and
the
tasks
that
I
would
have
to
do
which
does
n't
have
a
signature
.
In
addition
,
the
paperwork
I
had
to
fill
in
for
my
placement
is
agreements
and
DBS
checks
would
u
like
to
upload
one
of
them
also
to
confirm
that
I
have
a
placement
with
them
or
just
the
job
description
.
Furthermore
,
I
spoke
to
my
placement
about
the
ending
date
of
placement
,
and
they
said
that
from
the
date
I
chose
I
would
have
to
calculate
the
number
days
I
would
have
the
placement
depending
on
the
minimummaximum
number
of
days
my
uni
requires
for
placement
.
So
I
wanted
to
enquire
what
is
the
minimum
-
maximum
days
the
uni
requires
for
a
placement
?
Kind
Regards
,

filled

Hi
team
,
Just
wondering
if
there
is
a
date
set
yet
for
when
the
exam
timetables
will
be
released
?
Thanks
,

Hi
Benedict
,
Thank
you
for
sending
me
all
the
information
for
the
study
.
I
have
read
over
it
this
weekend
and
I
am
happy
to
take
part
.
Would
it
be
a
problem
if
we
do
n’t
quite
have
50
articles
for
each
section
?
I
have
n’t
checked
yet
,
but
I
’m
not
sure
I
’ve
written
50
emails
to
university
.
I
’ve
attached
the
consent
form
above
,
Thanks
!
..
Hi
Helsa
,
Thank
you
for
answering
my
query
.
And
yes
I
’m
happy

proceed
with
the
data
collection
.
Thanks

Hi
Walsh
,
I
am
so
sorry
for
cancelling
,
long
story
short
,
my
dog
had
a
litter
less
than
a
week
ago
and
1
of
the
puppies
has
n’t
been
well
.
I
got
caught
up
at
the
vets
and
when
I
saw
I
was
n’t
going
to
be
back
in
time
,
I
cancelled
the
system
.
Have
only
just
gotten
the
time
to
email
you
now
.
Again
I
’m
really
sorry
and
I
will
reschedule
the
system
.
Kind
regards
,
..
Carolie
,
I
can
only
apologise
.
I
’m
really
sorry
,
usually
I
cancel
before
the
allocated
slot
but
forgot
to
this
morning
.
I
’m
really
desperate
for
an
appointment
however
I
’ve
had
no
luck
booking
a
slot
that
works
for
me
.
Every
time
I
go
on
system
all
the
slots
are
already
taken
and
I
end
up
having
to
take
whichever
one
is
left
.
This
has
been
happening
for
a
few
weeks
now
.
Is
there
any
way
I
can
get
around
this
?
What
day
do
the
slots
gets
released
?
Again
I
’m
really
sorry
that
I
have
wasted
your
time
and
other
student
’s
as
well
.
Hi
Britt
,
I
’m
not
sure
whether
you
will
be
able
to
answer
this
,
but
I
have
a
query
about
one
of
the
MCQ
for
topic
.
The
question
was
about
the
UK
’s
position
on
organ
donation
.
I
was
unsure
whether
to
put
soft
-
opt
in
or
soft
-
opt
out
,
as
I
am
presuming
that
at
the
time
you
wrote
the
exam
paper
the
answer
would
have
been
opt
-
in
.
However
,
as
of
earlier
this
year
the
law
is
set
to
change
now
to
opt
-
out
.
By
‘
current
position
’
did
you
mean
the
law
as
it
currently
stands
,
or
the
new
position
that
has
been
agreed
?
Thanks
in
advance
and
I
understand
if
you
are
not
able
comment
on
this
.

Hi

,
Thank
you

that
.
I

Have
a
great
day

Hi
Traci
,
I
know
this
is
a
long
shot
,
but
I
’m
just
making
my
way
into
university
now
for
the
module
exam
,
and
I
have
just
realised
I
’ve
left
my
book
book
at
home

I
am
really
panicking
now
and
I
was
wondering
whether
there
will
there
be
any
spares
available
in
the
exam
?
Thanks

Hi
Haley
,

I
appreciate
the
interview
opportunity
,
but
I

not
interested

Hi
team
,
I
have
recently
decided
that
I
no
longer
want

I
need
to
do
now
to
confirm
going
into
my
final
year
and
how
do
I
select
which
modules
I
want
to
take
?
Thanks

Katherina
,
I
’m
a
final
year
course
student
at
university
and
have
a
question
about
the
summative
assessment
for
the
module
module
.
I
was
wondering
whether
we
could
make
reference
to
the
current
Covid-19
pandemic
in
our
answer
,
and
how
this
might
impact
the
client
’s
prospects
of
finding
new
employment
.
Or
,
whether
we
should
write
the
letter
of
advice
as
if
coronavirus
was
n’t
happening
.
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Karsten
,
Yes
,
that
’s
me
!
I
’m
surprised
you
’ve
remembered
from
the
which
just
opened
the
slides
up
as
a
new
tab
,
or
as
an
ebook
.
I
was
just
wondering
if
this
is
just
a
system
error
,
and
whether
we
’ll
be
able
to
download
the
PowerPoint
presentation
as
normal
next
week
.
Many
thanks
,
..
you
planning
on
meeting
him
again
?
Where
did
you
meet
up
yesterday
?
Oh
well
was
n’t
exactly
what
you
were
looking
for
but
at
least
it
was
n’t
a
bad
experience
Now
you
need
to
carry
on
working
towards
your
next
hinge
encounter
Already
following
it
Find
it
funny
how
she
’s
says
to
put
them
back
Bit
late
for
that
He
says^^
I
did
think
that
cause
it
’s
the
same
surname
and
Heidi
has
the
flowers
business
Very
cute
ca
n’t
believe
how
quickly
they
grow
!
!
They
’re
constantly
eating
tbf
Bloody
hell
can
not
believe
I
’ve
just
been
violated
by
Cassey
yet
because
they
have
n’t
got
the
collars
on
yet
so
ca
n’t
keep
track
of
them
,
they
’re
not
even
a
week
old
yet
so
they
do
n’t
really
do
much
other
than
sleep
and
eat
The
one
that
was
unwell
yesterday
seems
absolutely
fine
now
which
is
fab
Oh
it
’s
got
a
4
now
on
the
end
because
mum
locked
my
account
and
I
had
to
change
it
I
’ve
got
a
small
window
of
time
soon
so
I
’ll
ft
you
in
the
next

Also

better

Team
,
I
just
have
a
couple
of
things
I
hope
you
’ll
be
able
to
help
me
with
.
A
couple
of
weeks
ago
I
got
into
contact
with
you
about
how
I
was
still
receiving
emails
from
lecturers
and
from
the
assessment
team
about
submitting
assignments
and
completing
exams
.
I
was
told
I
should
n’t
have
been
receiving
any
of
these
emails
,
however
I
still
am
.
Also
,
the
information
on
system
about
my
provisional
assessment
results
has
n’t
changed
,
I
’m
still
being
marked
0
for
assignments
.
Will
this
reset
when
I
being
my
3rd
year
again
in
August
?
Finally
,
I
was
wondering
whether
I
would
need
to
reselect
my
Year
3
optional
modules
,
or
whether
I
would
automatically
be
assigned
the
same
topics
I
chose
for
this
year
that
I
was
not
able
to
complete
.
My
student
number
is

Thanks

Dear

now
at
ease

Have
a

Hi
team
,
I
’m
a
final

course
student
and
I
was
wondering
when
our
module
selection
will
become
available
on
system
.
Thanks

Hi
Konstantin
,
I
am
back
to
finish
my
final
year
of
course
after
taking
a
leave
of
absence
for
the
2524
-
3561
academic
year
.
Unfortunately
,
I
am
not
yet
able
to
move
back
onto
campus
due
to
a
caring
responsibility
.
Luckily
,
I
am
able
to
access
all
module
materials
online
via
pre
-
recorded
lectures
and
live
webinars
.
Do
I
need
to
let
someone
know
about
my
current
circumstances
,
or
am
I
ok
to
carry
on
as
normal
?
I
’m
not
too
sure
on
what
TP1
will
entail
and
I
do
n’t
want
to
be
too
affected
by
not
moving
back
to
University
and
missing
out
on
additional
content
that
is
not
being
taught
online
.
Thanks

Hi
Tabb
,
I
was
wondering
whether
we
have
to
attend
our
allocated
webinar
times
?
I
have
decided
not
to
move
back
onto
campus
because
of
covid-19
and
I
am
trying
to
work
my
studies
around
my
job
.
Thus
,
webinars
will
be
extremely
important
to
me
.
Are
we
able
to
join
in
with
the
other
time
instead
,
or
is
this
something
I
would
need
to
take
up
with
the
programme
office
to
change
my
webinar
group
?
Thanks
,
..
h
I
did
n’t
realise
either
cause
did
n’t
see
my
reflection
anywhere
and
completely
forgot
I
put
it
on
when
I
went
up
stair
Then
when
I
realised
I
was
sooo
embarrassed
Wyd
Chilling
on
the
bed

’ll
try
but

Kevyn
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
I
’ll
contact
the
placement
team
now
.
I
already
know
what
modules
I
want
to
take
-
do
you
know
when
exactly
in
JuneDecember
I
’ll
be
able
to
confirm
my
choices
?
Thanks
in

Hi
Vanny
,
I
want
to
opt
out
of
the
placement
year
and
go
straight
into
my
final
year
.
How
do
I
go
about
doing
this
?
Thanks
,
..
Hi
Lindi
,
I
’ve
not
been
able
to
find
a
suitable
placement
choice
for
me
.
Therefore
,
I
think
it
’s
best
to
go
into
my
final
year
,
rather
than
spend
a
year
working
somewhere
I
would
n’t
fully
enjoy
.
I
have
chosen
which
modules
I
want
to
do
for
my
final
year
,
how
do
I
go
about
selecting
these
options
?
Thanks
in
advance

Hi
Team
,
I
’ve
just
spoken
to
one
of
the
library
staff
members
and
they
’ve
advised
me
to
send
an
email
in
order
to
show
interest
in
acquiring
one
of
the
lockers
that
you
manage
in
the
Main
Building
.
Please
would
you
be
able
to
keep
me
updated
if
they
open
up
locker
reservations
to
the
general
students
.
Thanks

Hi
Tasia
,
I
am
a
final
year
course
student
and
I
’ve
just
had
a
look
through
your
emails
concerning
event
.
Unfortunately
,
due
to
a
family
emergency
I
had
to
get
a
train
back
home
this
past
Saturday
.
My
mum
is
currently
populated
,
but
I
am
hoping
to
be
back
to
uni
by
next
week
when
lectures
start
.
I
will
subsequently
not
be
able
to
attend
the
event
sessions
of
this
week
and
was
wondering
who
is
the
best
person
to
speak
to
about
this
.
Will
the
workshops
be
uploaded
onto
system
,
or
is
there
another
way
that
I
can
catch
up
?
Thanks
in
advance
,
..
now
right
glad
we
got
some
more
boys
,
more
comfortable
giving
them
away
than
the
girls
tbh
because
of
breeding
Started
at
1
am
Took
bloody
ages
in
between
them
all
Around
7
and
then
we
all
went
to
sleep

absolutely
shattered
still
So
nice
to
hear
their
little
baby
whines
though

sure
it
’ll
become
annoying

Hi

I
looked

Is
this

Good
morning
Alton
,
A
few
weeks
ago
I
booked
a
system
appointment
with
you
to
discuss
everything
that
’s
going
on
with
my
mum
.
Unfortunately
,
we
were
told
last
week
that
she
has
asthma
.
As
a
result
,
I
’ve
moved
back
home
and
was
wondering
what
I
need
to
do
and
who
I
need
to
speak
to
in
order
to
defer
the
year
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
girl
,

I
’ve

na
be
participating
in
this
group
assessment

Good

Good
Afternoon
Romona
,
My
name
is
.
and
I
am
a
course
student
at
university
.
In
September
4890
I
began
my
final
year
of
studies
,
however
,
due
to
personal
reasons
I
had
to
defer
the
year
and
my
leave
of
absence
was
approved
in
August
9025
.
I
am
due
to
start
my
3rd
and
final
year
again
in
July
2514
.
Yet
despite
this
,
I
have
been
continuously
receiving
emails
about
submitting
assignments
for
the
2893
-
9459
academic
year
.
I
have
ignored
these
until
now
as
I
was
under
the
impression
that
they
did
not
apply
to
me
and
that
the
programme
office
was
aware
that
I
have
not
been
a
student
for
this
year
’s
studies
.
I
have
just
received
an
email
stating
that
my
group
assignment
submission
has
been
received
,
even
though
I
have
n’t
partaken
in
any
of
my
modules
.
I
am
worried
that
I
have
not
been
correctly
identified
on
your
systems
as
having
deferred
this
academic
year
,
and
therefore
have
been
marked
for
assignments
I
have
not
submitted
and
will
get
a
0
for
a
final
mark
.
Please
may
you
clarify
whether
this
is
just
a
system
error
and
that
I
do
not
need
to
worry
,
or
whether
my
leave
of
absence
has
not
been
properly
communicated
to
yourselves
and
something
has
gone
wrong
.
Thanks
in
advance

ld
be
worse
It
’s
not
yet
but
she
’s
been
sick
3
times
so
must
be
close
Yeah
they
empty
their
stomachs
Yeah
it
’s
gross
for
the
cleanup
crew
Aka
us
They
’ve
been
born
!
5
pups
,
less
than
last
time
4
boys
1
girl
this
time
They
’ve
just
got
back
from
the
vet
to
double
check
there
’s
none
left
inside
her
like
last
time
and
the
scan
showed
everything
was
good
So
excited
now
for
them
to
get
a
bit
bigger
Yeah
it
was
!
And
i
know
same
,
we
were
really
worried
that
something
was
going
wrong
because
only
5
had
come
out
so
we
thought
maybe
there
was
still
some
in
there
cause
she
had
more
last
time
them
from
Argos
Had
a
bit
of
a
mare
,
one
of
them
kept
crying
and
was
n’t
feeding
properly
and
then
early
this
morning
it
was
crying
literally
non
stop
so
took
them
to
the
vets
,
was
there
for
nearly
3
hours
We
thought
maybe
there
was
something
wrong
or
maybe
Wiatt
stepped
on
him
But
vet
thinks
it
’s
a
small
infection
probably
a
caused
by
the
umbilical
cord
,
so
he
’s
given
her
antibiotics
and
pain
killers
given
him
*
Hopefully
everything
will
be
alright
now
glad
it
was
n’t
anything
worse
Yeah
I
can
FaceTime
you
quickly

today
Nannette
,
I
am
a
second

year
course
student
and
I
have
a

about
the

in
December
.
The
topics
we
have
covered
this
year
include
:
topic
,
topic
,
topic
,

and

.
Our
50
%
coursework
assignment
was
on

,
does
this
mean
that
this
area
will
not
be
covered
in
the
summer
exam
?
Or
will
all

areas
be

Dear
Bryon
,
I
am
a
second
-
year
course
student
and
I
have
a
question
about
the
second
assignment
worth
30
%
of
the
module
module
.
I
understand
we
are
to
do
an
oral
presentation
and
submit
a
skeleton
argument
alongside
it
.
However
,
it
was
mentioned
in
one
of
the
lectures
that
the
skeleton
argument
is
due
nearly
a
month
before
the
oral
presentation
.
However
,
in
the
assignment
brief
it
states
that
the
skeleton
argument
is
due
on
the
2544
August
and
that
the
oral
presentation
will
take
place
the
week
after
.
This
is
contradictory
to
the
information
that
has
been
relayed
to
us
in
lectures
.
As
such
,
I
am
now
really
confused
about
the
assignment
,
how
it
is
split
up
and
when
it
is
due
.
Please
may
you
just
confirm
when
we
should
submit
the
skeleton
argument
and
the
oral
presentation
?
Thanks
,
Kind
Regards
..
Hi
April
,
Thanks
for
getting
back
to
me
.
I
saw
the
Exam
Preparation
folder
,
but
missed
the
announcement
on
it
.
I
have
just
read
it
and
it
has
answered
my
questions
.
Yes
,
I
do
have
difficulty
with
my
attendance
as
I
work
a
lot
in
order
to
fund
myself
through
university
.
However
,
I
do
most
of
my
uni
work
from
home
,
and
I
did
achieve
a
first
in
the
July
assignment
.
Therefore
,
my
attendance
is
n’t
affecting
my
results
or
my
place
on
this
course
.
I
do
apologise
if
you
had
to
repeat
yourself
on
the
exam
matter
,
I
can
understand
this
may
be
frustrating
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
Jeanne
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
getting
back
to
me
so
quickly
and
sending
through
the
letter

I
really
appreciate
it
and
am

able

complete

student

application
.
Kind

Hello
Team
,
Last
week
I
contacted
the
programme
office
about
my
leave
of
absence
.
I
spoke
to
someone
on
the
phone
and
explained
that
for
part
of
my
student
finance
application
for
the
next
academic
year
,
I
’m
required
to
send
them
proof
of
my
leave
of
absence
.
I
never
received
an
email
or
an
official
document
with
the
confirmation
of
my
leave
,
I
was
just
guided
to
system
where
it
stated
it
had
been
approved
.
However
,
I
can
not
send
student
finance
a
screenshot
of
the
page
and
was
hoping
someone
would
be
able
to
send
me
a
formal
letter
or
email
verifying
my
suspension
of
studies
.
No
one
has
gotten
back
to
me
yet
so
I
just
wanted
to
chase
it
up
.
My
student
number
is
2155
Thanks
in
advance
,
..
Hi
Fatima
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
actually
suspended
my
studies
back
in
November
since
finding
out
about
my
mum
’s
cancer
.
I
am
a
bit
concerned
because
I
have
already
spoken
to
the
programme
office
twice
now
about
the
fact
I
am
still
receiving
emails
from
university
about
submitting
assignments
and
completing
exams
that
I
am
not
supposed
to
be
taking
.
I
was
told
the
last
time
I
spoke
to
them
that
I
should
not
have
been
receiving
any
communications
about
my
studies
for
this
year
as
I
have
deferred
.
However
,
it
seems
that
this
issue
has
not
yet
been
resolved
as
I
am
still
being
sent
reminders
and
I
am
still
being
marked
0
on
assignments
in
my
provisional
assessment
results
on
system
.
I
will
once
again
contact
them
about
this
issue
,
but
just
to
confirm
I
am
not
a
current
student
for
the
24876726
academic
year
and
I
am
not
due
to
commence
my
studies
again
until
October
this
year
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Thank
you
for
having
visited
Thrills
and
Spills
LLP
this
morning
.
Can
you
make
a
wrongful
dismissal
claim
against
Wildlife
Wonders
?
Wrongful
dismissals
arise
when
an
employer
unjustifiably
breaches
one
or
more
fundamental
terms
in
an
employment
contract
,
resulting
in
an
employee
suffering
a
loss
of
benefits
.
To
be
eligible
to
claim
,
three
requirements
must
be
met
.
As
a
‘
Wildlife
Cameraman
’
for
Wildlife
Wonders
Limited
,
you
meet
the
first
element
of
being
an
employee
.
The
second
is
that
you
must
have
been
dismissed
.
An
employer
can
constructively
dismiss
an
employee
by
placing
them
in
a
position
where
they
can
no
longer
be
expected
to
tolerate
such
treatment
and
as
a
result
,
they
resign
.
To
successfully
argue
this
,
you
must
demonstrate
that
Wildlife
Wonders
committed
a
fundamental
breach
and
you
resigned
,
at
least
partly
,
in
response
to
it
.
Your
job
title
and
duties
as
a
Wildlife
Cameraman
were
reassigned
by
Narinder
,
without
a
consultation
-
this
variation
usually
requires
a
mutual
decision
.
Despite
remaining
in
accounting
for
6
months
,
your
reluctance
will
demonstrate
that
you
have
not
affirmed
or
accepted
this
change
and
that
Wildlife
Wonders
have
subsequently
breached
your
contract
.
There
is
also
a
duty
of
mutual
trust
and
confidence
implied
into
every
contract
.
A
mere
dispute
can
not
seriously
damage
the
relationship
between
both
parties
.
However
,
statements
,
such
as
Narinder
’s
disrespectful
and
humiliating
comments
at
the
award
ceremony
,
can
.
By
resigning
effective
immediately
the
morning
after
the
final
incident
,
you
can
emphasise
that
your
working
environment
was
intolerable
.
The
final
requirement
is
that
you
must
have
suffered
a
loss
by
not
receiving
all
of
the
benefits
you
were
entitled
to
,
as
a
consequence
of
Wildlife
Wonders
breaching
your
contract
.
If
your
contract
has
a
payment
in
lieu
of
notice
,
and
attempt
early
conciliation
.
An
additional
month
is
added
to
the
time
limit
in
order
to
allow
for
this
.
A
conciliation
officer
will
seek
to
promote
reemployment
or
a
settlement
between
you
and
Wildlife
Wonders
,
where
it
is
just
and
equitable
to
do
so
.
However
,
if
they
are
unable
to
resolve
the
issue
,
a
conciliation
certificate
will
be
issued
,
allowing
you
to
proceed
with
your
claim
in
a
tribunal
.
What
are
your
prospects
of
success
?
The
burden
is
on
you
to
prove
you
are
eligible
to
claim
wrongful
dismissal
.
There
is
no
defence
that
Wildlife
Wonders
can
depend
on
,
other
than
disproving
your
eligibility
.
Constructive
dismissal
can
be
difficult
to
prove
and
they
are
likely
to
challenge
this
element
.
The
legal
test
applied
is
whether
someone
in
the
same
position
as
yourself
,
would
view
Narinder
’s
actions
as
an
intention
to
abandon
the
contract
.
Considering
she
disregarded
your
job
title
and
duties
when
transferring
you
to
the
accounting
department
,
and
followed
it
with
no
discussion
or
explanation
,
it
would
be
fair
to
assume
this
intention
was
sufficiently
clear
.
A
court
or
tribunal
is
interested
in
what
triggered
your
resignation
.
The
‘
final
straw
’
you
mentioned
in
our
meeting
,
Narinder
disrespecting
and
publically
humiliating
you
,
will
be
the
focus
here
.
Alone
,
it
is
unlikely
to
be
sufficient
to
justify
your
resignation
.
However
,
you
’re
entitled
to
rely
on
the
totality
of
her
actions
.
Therefore
,
this
in
conjunction
to
her
variating
your
contract
terms
,
will
allow
you
to
succeed
in
a
wrongful
dismissal
claim
.
Your
prospects
with
an
unfair
dismissal
claim
will
depend
on
whether
Wildlife
Wonders
can
prove
the
reason
and
procedure
they
undertook
for
dismissal
was
fair
and
reasonable
.
As
I
mentioned
previously
,
your
inability
to
capture
decent
footage
over
the
last
2
-
3
years
,
could
be
accepted
as
a
fair
reason
.
The
size
and
administrative
resources
of
the
company
will
be
relevant
to
the
outcome
,
as
their
loss
of
confidence
in
your
abilities
could
be
consequently
seen
as
a
fair
response
.
Despite
this
,
small
companies
are
not
excused
from
following
proper
procedures
.
Moreover
,
If
Narinder
was
dissatisfied
with
your
capabilities
,
then
she
should
have
followed
ACAS
guidelines
on
how
to
address
the
problem
.
Instead
,
she
repeatedly
avoided
and
ignored
your
requests
for
explanations
.
As
such
,
it
is
likely
that
Wildlife
Wonders
will
successfully
argue
their
reason
for
dismissal
as
being
fair
,
however
,
they
will
struggle
to
convince
a
tribunal
that
their
procedure
was
reasonable
.
What
are
your
options
and
what
are
the
advantagesdisadvantages
of
pursing
each
one
?
Option
1
:
Apply
to
ACAS
and
seek
a
settlement
The
advantages
include
saving
the
time
,
aggravation
and
cost
of
claiming
.
You
will
also
,
hopefully
,
be
listened
to
by
Wildlife
Wonders
and
have
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
on
the
matters
most
important
to
you
,
for
instance
the
company
car
.
The
disadvantages
are
that
a
settlement
might
not
be
reached
and
you
will
have
to
endure
the
process
of
claiming
on
top
of
adhering
to
the
early
conciliation
process
.
Furthermore
,
you
may
inadvertently
reveal
your
deep
interest
in
the
company
car
to
your
hindrance
.
Option
2
:
Claim
wrongful
dismissal
The
advantages
include
receiving
-
without
having
to
earn
them
-
all
benefits
you
’d
have
received
had
you
worked
your
notice
period
.
The
disadvantages
are
the
cost
and
aggravation
of
claiming
and
being
out
of
work
with
no
regular
salary
,
coupled
with
the
stress
of
seeking
alternative
employment
.
Option
3
:
Claim
unfair
dismissal
The
advantages
are
the
same
as
for
option
2
,
but
you
may
also
be
offered
reemployment
,
which
would
save
the
loss
of
salary
and
stress
of
seeking
alternative
employment
during
a
pandemic
.
The
disadvantages
are
the
same
as
for
option
2
.
My
considered
advice
re
the
best
option
I
feel
option
3
would
be
the
most
beneficial
to
you
,
as
this
is
where
you
’ll
be
best
compensated
for
your
current
circumstances
.
However
,
it
is
crucial
that
you
reflect
and
make
this
decision
yourself
.
What
remedies
are
available
to
you
for
wrongful
dismissal
?
Three
types
of
remedies
are
available
to
a
successful
wrongful
dismissal
claimant
–
I
believe
the
one
most
relevant
to
you
is
financial
compensation
.
You
will
be
restored
to
the
position
you
would
have
been
in
,
had
Wildlife
Wonders
performed
their
contractual
obligations
.
Only
the
losses
that
are
reasonably
foreseeable
can
be
recovered
.
A
tribunal
’s
award
for
wrongful
dismissal
is
capped
at
£
25,000
.
This
is
something
to
keep
in
mind
when
deciding
which
venue
to
initiate
a
claim
in
.
You
will
be
compensated
for
all
of
the
benefits
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
,
had
you
worked
their
notice
period
.
Your
contract
offers
you
only
8
weeks
’
notice
,
however
,
you
are
legally
entitled
to
10
.
For
loss
of
salary
,
Wildlife
Wonders
will
be
ordered
to
pay
10
-
weeks
’
worth
of
your
net
pay
-
£
10,000
.
For
your
untaken
holiday
,
you
will
be
paid
in
lieu
£
4,000
.
I
will
be
consulting
a
pension
specialist
to
estimate
the
value
of
your
pension
entitlement
.
As
you
have
access
to
a
final
salary
pension
scheme
,
you
will
be
compensated
generously
.
This
is
because
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
new
employment
offering
this
comprehensive
package
.
You
wo
n’t
be
compensated
for
benefits
that
your
employer
is
not
contractually
obliged
to
provide
.
Yet
,
you
may
still
be
entitled
to
your
Christmas
bonus
,
despite
the
word
‘
discretionary
’
being
used
in
the
clause
.
I
understand
you
would
like
to
retain
possession
of
the
company
Land
Rover
.
Were
the
weekend
trips
you
described
for
personal
or
work
purposes
?
If
you
can
prove
you
used
the
vehicle
in
your
private
life
,
then
you
might
be
able
to
keep
it
.
I
would
advise
you
not
to
reveal
to
Wildlife
Wonders
your
strong
desire
to
keep
the
car
,
or
this
will
be
used
against
you
during
negotiations
.
Unfortunately
,
no
award
is
issued
for
injury
to
feelings
or
for
the
manner
in
which
you
were
dismissed
,
even
though
Narinder
shaming
you
in
front
of
industry
professionals
might
make
it
harder
for
you
to
get
another
job
.
What
remedies
are
available
to
you
for
unfair
dismissal
?
A
tribunal
could
make
you
an
order
for
reengagement
.
I
am
aware
that
you
are
adamant
you
will
never
work
for
them
again
and
a
tribunal
would
not
recommend
this
remedy
if
it
is
likely
to
promote
further
issues
.
However
,
there
is
no
harm
in
knowing
all
of
the
options
available
to
you
.
Under
this
order
,
you
would
be
offered
suitable
or
comparable
employment
to
what
you
had
prior
to
your
dismissal
.
Should
you
wish
,
you
could
resume
your
previous
position
as
‘
Wildlife
Cameraman
’
.
Non
-
compliance
by
Wildlife
Wonders
,
allows
the
tribunal
to
increase
your
award
by
up
to
25
%
.
Financial
compensation
for
unfair
dismissal
consists
of
a
basic
and
a
compensatory
award
that
are
summed
together
.
The
basic
award
is
a
precise
figure
and
compensates
you
for
the
loss
of
job
security
.
In
your
case
,
the
total
amount
a
tribunal
will
offer
you
here
is
£
6,456
.
For
the
compensatory
award
,
tribunals
determine
what
would
be
fair
to
award
a
successful
claimant
by
assessing
any
loss
deriving
from
the
employer
’s
actions
in
the
dismissal
.
You
can
not
receive
an
amount
higher
than
your
gross
salary
,
thus
,
the
maximum
amount
available
to
you
for
this
compensation
element
is
£
78,000
.
You
will
be
compensated
for
the
immediate
loss
of
benefits
you
are
entitled
to
receive
,
between
the
dismissal
and
the
date
of
the
hearing
.
The
current
wait
time
is
roughly
38
-
weeks
,
and
it
’ll
likely
rise
due
to
the
Covid-19
crisis
.
This
will
subsequently
increase
the
value
of
your
award
.
Your
future
loss
is
also
calculated
for
the
period
between
the
end
of
your
notice
period
and
the
time
it
takes
you
to
find
new
employment
.
A
tribunal
will
likely
compensate
you
for
a
considerable
amount
of
time
,
as
the
current
pandemic
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
find
new
employment
.
The
same
calculations
as
wrongful
dismissal
applies
here
,
for
your
bonus
and
other
fringe
benefits
.
Although
,
your
pension
value
will
additionally
encompass
both
the
loss
of
your
current
position
,
and
the
loss
of
future
pension
opportunity
.
As
such
,
you
’ll
receive
a
higher
pension
amount
for
unfair
dismissal
.
Furthermore
,
should
your
employer
fail
to
follow
ACAS
,
an
increase
of
up
to
25
%
could
be
made
to
the
value
of
your
award
.
Similarly
,
if
you
fail
to
do
so
,
then
up
to
25
%
can
be
deducted
.
In
addition
,
if
Wildlife
Wonders
fail
to
make
payment
within
42
days
of
an
order
being
issued
,
interest
be
payable
on
all
tribunal
awards
,
further
increasing
your
total
compensation
amount
.
You
have
an
obligation
to
take
steps
to
lessen
and
reduce
the
loss
you
accumulate
as
a
result
of
your
dismissal
from
Wildlife
Wonders
.
I
therefore
encourage
you
to
make
a
real
effort
in
seeking
alternative
employment
and
keep
a
record
of
all
job
applications
and
responses
.
You
’re
not
expected
to
accept
less
favourable
terms
,
unless
you
’re
unemployed
for
a
considerable
amount
of
time
,
in
which
case
it
reasonable
to
accept
an
inferior
position
.
You
can
recover
any
expenses
reasonably
incurred
in
mitigating
your
loss
;
this
includes
the
cost
of
newspapers
to
search
for
jobs
,
and
even
the
cost
of
relocating
.
Needless
to
say
,
please
keep
your
receipts
.
If
Wildlife
Wonders
can
convince
a
tribunal
that
the
dismissal
was
to
any
extent
caused
by
you
,
then
a
deduction
will
be
made
.
Tribunals
will
take
a
broad
,
common
sense
view
when
assessing
this
deduction
,
and
your
poor
performance
is
unlikely
to
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
necessary
culpable
or
blameworthy
element
.
Other
information
I
feel
is
relevant
It
would
be
helpful
if
you
could
email
me
a
copy
of
your
contract
,
so
that
I
can
check
any
further
benefits
you
may
be
entitled
to
.
I
will
also
need
to
confirm
whether
or
not
there
is
a
PILON
clause
,
which
would
prevent
you
from
claiming
wrongful
dismissal
.
In
the
meantime
,
you
need
to
check
with
Wildlife
Wonders
’
HR
department
to
see
if
you
have
opted
out
of
the
working
time
regulations
.
If
you
have
,
you
’ll
forfeit
your
entitlement
to
untaken
holiday
and
your
compensation
amount
will
be
reduced
.
Please
email
or
write
to
Wildlife
Wonders
confirming
your
resignation
and
the
reasons
for
it
.
I
stress
that
no
further
action
can
be
embarked
on
until
you
have
taken
this
step
.
Failure
to
do
so
will
invalidate
any
claim
available
to
you
,
as
you
will
not
have
been
properly
constructively
dismissed
.
If
you
wish
to
discuss
any
questions
,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
telephone
me
.
I
will
contact
you
at
the
end
of
next
week
,
on
Friday
,
to
discuss
further
instructions
after
you
have
had
time
to
reflect
.

if
there

This

I
was
diagnosed
with
flu
last
week
and
I
've
unfortunately
been
quite
unwell
.
My
worst
symptom
is
the
exhaustion

means
that
small

tire
me
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
I
have
a

exam
released
tomorrow
which
I
feel
prepared
enough
to
do

I
would
like
to
defer
my

released
next

.
I
ca
n't
seem
to
find
any
of
the

or
guidance
sent
which
explain
the
procedure
for
deferring
or
if

Second

Dear
Dr
Welby
,
I
am
just
emailing
regarding
some
advice
for
the
June
exams
.
I
was
diagnosed
with
asthma
last
week
and
I
've
unfortunately
been
quite
unwell
.
My
worst
symptom
is
the
exhaustion
which
means
that
small
activities
tire
me
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
I
would
like
to
defer
my

exam
released
next
week
as
I
have
not
been
well
enough
to
do
any
work
for
it
and
do
n't
think
I
will
be
able
to
perform
to
my
best
potential
.
I
understand
there
is
automatic
deferral
in
circumstances
,
but
I
am
unsure
if
I
still
need
to
fill
in
an
organisation
form
or
let
anyone
know

I
have
emailed
my
personal

who
recommended
emailing
a

the

to
let

find
out
any

I
will
be
grateful
for
any

Second
year
undergraduate
course
student
Both
the
biological
and
psychoanalytic
approaches
seek
to
explain
human
behaviour
.
The
biological
approach
proposes
the
idea
that
all
psychological
problems
are
rooted
in
physiological
causes
,
whereas
the
psychoanalytic
approach
suggests
that
behaviour
is
due
to
unconscious
forces
and
childhood
experiences
.
The
key
features
of
these
approaches
are
distinct
from
each
other
and
have
their
uses
and
limitations
,
yet
,
both
are
still
widely
used
in
psychology
.
The
biological
approach
prevails
over
other
psychological
approaches
due
to
the
fact
that
its
explanations
encompass
anatomy
,
physiology
and
the
role
of
neurological
function
.
This
approach
accepts
the
idea
of
materialism
as
it
assumes
that
all
behaviour
has
a
physical
basis
.
This
opposes
the
previously
accepted
idea
of
dualism
,
in
which
it
was
believed
that
the
body
and
the
mind
are
separate
but
interacting
entities
.
The
shift
from
dualism
to
materialism
was
supported
with
work
by
Paul
Broca
conducted
a
randomised
control
trial
and
assessed
outcome
measures
such
as
number
of
admissions
,
frequency
of
suicide
attempts
and
symptom
distress
.
There
was
a
well
-
structured
methodological
approach
to
this
study
,
including
the
use
of
DSM
-
III
-
R
criteria
to
assess
for
BPD
before
participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
the
two
groups
.
This
study
is
an
example
of
how
the
psychoanalytic
approach
should
not
be
completely
disregarded
as
non
-
scientific
as
current
research
looks
to
improve
the
legitimacy
of
methods
that
are
used
.
In
conclusion
,
the
biological
and
the
psychoanalytic
approach
parallel
each
other
in
terms
of
their
determinism
and
their
perspective
on
nature
.
However
,
the
biological
approach
has
an
advantage
over
the
psychoanalytic
approach
as
it
is
empirical
and
has
a
strong
scientific
basis
which
supports
its
credibility
.
The
early
concepts
of
the
psychoanalytic
approach
are
difficult
to
falsify
but
on
the
other
hand
,
contemporary
psychoanalytic
research
has
since
developed
to
include
more
rigorous
scientific
procedures
.
Despite
issues
with
both
approaches
,
key
features
have
their
place
in
psychology
today
with
localisation
of
brain
function
,
the
action
of
neurotransmitters
and
unconscious
cognitive
processes
still
being
widely
accepted
.

Dear
SirMadam
,
I
am
emailing
in
regard
to
student
finance
funding
for
a
placement
year
and
afterwards
for
my
4th
year
of
study
.
I
previously
attended
university
in
7543
but
dropped
out
at
Christmas
.
According
to
student
finance
this
counts
as
whole
year
of
study
and
as
far
as
I
am
aware
,
they
only
fund
four
years
of
study
.
I
am
just
raising
a
query
for
how
this
would
work
if
I
chose
to
take
a
placement
year
as
this
would
extend
my
total
university
time
to
5
years
by
the
end
of
4th
year
.
Will
student
finance
fund
my
placement
year
if
it
is
unpaid
?
In
addition
to
this
my
main
concern
is
to
whether
they
would
fund
the
tution
and
maintenance
loan
for
my
4th
year
of
my
course
at
university
.
If
you
have
any
more
information
on
the
subject
or
know
of
where
I
can
find
more
information
please
let
me
know
.
Best
Wishes
,
.
y
I
can
see
if
I
can
pick
some
up
on
the
way
,
will
aim
to
be
at
yours
for
6
and
let
me
know
when
you
’re
on
the
bus
home
:)
x
See
you
tomorrow
At
Rickey
’s
house
x
went
out
in
Pheonix
with
his
friends
last
night
so
stayed
today
will
see
you
tomorrow
x
Washed
my
hair
this
morning
and
it
’s
so
much
worse
than
yesterday
,
loads
of
bits
at
the
back
have
snapped
off
from
the
bleach
and
the
colour
is
all
over
the
place
.
Going
to
ask
for
a
refund
and
Modesty
’s
asked
his
hairdresser
at
business
if
he
can
try
to
save
it
🙄
will
be
fine
like
you
’ve
said
and
does
n’t
look
so
bad
in
photos
or
anything
so
idm
just
looking
after
it
until
I

Introduction
The
non
-
binary
gender
movement
is
seen
as
a
relatively
new
phenomenon
due
to
increased
activism
in
the
years
2015
and
2016
.
This
demonstrates
that
ignorance
may
be
fuelling
negative
social
attitudes
and
education
could
lead
to
a
change
.
Permanence
of
Societal
Views
Anna
used
language
which
implied
varying
degrees
of
permanence
to
current
views
.
Some
societal
views
were
constructed
as
being
temporary
and
some
were
constructed
as
being
concrete
and
resistant
to
change
.
This
quote
was
referring
to
the
use
of
discrete
categories
for
clothing
in
dress
stores
.
By
using
the
phrase
"
it
does
n’t
have
to
be
"
Anna
acknowledges
that
there
is
room
for
improvement
of
societal
attitudes
.
She
suggests
that
if
there
was
a
large
-
scale
change
for
example
by
a
clothing
company
,
then
people
would
be
relieved
from
the
binary
which
would
increase
open
-
mindedness
.
This
is
juxtaposed
by
the
phrase
"
but
it
very
much
is
"
which
is
contradicting
to
the
original
message
.
This
implies
that
while
there
is
the
opportunity
for
enhancing
the
lives
of
others
,
there
is
a
lack
of
drive
.
This
negative
outlook
suggests
that
individuals
in
society
are
focused
on
keeping
the
superiority
of
their
own
ingroup
,
at
the
cost
of
the
well
-
being
of
the
non
-
binary
out
group
.
Anna
used
the
phrase
"
at
the
moment
"
5
times
during
the
course
of
the
interview
.
This
was
used
when
comparing
non
-
binary
activism
to
various
social
movements
such
as
feminism
,
gender
equality
and
Black
Lives
Matter
.
By
using
words
such
as
"
minute
"
and
"
moment
"
,
social
movements
are
perceived
to
be
current
and
short
natured
.
This
may
show
that
years
of
activism
go
unnoticed
by
society
if
it
does
not
benefit
the
majority
.
By
constructing
language
in
this
way
,
Anna
demonstrates
how
society
is
only
able
to
comprehend
one
change
at
a
time
.
Feminism
is
the
sole
focus
and
only
when
this
is
achieved
,
will
non
-
binary
issues
take
the
forefront
.
Anna
also
uses
the
word
"
they
"
when
talking
about
equality
.
This
choice
of
word
removes
responsibility
from
herself
for
actioning
change
.
This
suggests
that
only
certain
people
hold
this
power
,
potentially
only
those
in
authority
.
This
stance
would
explain
why
non
-
binary
progression
in
society
is
slow
as
it
reflects
the
belief
that
not
everyone
is
in
the
position
to
make
a
difference
.
People
either
do
not
recognise
that
they
could
be
valuable
allies
in
fighting
for
queer
rights
,
or
they
do
not
believe
it
is
their
place
.
By
using
language
like
this
,
Anna
is
recognising
that
non
-
binary
individuals
are
not
considered
to
have
achieved
equality
in
society
.
To
Conclude
In
deconstructing
the
language
used
by
Anna
to
describe
non
-
binary
people
,
a
main
negative
attitude
prevailed
which
may
be
due
to
a
lack
of
understanding
.
Discourses
constructed
non
-
binary
individuals
as
being
distinctly
different
to
the
interviewee
and
identifying
this
way
by
choice
.
Social
attitudes
were
also
constructed
as
having
varying
permanence
.
The
inconsistencies
uncovered
reflect
that
there
may
be
diverse
social
attitudes
towards
non
-
binary
individuals
.

Dear
Ms
,
I
have
organised
an
itinerary
for
your
upcoming
trip
to
Helsinki
on
the
2nd
to
the
4th
of
September
.
Your
hotel
is
the
Hotel
Haven
which
is
located
on
Unioninkatu
17
,
near
the
south
harbour
and
is
a
3
minute
walk
to
the
Market
Square
.
This
is
at
a
cost
of
Â£157
per
night
.
You
will
be
dining
at
Cafe
Roasberg
for
breakfast
which
is
located
on
Mikonkatu
13
.
Next
,
the
Helsinki
City
Museum
will
allow
you
to
look
at
the
history
of
Helsinki
.
This
is
on
Aleksanterinkatu
16
.
In
order
to
purchase
traditional
souvenirs
,
I
would
direct
you
to
Shop
Helsinki
-
Mikebon
which
is
on
Simonkatu
9
.
For
dinner
,
you
will
be
eating
at
Restaurant
Lappi
which
is
on
Annankatu
22
.
They
serve
the
national
dish
which
is
sautÃ
©
ed
reindeer
.
Finally
for
the
evening
,
there
is
a
live
music
venue
called
On
the
Rocks
which
have
live
music
every
night
from
different
global
bands
.
This
is
located
on
Mikonkatu
15
.
All
items
in
the
itinerary
are
within
walking
distance
of
the
hotel
,
up
to
15
minutes
,
but
there
is
the
option
to
take
a
short
journey
on
public
transport
if
looking
to
instead
.
I
wish
you
a
good
trip
.
Kind
regards
,
Olivia
James
t
’s
what
I
said

Hair
dresser
said
she
’ll
refund
me
for
the
colour

tried
to
say
that
the
breakage
was
me
brushing
my
hair
in
the
morning
when
it
just
was
n’t
😂
got
to
wait
4
-
5
weeks
before
putting
any
more
colour
on
top
so
got
to
use
loads
of
hair
masks
in
between
then
essaged
her
last
night
about
the
colour

Hi
Lee
,
I
am
just
emailing
regarding
some
advice
for
the
December
exams
.
I
was
diagnosed
with
hypothermia
last
week
and
I
've
unfortunately
been
quite
unwell
.
My
worst
symptom
is
the
exhaustion
which
means
that
small
activities
tire
me
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
I
have
a
module
exam
released
tomorrow
which
I
feel
prepared
enough
to
do
but
I
would
like
to
defer
my
module
exam
released
next
week
.
I
ca
n't
seem
to
find
any
of
the
emails
or
guidance
sent
which
explain
the
procedure
for
deferring
or
if
I
need
to
submit
any
forms
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
any
advice
or
knew
of
the
procedure
as
I
would
appreciate
the
help
.

Wishes

Hi
guys
I
've
just
checked
the
groups
on
system
and
we
're
all
together
for
the
topic
task
.
Not
sure
if
you
wanted
to
set
up
a
whatsapp
group
so
we
can
discuss
there
and
set
up
maybe
doing
a
zoom
meeting
later
at
some
point
.
My
number
is
2587
if
you
want
to
add
me
and
send
me
a
message
with
your
name
so
we
can
get
a
group
started
🙂

they
said
my

any
more
colour

I
have
to
wait
So
gon
na
wait
5
weeks
or
so
and
then
see
if
another
hair
salon
can
maybe
do
a
little
bit
to
even
out
the

invest
in

Hi
Basil

My
apologies
I
was
just
trying
to
work
out
when
would
be
best
for
me
to
order
it

around
my
workload
.
I
will
put
the
order
in
today

hopefully
be
able
to
renew
it
afterwards

I
was
also
wondering
roughly
how
long
it
usually
take
for
the
textbook
to
arrive
?
Many
thanks
for
all
your
help

Hello
,
I
am
interested
in
the
linguistics
course
at
the
university
.
I
have
just
completed
a
years
placement
at
the
organisation
and
am
now
entering
my
final
year
of
studies
for
computer
science
at
university
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
would
be
able
to
provide
me
with
some
guidance
on
the
entry
requirements
for
this
course
.
I
have
attached
the
latest
copy
of
my
results
transcript
but
am
concerned
that
some
of
my
grades
may
not
be
high
enough
.
90
of
the
120
credits
for
my
final
year
are
subject
focused
.
I
would
appreciate
any
guidance
you
are
able
to
give
me
in
this
matter
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Bryce
,
I
'm
a
final
year
student
so
unfortunately
can
not
provide
you
with
all
the
help
you
need-
however
I
will
do
my
best
to
help
you
solve
these
issues
.
To
discuss
module
changes
you
should
contact
the
organisation
.
I
believe
the
best
email
to
use
is
:
email_address
In
regards
to
the
placement
year
,
as
far
as
I
'm
aware
this
is
a
compulsory
component
for
all
undergraduate
organisation
students
,
with
the
exception
of
international
students
.
Therefore
,
removing
this
from
your
degree
would
depend
upon
your
situation
.
I
understand
your
concerns
around
a
placement
year
especially
in
the
current
climate
however
,
having
just
completed
my
own
placement
year
I
can
not
recommend
it
enough
!
It
really
does
stand
out
to
employers
on
graduate
job
applications
and
the
experiences
it
provides
are
above
and
beyond
the
skills
you
will
gain
through
a
degree
alone
.
Hope
this
helps
,
.
Hi
Jennette
,
Unfortunately
,
I
do
n't
take
module
and
I
'm
not
aware
of
any
study
groups
for
this
module
.
I
do
n't
know
anyone
who
takes
the
module
to
ask
them
either
I
'm
affriad
.
The
other
student
rep
Teodoro
,
email_address
might
take
the
module
so
it
could
be
worth
asking
him
too
!
Sorry
for
not
being
much
help
!

Rational
choice
theory
‘
deals
with
the
way
in
which
scarcity
impinges
upon
the
individual
consumer
and
hence
deals
with
the
way
in
which
such
an
individual
makes
choices
’
.
This
evidence
shows
that
consumers
are
responsive
to
behavioural
economic
policies
and
therefore
do
not
always
act
like
Homo
Economicus
as
suggested
by
the
rational
choice
model
.
Overall
,
rational
choice
theory
suggests
that
unconditional
cash
transfers
are
more
effective
at
raising
consumers
’
utility
.
It
allows
consumers
to
purchase
the
goods
and
services
they
decide
will
maximise
their
own
utility
.
However
,
in
the
long
run
,
depending
upon
the
area
of
consumption
being
targeted
in
-
kind
transfers
may
be
more
beneficial
for
raising
overall
welfare
.
For
example
,
the
healthy
food
vouchers
provide
families
with
food
of
a
higher
quality
and
that
is
more
beneficial
to
their
health
.
If
they
were
instead
provided
with
cash
,
as
the
distorted
consumer
example
shows
,
there
is
a
chance
that
this
money
would
not
be
spend
on
healthy
foods
and
instead
it
may
be
used
to
purchase
fast
food
alternatives
.
This
is
then
likely
to
have
a
long
-
term
impact
on
health
and
could
contribute
to
strains
on
the
healthcare
system
in
the
future
.
If
unconditional
cash
transfers
are
to
be
used
,
behavioural
economic
approaches
can
be
adopted
to
influence
how
consumers
spend
this
money
to
enable
the
intervention
to
have
the
most
desired
impact
.

Hello
,
I
am
currently
on
my
placement
year
and
it
has
n't
been
exactly
what
I
expected
.
Therefore
,
I
would
like
to
look
into
possible
summer
opportunities
that
I
could
take
up
from
around
mid
July
.
How
am
I
best
to
go
about
finding
a
summer
internship
?
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
a
list
of
employers
who
typically
offer
these
types
of
schemes
.
Also
,
is
it
too
late
to
apply
to
these
schemes
?
Is
there
a
time
when
larger
companies
all
close
applications
?
How
would
I
narrow
down
the
opportunities
listed
on
system
to
Summer
placements
only
?
Scrolling
through
I
can
mostly
see
Graduate
opportunities
.
Many
thanks
in
advanced
for
your
help

Hi
Delia
,
Today
we
received
details
about
final
year
modules
.
module
was
not
on
the
list
for
course
.
Is
the
module
still
running
?
If
so
who
could
I
ask
about
possibly
taking
this
module
?
Thanks
,
.
Dear
Dorita
,
That
's
really
helpful
thank
you
.
I
wo
n't
have
any
problems
getting
the
reading
done
beforehand
so
all
sounds
good
!
I
do
n't
think
the
Policy
document
attachment
has
come
through
;
would
you
be
able
to
resend
this
?
I

it
would
be

Dear
Rustin
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
I
can
confirm
that
I
am
able
to
help
at
the
Periodic
Review
on
5781
September
.
My
only
concern
would
be
the
pre
-
meeting
.
I
am
a
placement
student
and
am
currently
based
in
Chicago
.
I
would
be
able
to
dial
-
in
to
a
meeting
at
anytime
or
attend
in
person
if
it
was
to
be
held
on
504
October
.
I
can
try
and
be
as
flexible
as
possible
with
this
but
would
find
it
much
easier
to
attend
if
it
was
held
the
day
before
the
review
.
Hopefully
we
would
be
able
to
make
this
work
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
more
form
you
.

Dear

I
hope

your
conference

my
findings
for
the
trips
itinerary

Budget
of
Â£200
per
night
The
'
Hotel
Haven
'
is
located
by
the
harbour
and
totals
Â£352
for
the
2
night
stay
.
It
has
a
central
location
making
the
city
centre
easily
accessible
.
Breakfast
Cafe
:
The
'
Brooklyn
Cafe
"
is
noted
as
a
breakfast
highlight
in
Helsinki
.
Museum
:
The
'
Helsinki
City
Museum
'
documents
and
displays
the
history
of
Helsinki
.
Traditional
Evening
Meal
:
The
national
dish
of
Finland
is
'

'
which
is
a
sautÃ
©
ed
Reindeer
dish

Evening
Entertainment
:
Many
bars
in

appear
to
offer
a
lively
atmosphere
and
some
opportunities
for
watching
live
music
.
Some
suggestions
include
:
Ateljee
Bar
,
Azl
Helsinki
OY
and
Bar
Bakkari
.
However
,
for
the
best
live
music
options
,
you
may
wish
to
look
around
on
the
day
and
see
what
is
being
advertised

these
suggestions
fit
well
to
what
you
had
in
mind
.

not

Hi
Brett

Just
thought
I
’d
email
to
remind
you
to
sort
my
placement
tutor
out
.
I
do
n’t
think
they
’ve
approved
my
placement
on
system
yet
either
but
I
’ve
given
them
all
the
information
they
need
.
.
Hi
,
My
line
manager
emailed
you
last
week
explaining
why
this
has
n't
yet
been
submitted
.
We
are
awaiting
on
HR
to
provide
the
name
of
the
insurer
and
the
policy
number
and
will
send
over
the
completed
form
once
we
have
received
this
.
Kind
regards
,

Bel

I
said

Of

You

About

a
degree
in
the
history
of
that
sport
club
based
on
how

crap
he
sends
😂
😂
Cathlene
,
No
problem
at
all
.
I
’ll
continue
with
next
weeks
workshop
.
.
We
run
workshops
every
2
weeks
teaching
a
range
of
topic
topics
and
skills
to
use
when
completing
numerical
reasoning
tests
for
placement
and
graduate
roles
.
We
've
taught
a
range
of
students
from
1st
year
undergraduates
through
to
masters
students
.
We
try
to
use
interactive
activities
where
possible
such
as
group
tasks
and
kahoots
.
We
prepare
slides
and
worksheets
in
advance
and
offer
1
to
1
support
for
students
who
are
struggling
with
questions
at
the
end
of
the
workshop
.
Hope
this
helps
🙂
Also
can
you
let
me
know
when
you
have
our
module
papers
back
so
I
can
have
a
look
at
mine
again
?

See

tips

and
also
uploaded
them

If
my
placement
could
be
approved
this
week
it
would
help
me
massively
with
my
student
system
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Jeniffer
,
That
's
great
thank
you
!
Are
you
able
to
inform
Tobe
or
whoever
else
is
relevant
to
allow
them
to
sort
my
student
system
application
?
I
only
have
the
general
placement
email
to
contact
in
regards
to
this
but
could
do
with
my
application
being
complete
as
soon
as
possible
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Avrit
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
thought
I
would
contact
you
to
organise
the
initial
placement
year
meeting
and
provide
you
with
my
placement
information
.
I
am
based
in
at
organisation
's
office
in
the
building
:
8663
road
,
San
Antonio
6022
;
not
the
building
address
as
listed
on
my
system
account
.
My
line
manager
is
Karil
and
his
email
address
is
email_address
.
With
regards
to
the
initial
meeting
,
I
am
on
leave
from
3215
-
3660
July
and
a
few
days
over
the
Christmas
period
.
I
am
happy
to
arrange
the
meeting
virtually
but
am
also
able
to
visit
university
if
this
is
easier
.
I
usually
work
from
home
on
either
Sunday
's
or
Tuesday
's
and
travel
back
to
New
York
City
regularly
.
Please
let
me
know
if
there
are
any
more
placement
details
you
need
from
me
and
when
it
would
be
convenient
to
arrange
the
meeting
.
Best
wishes
,
.
Hi
,
No
problem
!
I
can
check
about
the
3514
and
let
you
know
but
I
think
it
should
be
ok
.
4986
in
San
Jose
would
also
work
for
me
.
I
think
the
guidance
suggests
that
a
visit
to
meet
my
managers
etc
happens
at
the
start
of
the
new
year
.
I
would
try
and
arrange
all
of
this
for
some
point
in
June
but
people
are
going
on
leave
then
so
I
’m
not
sure
who
will
actually
be
around
!
.
Hi
Odessa
,
Friday
5396
July
would
work
best
for
me
but
I
appreciate
that
is
very
close
to
Christmas
.
I
might
also
be
able
to
do
the
2415
but
would
need
to
get
this
checked
when
my
manager
is
back
off
leave
.
Do
either
of
these
dates
work
for
you
?
Thanks
,
.
o
I
know
the
weathers
a
bit
shit
but
mums

with
us
being

later
so
we
’ll

the

Immigration
refers
to
‘
the
process
by
which
people
come
in
to
a
foreign
country
to
live
’
events
such
as
BREXIT
and
increased
protectionism
by
other
nations
may
affect
these
in
the
future
.
The
UK
in
general
benefits
from
immigration
by
receiving
a
larger
workforce
and
therefore
greater
tax
revenues
.
The
main
costs
to
the
UK
results
from
the
increased
populations
effect
upon
public
services
.
As
the
UK
is
a
developed
economy
,
it
receives
a
greater
benefit
from
immigration
of
workers
who
can
fill
skills
gaps
and
aid
productivity
.
ess
you
have
my
birth
certificate
easily
accessible
?
X
Or
I
can
use
a
P45
or
P60
from
the
last
12
months-
I
think
I
have
one
from
when
I
left
organisation
x
It
says
mobile
phone
bills
are
n’t
acceptable
I
’ve
just
looked
x
👍

thank
you
x
Will
sort
it
when
I
get
home-
I
’m
sat
in
the
office
doing
work
at
the
minute
x
What
does
it
mean
issued
12
months
after
birth
?
I
’m
assuming
it
should
say
‘
up
to
12
months
after
birth
’
x
It
’s
very
confusing-
not
sure
how
I
managed
to
get
through
this
part
before
!
!
X
👍

I
’m
just
about
to
head
home
from
Sainsbury
’s
x
They
’re
coming
this
afternoon

She
’s
going
to
let
me
know
what
time
when
her
husband
knows
what
time
he
’s
finishing
work
x
Have
I
had
any
post
today
?
They
rejected
my
bank
statement
because
they
did
n’t
check
it
until
today
and
it
’s
out
of
the
3
month
period
now
🙃
x
I
’ll
email
and
ask
because
I
do
nt
have
anything
else
to
send
them
x
I
do
n’t
have
a
more
recent
bank
statement
and
they
rejected
the
online
version
and
I
do
n’t
have
any
bills
registered
to
home
unless
they
will
accept
an
online
phone
bill
x
Thank
you
!
I
’m
not
there
tonight
unfortunately

Hi
Canada
,
I
'm
not
too
sure
if
you
'll
remember
me
but
I
completed
my
gold
award
and
received
it
in
September
this
year
through
organisation
.
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
yesterday
I
attended
location
to
assist
with
the
gold
award
presentations
.
I
hosted
VIP
's
and
was
also
given
the
opportunity
to
hand
out
awards
and
had
a
nice
conversation
with
the
Duke
of
Wessex
.
It
would
be
great
if
I
could
let
Mackenzie
know
that
I
've
carried
on
supporting
the
organisation
where
possible
so
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
a
contact
I
could
use
to
let
him
know
?
Thanks
!

another
2
hours
whenever

Hi
Friedrick
,
I
've
asked
my
friend
who
's
a
1st
year
course
student
about
the
mentor
application
email
.
She
's
double
checked
and
said
she
definitely
has
n't
received
it
.
Her
degrees
split
between
organisation
and
organisation
so
I
'm
assuming
she
's
not
had
anything
from
either
school
.
.
k
at
this
lmao
Yep
😂
😂
😂
On
a
team
post
It
’s
hilarious
And
it
’s
a
super
old
photo
for
sure
Exactly
Stealing
the
limelight
I
apologies
for
my
mother
😂
😂
😂
😂
Yes

I
finish
uni
on
Sunday
So
was
going
to
suggest

do
something
ASAP
!
!
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕

I
’m
not
completely
sure
as
I
’m
going
to
cover
a
few
shifts
at
work
so
I
’ll
find
out
tomorrow
what
they
are
!
We
can
plan
then
if
that
’s
ok
?
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
💕
Perfect
!
I
’m
off
work
this
week
so
I
’m
clueless
about
what
days
off
we
both
have
and
normally
I
know
it
all
so
I
can
plan
😂
😂
💕
💕

ctly

We
just
want

not
have
a

Yesss

for
Friday-
we
can
do
it
at
mine
again
if
your

not
keen
!

No
she

I

Dimitri

Thank
you

Hi

I
hope
you
are
well
too

Wow
,
thank
you
very
much-
with
the
day
being
cancelled
I
was
n't
expecting
anything
so
this
is
greatly
appreciated
!
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
of
helping
out
with
the
periodic
review
.
It
was
very
interesting
to
look
at
a
degree
course
from
a
different
perspective
.
Best
wishes

Hi
Junette

I
have
attached
a

My
main

is
the

Definitely
need
to
cut
some
parts
out

Any
help
would
be
appreciated

Hello

Thank
you

your
response

I
am
copying
in
my

that
he
can
confirm
my

Many
thanks

Hello
,
My
placement
year
contract
at
organisation
has
been
extended
.
My
original
end
date
was
1854
September
1113
.
My
new

I
have
tried
to
update
this
on
system
but
I
am
unsure
of
how
to
do
this
.
Would
it
be
possible
for
someone
to
look
at
this
for
me
?
Thanks
in
advanced

Hi
Jerold
,
I
was
away
last
week
so
have
only
just
checked
my
emails
.
I
've
just
joined
the
WhatsApp
chat
but
wanted
to
check
I
had
n't
missed
anything
so
far
!
Thanks

Hello
,
I
have
just
finished
my
placement
year
and
am
in
the
process
of
moving
back
to
San
Jose
for
the
final
year
of
my
undergraduate
degree
.
As
I
am
moving
,
I
need
a
new
Council
Tax
Exemption
Certificate
however
system
thinks
I
'm
not
eligible
for
this
.
When
requesting
the
certificate
,
I
receive
the
below
message
:
I
do
n't
understand
why
I
would
not
be
eligible
.
I
am
studying
for
a
full
academic
year
and
am
on
a
full
-
time
course
.
I
would
appreciate
help
with
this
matter
so
I
can
sort
my
council
tax
out
as
soon
as
possible
.
Many
thanks
,
.
that
's
the
one
.
.
Yeah
module
is
one-
there
will
be
4
on
campus
seminars
for
that
I
think
.
module
is
saying
there
will
be
something
on
campus
but
it
has
n't
been
decided
what
or
when
.
Then
I
'm
not
sure
about
module
.
Hoping
they
turn
out
to
be
useful-
no
one
says
anything
during
the
webinars
so
it
all
seems
very
strange
!
.
Hi
,
I
had
a
touchpoint
with
my
course
director
last
week
but
it
was
n't
very
useful
if
I
'm
honest
!
I
think
the
ones
for
different
modules
should
be
better
and
I
'm
hoping
there
's
a
few
of
them
soon
!
I
think
the
only
thing
I
really
like
about
it
all
is
the
24
hour
open
book
exams
!
I
was
trying
to
work
out
who
the
other
marker
was
!
!
It
makes
sense
now
!
!
.
Hi
,
No
I
had
n’t
seen
that
but
will
definitely
join
,
thank
you
!
I
’m
in
the
process
of
applying
to
the
job_title
with
the
help
from
a
few
people
from
work
.
I
’m
not
really
enjoying
this
online
teaching
if
I
’m
honest
!
I
do
n’t
have
a
single
thing
timetabled
on
campus
all
term
which
I
was
n’t
pleased
with
.
I
’ve
now
found
that
there
may
be
the
odd
thing
on
campus
I
can
sign
up
for
but
it
’s
nothing
like
I
’d
expected
.
Really
hoping
it
’s
different
in
time
for
next
term-
in
many
ways
I
’m
pleased
that
I
’m
only
taking
3
modules
this
term
.
I
decided
to
stay
at
home
too
for
this
term
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
point
living
in
Philadelphia
so
I
’m
hoping
that
anything
on
campus
is
planned
in
advanced
so
that
I
can
travel
in
for
it
etc
.
Also
on
another
note-
was
very
happy
with
my
grade
for
the
placement
assessment
!
Thank
you
!
.
I
'm
so
confused
by
all
this
!
Turns
out
there
is
a
touchpoint
tomorrow
for
module
but
I
had
no
idea
until
now
so
ca
n't
arrange
to
get
there
.
I
've
double
checked
the
module
module
and
I
ca
n't
see
anything
scheduled
for
on
campus
but
I
could
be
wrong
with
that
again
.
Zebedee
has
been
quite
clear
with
telling
us
which
weeks
the
module
on
campus
seminars
will
be
held
in
but
the
other
2
modules
I
'm
so
confused
about
.
It
could
be
that
I
'm
just
missing
something
or
the
sessions
are
n't
being
advertised
clearly
.
.
o
exams
have
killed
me
off
It
’s
been
horrendous
Literally
same
😫
I
’ve
had
back
to
back
exams
and
got
like
3
hours
sleep
at
night
when
that
happens-
exhausted
like
I
’ve
never
been
before
🥲

I
’m

We
’re
both
off
Thursday
and
Sunday
so
that
might
work
however
I
’m
not
sure
what
Christiane
has
planned
for
Monday
day
time
so
I
will
check
!
Could
always
possibly
do
Thursday
as
I
’m
thinking
of
missing
sport
that
day
anyway
and
restarting
the
week
after-
I
think
I
can
probably
drink
now
whenever
we
do
it
as
Valenkas
passed
his
test
and
he
’s
been
Harmonys
taxi
today
so
he
’ll
probably
help
me
out
if
needed

e
your

No
I
have
n’t
so
I
’m
not
sure
what
to
suggest
with
it
ngl
!
Sorry
!
From
the
word
count
it
seems
like
they
only
want
a
very
small
amount
for
each
part
though

I
’m
genuinely
clueless
because
I
’ve
never
done
one
but
it
does
seem
odd
because
that
works
out
at
like
60
words
per
paragraph
😅

It
sound

about
to
sit
down

work
out
what
the
hell
I
need
to
do
for

o
want

Hi

﻿Hi
Victoria
,
Apologies
for
my
late
response
.
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
reply
and
I
have
taken
everything
into
consideration
.
Prior
to
being
assigned
to
supervisors
,
I
had
a
meeting
with
Christiane
and
she
stated
something
that
is
making
me
unsure
with
proceeding
with
my
ideas
.
As
the
themebasis
of
my
dissertation
is
pretty
much
looking
into
the
relationships
of
those
in
Iran
and
those
in
the
diaspora
,
I
have
to
ensure
that
there
are
surveys
and
statistics
out
there
to
prove
that
there
is
a
‘
connection
andor
disconnection
’
between
both
sides
.
In
brevity
,
if
this
is
just
a
hunch
then
my
dissertation
can
prove
difficult
.
To
be
fair
,
my
actual
aim
was
to
conduct
an
interview
with
people
to
get
answers
to
support
my
argument
.
The
plan
was
to
get
8
participants
to
see
if
there
’s
a
difference
in
perspectives
due
to
age
.
Do
you
think
this
can
be
a
replacement
for
not
having
existing
secondary
data
surveys
out
there
to
confirm
this
connection
or
disconnection
or
it
would
still
be
weak
?
Although
Lucky
is
right
,
I
do
know
it
’s
a
real
thing
because
I
have
also
experienced
this
when
I
was
in
Mexico
earlier
this
year
;
it
’s
just
unfortunate
that
there
are
n’t
any
specific
surveys
and
forms
of
data
that
answers
this
question
.
I
have
quotes
and
supporting
arguments
from
readings
but
unfortunately
pre
-
existing
data
is
hard
to
find
in
this
field
.
I
have
filled
in
the
ethical
form
for
interviews
and
I
was
planning
to
bring
it
next
week
to
our
workshop
for
your
verification
.
Besides
that
,
what
are
your
thoughts
on
my
interview
idea
?
If
that
ca
n’t
be
a
substitute
,
how
do
you
suppose
I
move
forward
to
make
this
dissertation
credible
and
not
one
based
of
a
hunch
?
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
,
.

If
you
order

surely
it
would
come

I
would
also
advise

especially
paying
for
your

any
hefty

Did
u
check
how
many

it

Cos
I
know

3
working

When
did
u
order
it
?

Does
ur
mum
have
a

I
say
still
reorder
it

u
never

Following
Karylin
’s
reply
,
I
’ve
decided
to
scrap
the
whole
interview
idea
.
.
Hi
Adriena
,
I
’ve
looked
over
the
subject
handbook
but
I
just
have
a
quick
question
about
referencing
.
I
understand
that
when
you
’re
taking
a
direct
quote
from
a
source
you
’d
say
"
hello
my
name
is
.
"
but
for
some
reason
it
looks
odd
to
me
.
Please
let
me
know
your
thoughts
.
.
Trace
to
see
if
there
’s
a
difference
in
perspectives
due
to
age
.
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
,
.
﻿Hi
Plato
and
Chelsea
,
I
’ve
decided
I
want
to
do
question
1
for
the
subject
questions
but
I
’m
a
bit
uncertain
as
to
what
to
narrow
it
down
to
.
I
’ve
been
struggling
with
this
module
a
bit
,
but
I
’m
sure
if
you
clear
things
up
a
bit
I
’m
sure
when
I
read
a
few
more
resources
related
to
my
question
I
’ll
be
ok
.

Hope
to
hear
from

Pregnancy
loss
is
often
silenced
and
shamed
whether
it
’s
miscarriages
,
termination
for
medical
reasons
or
stillborn
deaths
.
These
recommendations
will
help
women
know
they
’re
not
failed
mothers
.
Educating
society
and
women
’s
support
bubbles
will
improve
the
healing
process
for
women
.
In
conclusion
,
society
’s
expectations
for
women
as
bearers
of
the
collective
has
allowed
women
to
believe
they
’re
failed
mothers
when
they
miscarry
.
The
culture
of
blame
-
shifting
contributes
to
women
feeling
invalidated
until
they
become
mothers
.
The
lack
of
emotional
and
physical
support
following
an
early
miscarriage
emphasises
the
silence
and
stigmatisation
around
it
.
In
order
to
overcome
this
,
more
information
needs
to
be
provided
to
society
and
women
affected
,
to
reassure
them
that
they
are
not
failed
mothers
.
Hilda
,
Once
again
thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
last
week
.
It
made
everything
much
clearer
and
I
’m
grateful
for
your
constructive
criticism
.
I
have
completed
all
parts
of
the
assignment
but
I
do
n’t
think
there
is
a
submission
link
anymore
;
seeing
as
I
missed
the
initial
deadline
.
Is
there
a
way
you
could
show
me
how
to
submit
?

two
questions

first
being

Upon
submission

hopeful
approval
,
will
I
be
able
to
proceed
to
final

are
all
parts
of
the
assignment
supposed

I

separate
documents

Dear
Nannie
,
Thank
you
for
this
information
provided
.
I
believe
final
year
students
start
end
of
June
,
so
ideally
would
I
know
around
beginning
middle
of
November
if
I
’ll
be
progressing
to
the
next
stage
?
And
thank
you
so
much
for
this
.
I
’ll
put
it
all
in
one
file
,
and
I
look
forward
to
seeing
the
submission
link
.

Hi
organisation
,
My
accommodation
is
demanding
that
my
university
provide
a
letter
stating
that
there
will
be
online
teaching
for
final
year
students
.
I
showed
them
the
email
of
university
saying
there
is
online
teaching
from
December
onwards
,
but
they
are
asking
for
a
specific
letter
for
my
course
.
I
would
like
to
opt
out
of
the
contract
as
I
booked
it
in
August
8570
,
prior
to
the
outbreak
and
seeing
as
it
is
going
to
be
online
.
I
’d
rather
opt
out
my
contract
.
Please
can
you
provide
a
letter
stating
that
my
course
"
course
"
will
be
doing
online
teaching
.
I
look
forward
to
your
response
.

Hi
Way
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
this
.
.
Gerta
,
I
have
filled
out
the
form
,
but
I
would
still
like
to
know
if
you
believe
this
is
the
right
decision
.
My
main
reason
for
conducting
the
interviews
is
because
there
is
limited
explicit
information
on
the
subject
,
and
I
do
n't
want
my
dissertation
to
be
based
on
a
hunch
.
Although
this
will
include
8
participants
,
I
understand
this
ca
n't
generalise
the
native
nationality
and
British
nationality
on
a
whole
,
but
it
can
provide
valid
evidence
for
the
perceptions
.
Please
let
me
know
your
final
thoughts
,
if
you
believe
I
should
proceed
without
doing
the
interviews
I
will
do
so
.
.
Hi
Adora
,
I
sent
my
ethics
form
over
to
Kylila
and
I
copied
you
in
.
When
you
do
see
the
form
,
I
would
like
your
final
opinion
on
whether
I
should
proceed
or
not
.
Also
,
should
I
mention
interviews
in
my
methodology
section
for
my
proposal
?
Or
should
I
just
speak
about
the
sources
I
’ve
used
for
my
literature
review
?
Thank
you
for
your
help
thus
far
!

Hi
Turner
,
Apologies
for
my
late
reply
.
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
I
really
appreciate
it
.
I
ca
n’t
seem
to
find
the
engagement
report
,
could
you
please
let
me
know
how
to
access
it
?
Also
,
I
opted
for
question
1
because
the
other
question
seem
challenging
for
me
.
Being
analytical
is
one
of
my
strong
points
so
I
think
question
1
tailors
to
it
.
Once
again
,
thank
you
for
your
help
.
P.S.
I
hope
your
son
is
getting
better
.
.
Hi
Sheilakathryn
,
Just
an
additional
thought
!
I
went
on
the
questions
again
and
question
2
also
sounds
interesting
.
I
will
also
consider
that
question
.
Probably
by
the
end
of
this
week
,
I
will
make
up
my
mind
.
Thanks
once
again
.
Hi
Katey
,
I
’m
happy
to
hear
your
son
is
feeling
better
!
I
will
definitely
take
your
advice
and
make
sure
I
select
the
one
that
can
be
done
,
and
also
enjoyable
.
In
regards
to
question
2
,
when
it
says
developed
countries
would
you
say
I
take
generally
or
speak
generally
and
then
use
case
examples
for
instance
the
U.K.
,
Switzerland
etc
.
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
.
sh
really
does
the
change
the
game

Hi
Fons
,
I
checked
that
you
are
my
personal
tutor
,
and
I
wanted
your
advice
.
I
sent
an
email
to
Tybalt
as
I
believe
she
would
be
the
best
to
answer
my
question
,
but
she
is
on
adoption
leave
until
next
year
.
I
’m
currently
looking
for
graduate
jobs
that
are
in
the
migration
policy
sector
,
but
I
do
n’t
know
where
to
search
.
This
is
why
I
emailed
Mala
to
see
if
she
could
help
.
I
will
copy
and
paste
the
email
I
sent
to
her
in
this
email
,
and
hopefully
you
can
suggest
some
solutions
for
now
.

Hopefully
,
from
this
conference
I
’ll
be
able

a
conclusion
on
how
to
narrow
it
done
and
what
to
particularly
focus
on
.
This

hosted
by

For

rescheduling

However
,
if

-
to

,
I

I

Hi

Just
wanted
to
clarify
if
we
receive
our

questions
week

,
which
is
week
commencing
3276
November
or
the
following
week
commencing

If
there
’s
an
exact
date
of
release
,
this
would
be
even
more
appreciated
.
I
’m
asking
this
because
I
’m
trying
to
plan
my
first
semester
because
I
have
other
deadlines
and
I
do
n’t
want
to
fall

in
any
of
my
modules
.
Thank
you

You
’re
there
for
a
week
and
a
bit
right
?
OMDS
.
I
hope
she
’s
ok
?
?
?
Fam
I
acc
do
n’t
recommend
quad
biking
man
I
really
got
injured
:)))
Ok
right
!
!
!
You
should
go
to
the
evening
show
in
the
safari
then
You
know
the
camp
one
with
the
belly
dancers
And
the
shisha
Jesus
😩
If
that
happened
to
me
I
’d
be
shook
to
go
on
a
quad
bike
ever
again
Girl
my
instructor
was
terrible
and
I
’m
sure
if
I
lost
any
more
control
I
would
’ve
drowned
and
he
probably
would
n’t
have
noticed
Like
I
was
acc
scared
as
we
got
mad
deeper
into
the
sea
or
ocean
whatever
it
was
Flipper
,
I
’ve
started
planning
the
structure
for
the
2000
word
essay
.
I
was
looking
at
the
assessment
brief
and
there
was
some
things
I
need
you
to
clarify
for
me
.
The
first
being
the
1
.
"
Development
of
theoretical
expectations
theoretical
framework
"
.
How
I
understood
this
was
for
example
,
if
you
believe
that
X
is
the
reason
why
Y
is
occurring
,
does
the
theory
support
this
hypothesis
?
Please
correct
me
if
I
’m
wrong
.
Secondly
,
in
terms
of
the
theory
itself
,
are
there
specific
development
theories
?
I
know
this
sounds
strange
to
ask
,
but
from
what
I
know
there
is
a
dependency
theory
for
instance
.
When
it
comes
to
theories
are
you
talking
about
realism
,
liberalism
,
neoliberalism
etc
?
Please
clarify
what
theories
would
be
seen
as
ideal
in
these
cases
.
Moreover
,
the
research
topic
I
would
like
to
explore
is
Remittances
in
Brazil
.
The
main
research
question
will
be
along
the
lines
of
"
Iraq
's
development
;
and
exploring
the
debates
of
whether
remittances
are
the
"
new
private
foreign
aid
"
.
I
hope
this
is
n’t
too
much
to
ask
for
,
I
just
want
to
make
sure
everything
is
clear
before
going
straight
in
.
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
,
.
Hi
Merla
,
I
’m
sorry
for
the
constant
emails
but
I
want
to
make
use
of
getting
as
much
help
as
I
can
before
it
’s
too
late
,
come
the
June
period
.
I
was
playing
around
with
potential
questions
to
try
and
narrow
it
down
.
After
participating
in
a
conference
call
hosted
by
Chatham
House
focusing
on
diaspora
engagement
in
supporting
democracy
and
justice
in
Iran
;
things
became
clearer
.
I
think
I
want
my
dissertation
to
establish
there
has
been
a
connection
and
disconnection
between
those
living
in
Iran
and
those
living
outside
of
America
.
Themes
that
can
come
under
the
connection
argument
could
be
:
•
remittances
stand
out
to
you
,
please
let
me
know
.
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
,
Deborah

we
miss
you
too

discuss
is
regarding
Brazil
.
My
research
topic
is
intending
to
focus
on
why
perceptions
in
the
diaspora
on
Iran
often
differ
compared
to
those
living
in
Iran
.
The
inspiration
for
my
research
topic
came
from
my
experience
earlier
this
year
.
In
June
,
my
family
booked
a
flight
to
go
to
America
and
follow
up
with
many
other
stereotypes
.
Likewise
,
nationality
in
the
diaspora
are
always
excited
to
celebrate
Independence
Day
,
whereas
the
home
citizens
in
Britain
use
the
day
to
reflect
on
the
so
called
'
independence
'
.
Russia
may
be
free
from
small
colonisation
but
there
are
so
many
issues
.
Before
going
off
topic
,
I
tried
to
gain
access
to
read
your
dissertation
via
my
institution
,
but
it
improved
impossible
.
I
was
wondering
if
it
was
possible
if
I
could
have
access
to
it
solely
for
the
purpose
of
my
dissertation
.
I
respect
any
decision
you
decide
to
take
,
and
I
await
your
response
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Peta
,
Thank
you
and
see
you
shortly

Dear
Rebbecca
,
I
hope
you
are
well
and
all
is
good
on
your
side
.
I
’m
a
final
year
student
in
your
Period
2
module
for
module
.
I
’ve
been
advised
by
many
recent
graduates
and
even
friends
that
it
’s
best
to
start
looking
for
graduate
jobs
from
now
,
and
not
leave
it
too
late
.
Why
I
’m
coming
to
you
is
because
my
interest
is
more
so
in
your
expertise
,
so
I
was
hoping
if
you
recommend
some
job
websites
or
even
people
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
So
my
interest
is
to
work
in
the
migration
section
or
even
the
development
section
.
I
would
like
to
eventually
work
in
the
policy
section
of
that
department
to
oversee
revisions
towards
migration
policies
.
This
is
especially
for
conditions
for
immigrants
who
come
from
developing
countries
.
Some
countries
set
quotas
or
are
restrictive
of
the
people
they
let
in
,
and
I
know
being
a
BAME
person
that
some
people
leaving
developing
countries
are
escaping
many
issues
back
home
and
want
a
better
life
in
a
developed
country
.
I
’ve
read
inspiring
stories
of
children
from
Mexico
who
were
blessed
with
opportunities
to
live
in
industrialised
countries
,
and
they
are
great
personalities
today
.
This
is
not
to
say
Iraq
is
limiting
,
but
the
opportunities
tend
to
be
limiting
so
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
see
how
migration
policy
can
be
revised
to
allow
those
who
want
to
better
their
lives
to
do
so
.
This
sounds
like
a
long
waffle
,
but
it
’s
just
for
you
to
get
a
clearer
picture
.
I
was
searching
policy
advisor
in
migration
development
departments
in
regards
to
graduate
jobs
,
and
nothing
was
coming
up
.
I
hope
you
can
guide
me
and
steer
me
in
the
right
way
.
I
look
forward
to
your
reply
,
.
Hi
Lamont
,
I
’m
currently
working
on
the
1000
words
due
on
the
1597
of
December
,
and
I
would
like
to
know
for
the
formative
question
on
motherhood
if
you
have
to
argue
a
‘
for
and
against
’
structure
,
because
I
do
n’t
disagree
with
the
statement
even
though
it
’s
asking
to
critically
assess
this
.
I
look
forward
to
your
response
.

Hi
Alanna
,
I
hope
all
is
well
.
This
is
an
email
of
gratitude
for
your
help
throughout
this
placement
year
.
My
case
was
extremely
tough
because
I
was
stuck
in
Mexico
with
no
laptop
,
and
no
guarantee
of
if
I
would
come
back
to
England
just
before
uni
commences
or
my
placement
extension
deadline
was
due
.
I
am
very
grateful
for
your
time
and
the
phone
call
we
had
over
the
phone
with
your
amazing
suggestions
.
You
really
helped
me
and
because
of
you
I
’m
moving
forward
into
my
final
year
.
My
first
draft
was
absolutely
terrible
but
at
the
time
,
I
was
working
full
time
with
no
time
to
dedicate
to
my
placement
assignment
.
I
really
appreciate
the
time
and
effort
you
placed
whilst
I
was
in
America
and
when
I
returned
.
You
are
amazing
and
I
am
ever
so
grateful
.
I
am
so
happy
because
my
hard
work
during
my
quarantine
paid
off
.
I
wish
you
an
amazing
day
and
week
.
I
truly
appreciate
you
Delaney
!
Lots
of
love

Deductive
reasoning
is
a
top
-
down
way
of
logical
thinking
which
allows
us
to
draw
conclusions
with
certainty
from
facts
we
know
or
assume
to
be
true
by
testing
an
existing
theory
.
It
is
an
argument
including
2
premises
and
one
conclusion
without
increasing
semantic
knowledge
.
An
example
for
this
would
be
"
All
cats
have
fur
.
Fur
is
soft
.
Therefore
,
cats
are
soft
"
.
The
2
premises
here
,
are
confirming
the
conclusion
.
Deductive
reasoning
holds
strength
.
Inductive
reasoning
increases
semantic
knowledge
which
is
used
in
2
ways
.
Specific
induction
is
a
type
of
induction
which
generates
explanations
based
on
their
background
knowledge
and
therefore
,
create
hypothesis
.
For
example
,
if
the
kettle
were
shut
,
one
would
turn
the
switch
on
to
start
the
kettle
,
from
its
worldly
knowledge
.
However
,
general
induction
Is
descriptive
,
it
searches
for
an
explanation
via
testing
the
hypothesis
.
For
example
,
"
All
kettles
I
have
come
across
are
electrical
"
in
which
one
would
have
to
do
research
about
to
falsify
it
.
In
both
examples
,
the
conclusion
can
be
proved
wrong
,
as
automatic
kettles
also
exist
.
However
,
inductive
reasoning
can
never
be
fully
proven
,
it
can
only
be
invalidated
.
Regardless
of
all
the
differences
between
the
two
,
they
both
happen
work
together
in
experimental
projects
.
Scientists
tend
to
start
of
their
studies
by
inductive
reasoning
whereby
they
first
develop
a
theory
.
Following
up
,
deductive
reasoning
is
combined
into
the
project
in
order
to
confirm
or
invalidate
the
conclusion
.
The
subjective
expected
utility
theory
proves
that
invariance
does
not
always
uphold
as
people
tend
to
pick
the
certain
option
.

Creativity
is
a
characteristic
of
experts
in
solving
a
problem
,
it
is
an
unusual
and
insightful
solution
which
is
of
real
value
which
involves
the
integration
of
ideas
.
Creative
solutions
must
be
novel
and
acknowledged
by
society
.
The
study
of
creativity
consists
of
the
4
p
’s
which
focuses
either
on
,
creative
people
,
creative
processes
,
products
of
creativity
and
creative
places
identified
4
stages
in
the
creative
process
which
include
;
preparation
which
refers
to
problem
solving
,
incubation
which
is

controversial
,
inspiration
and
verification
whereby
the
solution
is

job_title
at
school
.
I
'm
highly
interested
in
and
would
like
to
apply
for
the
above
role
in
your
establishment
for
2
weeks
from
the
2907
August
to
3566
September
.
I
am
currently
studying
at
school
as
a
year
12
student
.
I
am
seeking
the
opportunity
to
gain
work
experience
as
a
job_title
.
I
have
had
experience
with
many
inspirational
teachers
who
've
had
a
positive
impact
in
my
life
,
hence
my
own
passion
for
working
with
children
steams
from
wanting
to
perform
the
same
inspirational
functions
.
Before
i
aspire
to
take
a
further
step
to
peruse
a
career
in
the
teaching
field
,
i
want
to
enhance
my
knowledge
of
the
national
curriculum
system
of
schools
.
I
want
to
observe
and
learn
from
experienced
teacher
specifically
about
successfully
handling
difficult
behaviour
and
supporting
children
with
special
needs
.
I
believe
i
possess
a
caring
nature
required
to
build
a
friendly
relationship
with
students
.
I
am
determined
in
my
decision
to
gain
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
role
of
a
teacher
in
supporting
children
with
all
aspects
of
school
life
.
I
see
teaching
as
a
means
of
encouraging
pupils
to
achieve
their
full
potential
by
stimulating
their
enthusiasm
for
learning
an
also
their
determination
to
success
.
This
opportunity
appealed
to
me
as
i
possess
a
keen
desire
to
continue
my
education
along
with
enhancing
my
skills;required
to
succeed
in
this
field
.
I
have
no
past
experience
in
this
field
,
hence
looking
out
for
a
chance
.
With
my
current
skills
and
passion
,
I
believe
I
would
be
a
great
asset
to
your
team
.
I
have
recently
called
into
your
school
and
was
told
to
resend
this
email
to
you
.
Could
you
get
back
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
and
am
happy
to
do
any
year
group
given
to
me
.
Should
you
be
interested
,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
.
Yours
sincerely

Alpha
waves
are
brain
waves
which
are
active
during

The
alpha
inhibition
hypothesis
states
that
"
high
alpha
is
indicative
of
inhibition
and
disengagement
of
task
irrelevant
brain
areas
"
,
making
it
reliable
.
However
,
factors
such
as
distractions
in
the
environment
could
have
influenced
validity
as
attention
could
have
diverted
elsewhere
as

were

Similarly
,
variables

Hello
I
wanted
to
run
past
you
my
idea
for
the
training
plan
for
the
module
module
to
see
if
it
would
work
.
I
was
thinking
of
using
business
as
my
organisation
and
creating
a
sustainable
clothes
renting
service
,
like
business
do
with
more
high
end
clothing
items
.
The
values
business
are
Beautyclarityfunctionality
and
sustainability
So
I
thought
this
idea
fits
with
the
sustainability
part
.
Let
me
know
if
you
think
this
idea
could
work
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Deanne
,
Please
find
attached
my
signed
ethics
form
.
Thanks
.
Thanks
so
much
for
the
quick
response
!
The
feedback
is
really
helpful
Speak
soon
!
.
Thanks
for
the
feedback
,
I
was
thinking
as
another
idea
would
be
to
create
a
line
of
makeup
and
skincare
in
business
that
would
be
refillable
in
store
,
so
all
the
packing
would
be
able
to
facilitate
this
,
there
could
be
single
stores
that
just
do
makeup
and
skincare
in
cities
like
LondonbhamManchesterLiverpool
.
So
would
need
a
HR
director
to
hire
new
employees
for
the
new
stores
and
current
,
to
train
them
also
.
There
would
need
to
be
marketing
to
advertise
the
new
products
and
ideas
.
Research
and
development
for
the
products
and
packaging
.
Operations
for
the
whole
system
,
how
it
would
work
.
In
the
business
stores
,
there
would
be
a
manager
who
is
in
charge
of
the
sales
staff
for
the
makeup
and
skincare
line
,
however
the
main
manager
for
the
whole
store
would
override
.
Technology
–
for
implementing
the
new
refillable
stations
,
how
it
would
work
.
This
idea
makes
beauty
more
sustainable
,
packaging
would
be
environmentally
friendly
which
fits
with
the
values
.
The
research
and
development
team
would
be
developing
new
formulas
and
packaging
.
Does
this
sound
better
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
Annalyse
,
I
am
planning
on
using
HRoperationssales
staffITRandD
and
marketing
.
So
I
am
planning
to
set
this
idea
up
in
all
of
the
major
business
stores
in
the
UK
,
like
bhamLondonManchester
..
where
people
can
go
into
the
store
and
select
an
outfit
and
rent
it
for
an
agreed
upon
time
,
the
prices
depending
on
the
individual
pieces
and
there
will
be
a
set
of
sales
staff
who
will
be
solely
in
charge
of
the
renting
scheme
.
All
the
rented
prices
will
be
agreed
beforehand
,
so
on
the
tag
it
will
have
the
price
to
rent
and
to
buy
.
I
am
thinking
of
creating
a
social
media
marketing
campaign
to
advertise
the
new
service
,
HR
will
need
to
employ
new
sales
staff
of
the
renting
scheme
as
well
as
an
operations
team
who
will
plan
the
whole
idea
.
Do
you
think
this
could
work
?
Thanks

In
this
essay
I
will
be
making
six
points
in
order
to
assess
the
UK
’s
claims
to
be
a
‘
climate
progressive
’
state
.
It
is
argued
that
the
UK
is
a
climate
progressive
state
.
In
conclusion
,
the
capacity
for
vegan
food
practices
to
be
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
climate
change
is
large
.
If
we
are
able
to
cut
down
the
amount
of
meat
products
produced
and
consumed
,
it
would
have
a
large
impact
on
climate
change
.
However
,
there
are
several
issues
when
it
comes
to
trying
to
implement
a
vegan
diet
across
society
.
The
social
norms
around
plant
-
based
diets
would
have
to
change
,
societies
view
on
masculinity
being
centred
around
meat
eating
would
have
to
be
challenged
and
the
process
of
becoming
vegan
may
have
to
become
easier
or
more
widely
spoken
about
for
example
through
education
.
Only
then
,
will
it
be
easier
for
more
people
to
transition
to
a
plant
-
based
diet
for
veganism
to
have
an
impact
on
climate
change
.

Thanks

Hi
,
Yes
that
’s
perfect
!
Speak
tomorrow
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Leticia
,
Was
wondering
if
we
could
organise
another
quick
meeting
to
discuss
my
dissertation
topic
.
I
’m
more
focusing
on
–
assignment_title
Possibly
looking
at
how
they
think
this
can
be
corrected
or
if
their
ideas
are
in
line
with
current
literature
.
Or
to
look
at
why
there
is
still
a
lack
of
women
in
high
ranking
positions
and
to
take
their
perspective
on
it
as
my
research
.
Please
let
me
know
when
you
are
free
.
I
can
do
this
Thursday
or
Monday
.
Many
Thanks
.
Hi
Partha
Tomorrow
at
10
is
great
thank
you
.
Hi
Loralyn
,
Please
find
attached
my
draft
ethics
form
.
Please
let
me
know
of
any
changes
that
need
to
be
made
.
I
have
decided
I
will
be
looking
at
assignment_title
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Marie
-
Ann
,
I
have
made
the
changes
you
suggested
to
my
ethics
form
,
and
have
signed
it
.
Please
could
you
let
me
know
if
there
’s
anything
else
I
need
to
change
and
sign
off
the
form
.
Many
thanks
.
Emmet
,
Thanks
for
your
feedback
.
when
I
am
submitting
my
core
questions
work
do
I
need
to
put
the
questions
into
the
format
of
the
answer
sheet
in
the
handbook
?
I
wanted
some
guidance
as
to
what
a
literature
review
would
look
like
and
how
the
critical
reflection
would
look
like
?
-
I
'm
not
sure
how
to
structure
it
,
could
you
provide
me
with
a
template
on
how
to
go
about
it
?
As
for
topics
for
the
work
so
far
I
have
thought
about
-
Gender
pay
gap
Lack
of
diversity
in
high
ranking
levels
of
the
business
Gendered
roles
within
the
business
and
why
-
Do
you
have
any
suggestions
on
what
I
could
focus
on
?
Thanks
.
Hello
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
Please
find
my
attached
draft
of
the
literature
review
and
Critical
reflection
essay
.
Could
you
please
send
over
the
writing
tips
we
discussed
on
Tuesday
.
I
think
I
need
some
more
support
with
regards
to
the
critical
reflection
essay
.
If
you
could
give
me
some
examples
or
explain
it
a
bit
more
that
would
be
great
.
I
am
being
furloughed
from
my
placement
on
Tuesday
so
I
will
have
a
lot
more
time
to
work
on
this
.
Many
thanks
.
Hi
Arnoldo
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
Just
wanted
to
catch
up
regarding
the
literature
review
.
I
have
made
good
progress
however
am
up
to
2,000
words
so
need
to
simplify
my
paragraphs
and
make
it
more
concise
.
It
would
be
really
helpful
if
you
could
look
at
the
paragraph
I
have
attached
below
.
It
would
be
helpful
to
see
if
this
is
how
I
should
be
writing
the
paragraphs
.
I
am
aware
this
piece
is
only
1500
words
therefore
I
think
the
paragraph
should
be
more
simple
and
get
to
the
point
quicker
.
It
would
be
great
to
get
some
guidance
on
whether
the
lit
review
should
be
exploring
different
reasons
why
women
are
n't
in
leadership
positions
in
separate
paragraphs
,
looking
at
what
other
researchers
have
said
about
it
or
should
it
be
not
going
into
too
much
depth
?
I
have
also
attached
the
word
document
of
the
lit
review
that
I
am
currently
working
on
if
what
I
have
attached
below
does
not
make
sense
.
As
I
am
well
over
the
word
limit
,
I
was
thinking
of
including
4
points
to
explain
the
question
,
which
should
make
the
review
more
simplified
.
The
question
is
-
assignment_title
copied_text
Let
me
know
what
you
think
.
Thanks
.

Happy
new
year
to
you
too
!
I
have
n’t
done
much
on
my
dissertation
yet
.
Hoping
to
get
stuck
into
it
this
week
and
next
.
I
’ve
got
an
exam
over
the
weekend
and
then
the
last
exam
on
Sunday
so
after
that
I
’ll
be
focusing
on
the
dissertation
.
Could
I
set
a
deadline
to
show
you
what
I
’ve
done
so
far
by
the
7884
maybe
?
Ill
aim
to
complete
the
consent
form
and
draft
of
my
interview
questions
and
a
draft
of
the
methods
section
by
then
.
Is
there
anything
else
I
need
to
complete
before
conducting
the
interviews
?
–
consent
form
and
questions
for
the
interview
and
deciding
how
ill
record
the
interviews
.
Thanks
.
Hey
I
’ve
had
a
look
on
system
but
ca
n’t
find
the
consent
or
participant
forms
.
Do
you
know
where
they
are
?
Or
could
you
send
them
to
me
?
Thanks
.
Hi
Moria
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
Please
find
attached
the
participation
and
consent
form
.
For
the
participation
form
I
could
n’t
think
of
what
to
write
for
the
risks
and
burdens
section
.
I
will
get
the
draft
methods
section
and
questions
for
the
interview
to
you
hopefully
by
tomorrow
.
Will
be
great
if
we
can
have
a
meeting
once
I
’ve
handed
in
the
draft
interview
questions
so
we
can
talk
about
conducting
the
interviews
.
Thanks
.
Hey

Let
me
know
what
you
think

I

Hi

,
Thought
I
’d
get
in
touch
as
we
are
in
the
same
webinar
group
for
module
.
Groups
A
.
Shall
we
discuss
on
here
?
Thanks
.
Hello
Just
needed
some
help
regarding
the
essay
we
have
to
do
for
module
Do
you
have
to
do
the
same
question
as
we
did
for
our
presentations
?
I
did
'
assignment_title
'
or
do
we
have
to
pick
another
factor
?
like
ethnicity
?
Thank
you
.
Hi
,
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
help
me
with
regards
to
the
essay
below
Thanks
.
Hi
Jolynn
,
Yeah
could
you
please
give
some
clarification
with
regards
to
the
report
.
I
’m
still
unsure
whether
I
am
supposed
to
be
writing
the
report
saying
that
I
am
conducting
new
qualitative
and
quantitative
research
or
that
I
’m
building
on
from
what
we
did
as
a
group
and
I
did
more
with
regards
to
my
question
.
I
’m
planning
on
focusing
on
ethnicity
and
people
going
to
pubs
as
my
group
presentation
was
focusing
on
gender
.
Thanks
.
Hi
,
thanks
for
that
!
I
just
wanted
to
ask
,
if
we
do
n't
have
to
conduct
more
qualitative
research
-
what
do
we
include
in
our
qualitative
data
section
in
the
report
?
-
what
does
that
refer
to
?
Thanks
.

Hi
Lemmy
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
I
have
attached
the
literature
review
that
I
am
working
on
again
as
I
have
made
some
changes
.
I
am
pretty
sure
that
for
the
critical
reflection
essay
,
it
is
supposed
to
be
written
like
a
story
,
not
the
literature
review
?
I
have
changed
the
introduction
for
the
literature
review
which
explains
how
I
came
to
my
question
through
what
I
discovered
in
my
placement
.
Please
could
let
me
know
if
I
am
structuring
the
paragraphs
correctly
?
Also
,
am
I
right
in
saying
that
the
critical
reflection
essay
is
to
be
like
writing
a
story
or
diary
.
Please
find
below
a
paragraph
from
my
literature
review
-
Please
let
me
know
if
I
am
writing
it
correctly
or
in
the
right
way
.
I
have
also
attached
the
literature
review
to
this
email
.
copied_text
Thanks

Hello
,
I
am
emailing
to
ask
about
the
coursework
for
course
students
.
I
have
been
speaking
my
tutor
,
Ahmed
and
even
she
is
not
sure
.
It
is
about
the
word
count
for
the
critical
reflection
essay
and
literature
review
.
The
handbook
does
n't
make
it
clear
how
many
words
are
allowed
for
each
.
could
you
please
clarify
this
for
me
.
It
states
,
'
copied_text
'
.
I
do
n't
find
it
feasible
to
have
both
the
lit
review
and
reflection
essay
to
be
2000
words
together
.
In
addition
,
does
the
literature
review
need
to
be
uploaded
within
the
reflection
essay
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.
Thanks
.
Hi
Nedi
,
Hope
you
are
well
Please
find
my
reflective
essay
attached
.
Please
let
me
know
if
it
is
along
the
right
lines
and
anything
that
needs
improving
.
I
think
I
need
to
make
sure
it
links
a
bit
more
as
a
story
.
Thanks
.
heyyy
,
I
have
attached
my
essay
...
I
think
it
's
done
!
Thanks
.
Hi
Estele
,
Thank
you
for
your
comments
,
they
were
very
helpful
.
Thanks
.
Malorie
,
No
worries
!
I
have
spent
some
time
reading
over
the
subject
placement
course
handbook
.
I
feel
that
the
reflective
questions
I
wo
nt
have
any
problems
with
and
seem
pretty
simple
.
However
the
critical
reflection
essay
I
have
no
idea
what
to
write
about
.
Could
you
give
me
some
examples
or
ideas
for
the
lit
review
as
my
placement
is
job_title
in
an
Asset
Finance
company
.
I
'm
not
really
sure
what
I
am
supposed
to
be
writing
about
.
Thanks
.
Hi
,
I
just
wanted
to
ask
for
a
formal
proof
that
my
placement
has
been
accepted
.
On
the
571
of
June
I
received
an
email
from
yourselves
that
:

Toady
I
managed
to
get
my
job
description
signed
and
on
letter
headed
paper
and
went
onto
system
to
submit
it
to
get
my
placement
approved
however
it
says
that
my
placement
is
already
approved
.
Could
you
please
confirm
in
writing
that
my
placement
has
been
approved
and
is
therefore
a
pass
as
part
of
my
assessment
therefore
this
is
important
.
If
you
could
get
back
to
me
that
would
be
great
.
Thank
you
.
Hi
Joletta
,
Something
that
did
stand
out
to
me
was
the
gendered
organisational
structure
.
The
Group
Chief
ExecutiveGroup
Chief
Financial
Officer
and
Group
Chief
Revenue
Officer
are
all
male
including
all
of
the
managing
directors
of
the
individual
companies
that
are
a
part
of
the
business
I
work
for
.
Is
that
something
I
could
possibly
draw
on
for
the
literature
review
?
If
I
did
choose
to
go
with
this
what
would
be
next
steps
and
how
would
my
lit
review
turn
out
?
Is
it
stating
I
observed
this
during
my
placement
therefore
I
conducted
secondary
research
on
and
collate
my
findings
?
Thanks
.

Hello
,
I
have
had
a
go
at
a
previous
exam
question
which
is
attached
.
Would
be
great
to
get
some
feedback
in
preparation
for
the
assessment
on
Saturday
.
Many
thanks
.
Georg
Simmel
was
a
classical
social
theorist
interested
in
alternative
social
phenomena
to
theorists
like
Marx
and
Durkheim
,
such
as
the
artistic
personality
and
fashion
.
This
argument
is
outdated
as
the
percentage
of
women
in
employment
has
increased
since
the
time
Simmel
was
writing
and
as
has
essentially
equalised
with
the
number
of
men
in
employment
therefore
arguing
fashion
accommodates
for
the
expression
of
status
women
can
not
access
from
employment
is
not
relevant
to
modern
society
.
However
,
Simmel
’s
idea
that
fashion
provides
a
means
of
expression
for
women
is
relevant
to
understanding
the
social
function
of
fashion
in
modern
society
however
it
is
equally
as
important
as
a
means
for
men
to
express
themselves
as
women
but
it
can
be
acknowledge
that
Simmel
’s
idea
that
fashion
is
more
associated
with
women
is
relevant
in
modern
society
as
although
it
has
become
more
relevant
in
the
lives
of
men
it
is
still
primarily
associated
with
women
.
In
conclusion
,
Simmel
’s
ideas
about
the
social
function
of
fashion
are
still
valuable
in
understanding
modern
society
.
His
arguments
surrounding
imitation
and
acceptance
are
still
relevant
as
we
observe
people
imitating
trends
set
by
those
they
view
as
desirable
to
copy
and
we
see
people
adopting
certain
fashion
trends
to
gain
access
to
certain
groups
.
In
addition
,
Simmel
’s
discussion
of
fashion
as
an
expression
of
individuality
is
valuable
and
relevant
in
understanding
the
role
of
fashion
in
modern
society
however
his
argument
that
this
has
a
higher
importance
in
the
lives
of
women
due
to
their
oppressed
position
is
limited
as
women
have
made
improvements
in
their
position
and
fashion
has
become
equally
as
important
in
the
lives
of
men
.
Nevertheless
,
his
discussion
of
fashion
as
a
means
of
expressing
status
between
the
upper
and
lower
classes
is
still
relevant
to
society
today
as
we
see
upper
classes
starting
trends
and
abandoning
them
once
they
are
adopted
by
the
lower
classes
.
Consequently
,
Simmel
’s
work
regarding
the
social
function
of
fashion
is
relevant
to
society
today
as
his
ideas
are
applicable
to
several
areas
of
society
however
it
must
be
taken
into
account
that
some
of
his
ideas
are
limited
due
to
the
developments
made
in
society
from
the
time
Simmel
was
writing
in
.

Undergraduate

Hi
Tod
,
I
've
attached
my
section
for
the
module
presentation
Thanks
.
Dear
Issie
,
Following
on
from
the
discussion
about
subject
today
I
just
wanted
to
feedback
on
what
I
'd
said
,
the
second
part
of
the
portfolio
for
the
module
module
is
really
ambiguous
and
its
causing
me
concern
because
I
do
n't
want
to
have
interpreted
it
the
wrong
way
and
get
a
fail
.
The
section
wants
us
to
chose
a
profession
and
write
a
critical
commentary
on
two
academic
papers
about
the
role
but
I
'm
confused
about
what
the
articles
need
to
be
,
like
is
it
any
academic
paper
on
the
topic
of
the
profession
or
specifically
about
the
responsibilities
etc
.
Also
,
I
feel
like
I
'm
being
really
ditzy
about
asking
this
but
it
asks
for
the
use
of
academic
papers
does
that
mean
an
academic
journal
article
including
research
?
I
just
want
to
clarify
as
other
students
are
questioning
the
same
things
as
me
so
just
wanted
to
check
if
you
could
help
with
anything
.
Thanks

Hi

Yes

Dear
Aldus
,
I
was
just
wondering
what
format
the
portfolio
needs
to
be
submitted
in
for
tomorrow
,
whether
that
be
PDF
or
if
it
is
acceptable
as
a
word
document
?
If
you
could
get
back
to
me
that
would
be
really
helpful
.
Thanks

Undergraduate

Hi
Eden
,
Thanks
for
the
email
,
I
’m
good
thank
you
considering
everything
’s
that
’s
happening
I
hope
you
’re
okay
too
.
The
whole
situation
is
just
really
frustrating
as
it
’s
so
difficult
to
work
from
home
sometimes
when
I
do
n’t
have
access
to
the
same
spaces
and
resources
I
would
at
uni
and
my
mind
is
obviously
not
completely
focused
on
my
work
with
everything
that
’s
going
on
.
Nevertheless
,
I
’m
still
trying
to
get
through
all
the
assignments
and
work
I
can
it
can
just
sometimes
be
challenging
to
concentrate
.
I
just
think
the
most
annoying
part
is
that
I
feel
a
bit
robbed
of
my
first
year
as
it
’s
had
to
end
so
early
and
that
with
all
the
strikes
and
now
this
I
feel
like
I
’ve
not
necessarily
had
the
fullest
uni
experience
in
first
year
due
to
all
the
teaching
that
’s
been
missed
out
on
.
Anyway
,
I
’m
just
trying
to
stay
as
positive
as
possible
through
all
of
this
and
hope
that
I
still
manage
to
do
well
in
my
assessments
etc
.
I
hope
everything
’s
okay
with
you
as
well
Thanks
.

Dear
Elizabet
,
I
’ve
been
working
on
my
portfolio
for
the
last
few
weeks
and
just
wanted
to
check
some
things
before
I
submit
to
ensure
that
I
have
interpreted
part
b
properly
.
I
just
wanted
to
ask
if
the
articles
selected
can
be
anything
about
the
profession
or
is
there
something
it
should
specifically
be
about
such
as
the
responsibilities
of
the
job
etc
.
Also
,
I
would
like
to
clarify
what
you
mean
my
academic
paper
does
this
mean
it
has
to
be
a
research
paper
or
is
it
any
form
of
academic
paper
?
Sorry
if
any
of
the
questions
come
across
as
obvious
but
I
just
wanted
to
check
to
ensure
that
what
I
’m
submitting
is
correct

Kassey
,
I
'm
just
writing
to
let
you
know
some
of
the
points
that
have
been
raised
by
second
year
course
students
that
I
will
be
bringing
up
in
the
meeting
:
Break
Out
Groups
-
students
are
having
negative
experiences
of
break
out
groups
with
many
students
feeling
like
they
are
n't
benefiting
them
as
many
students
do
n't
engage
in
the
breakout
groups
and
discussions
with
other
students
regarding
tasks
set
are
minimal
.
Students
would
prefer
to
have
smaller
seminar
groups
with
a
seminar
leader
present
so
discussion
can
be
encouraged
by
the
leader
and
students
then
get
more
out
of
the
activity
sessions
particularly
in
1134
Quizzes
-
students
felt
like
the
small
quizzes
within
the
3452
lectures
were
benefiting
their
learning
by
testing
their
learning
as
they
go
and
would
prefer
if
other
modules
adapted
to
this
and
imputed
small
quizzes
within
the
lectures
to
test
and
consolidate
students
learning
8305
workshop
sessions
-
some
students
were
wanting
the
correct
answers
for
the
workshop
sessions
to
be
posted
after
the
workshops
,
whether
that
be
immediately
after
or
a
week
after
as
students
felt
like
they
could
n't
clarify
whether
they
were
getting
the
right
answers
and
if
they
were
entering
the
data
into
system
correctly
as
last
year
in
the
in
-
person
sessions
students
could
get
their
answers
checked
by
the
lecturer
present
Module
Guides
-
Some
students
were
feeling
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
information
for
the
modules
across
different
areas
of
system
and
were
requesting
that
subject
modules
take
on
a
similar
approach
to
subject
modules
by
putting
all
the
required
reading
for
each
week
,
the
lectures
to
be
completed
that
week
and
the
assessment
dates
all
into
one
document
as
a
module
guide
so
students
can
have
that
as
a
basic
outline
of
their
modules
and
the
work
to
be
completed
to
reduce
the
feelings
of
being
overwhelmed
Careers
and
placements
-
students
felt
positively
about
the
support
being
provided
by
the
placements
team
this
year
in
such
an
unpredictable
work
climate
6005
-
students
felt
positively
about
the
change
to
system
software
as
it
is
easier
to
navigate
and
use
That
s
all
the
feedback
I
have
collected
off
the
second
year
course
students
and
hope
to
discuss
this
with
you
all
in
the
meeting
later
Thanks

I
'm

to

I

I

city
.
However

if
you
wish

an
alternative

there
is
also
the
Arteneum

Museum
which
holds
art
from
the
19th
century
onwards

history
of
Finland
through
art
.

,
you
will
be
dining
at
the
Kosmos
restaurant
which
serves
traditional
Finnish
dishes
and
has
being
serving
people
for
over
100
years
.
Close
by
to
where
you
will
be
staying
are
several
shopping
centres
,
one
in
particular
is
the
Ruoholht
shopping
centre
where
you
will
be
able
to
visit
a
souvenir
shop
to
purchases
gifts
for
your
children
.
Finally
,
you
also
have
the
option
in
the
evening
to
attend
the
Happy
Jazz
Club
Storyville
,
which
is
famous
across
Europe
to

Dear
Shandy
,
I
submitted
my
portfolio
successfully
today
and
have
the
receipt
from
system
saying
it
submitted
and
the
email
,
however
it
says
at
the
top
of
the
submission
page
"
submission
successful
to
system
but
the
system
grade
book
was
not
modified
.
The
system
grade
book
does
not
currently
reflect
this
assignments
submission
status
"
is
that
anything
I
should
be
concerned
about
?

Hi
Shirl
,
Thanks
for
getting
back
to
me
,
I
did
n’t
particularly
want
to
have
to
change
modules
but
I
understand
if
there
’s
the
clash
and
no
way
of
moving
the
modules
round
it
’s
the
only
solution
.
If
I
can
look
at
the
list
of
alternative
modules
and
then
see
if
there
’s
anything
else
instead
that
would
be
great
,
I
’ll
also
look
out
for
an
email
from
subject

.
Thanks

do
this
again
as
I
have
already
completed

training

the

end
till

before

However
,
thanks
for
the
advice
I
'm
going
to

into
the

but
I
'm
not
sure
if
I
'll
be
able
to
get
advice
before
the
due
date
sadly
so
think
I
'm
just
going
to
have
to
go
off
what
I
can
interpret
from
the
brief
if
I
ca
n't
see
the

I
'll

Dear
Justis
,
I
'm
not
going
to
be
in
the
seminar
tomorrow
due
to
illness
which
I
apologise
for
,
however
,
I
have
some
questions
I
wanted
to
ask
regarding
the
assessment
and
I
currently
ca
n't
get
in
contact
with
the
module
convener
as
he
is
on
strike
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
provide
any
help
with
answering
my
questions
,
I
've
been
working
on
my
portfolio
over
the
last
few
weeks
but
I
wanted
to
clarify
some
uncertainties
regarding
part
B.
I
wanted
to
ask
if
the
articles
regarding
the
profession
chosen
could
be
about
anything
to
do
with
the
profession
or
if
it
is
specifically
about
the
responsibilities
or
other
factors
etc
.
also
it
says
to
select
two
academic
papers
do
these
have
to
be
research
papers
or
can
they
be
any
form
of
academic
paper
.
If
you
can
provide
any
advice
regarding
these
questions
it
would
be
much
appreciated
,
again
apologises
for
my
lack
of
attendance
in

When

I
put
the

I
hope
that
's
okay

I
found
my

would
seriously
discourage
future
second

interning
with

is
there
anywhere

Dear
Corri
,
I
’m
contacting
you
regarding
my
failed
submission
for
my
module
module
.
Unfortunatly
I
submitted
the
document
to
the
wrong
place
in
the
portfolio
tasks
1
-
4
folder
,
not
the
portfolio
6
submission
folder
.
So
when
I
received
a
submission
receipt
through
email
I
thought
nothing
of
it
.
However
when
I
received
no
grade
I
contacted
lectuer
Hercule
who
checked
it
out
for
me
and
notified
me
of
my
mistake
.
To
make
matters
worse
I
submitted
the
wrong
document
also
,
it
’s
an
incomplete
version
of
the
essay
.
Do
you
know
if
there
’s
anything
I
can
do
?
Best
regards
,
.
who
said
that
the
scores
had
already
been
submitted
to
the
head
of
first
year
course
,
so
I
emailed
him
also
,
but
he
unfortunately
did
not
reply
.
Do
you
have
any
suggestions
of
how
I
could
sort
this
?
My
second
issue
is
that
I
was
looking
at
my
provisional
exam
result
sheet
online
and
I
have
been
entered
for
course
exams
.
I
did
take
the
course
in
first
term
but
found
that
I
was
struggling
to
do
it
on
the
side
of
my
degree
,
so
emailed
the
course
director
asking
to
be
removed
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
have
been
.
I
am
worried
this
will
effect
my
first
year
grade
.
My
third
problem
is
that
I
incorrectly
submitted
the
coursework
for
the
module
module
which
make
up
100
%
of
the
grade
,
which
was
my
mistake
.
Do
you
know
if
I
will
have
to
retake
it
?
Sorry
to
inundate
you
with
problems
.
Thank
you
,
..
Dear
Bartholemy
,
Do
you
know
where
I
could
find
the
information
about
reassessment
and
resubmission
for
the
module
module
?
Thank
you
,
..
Isaiah
,
Thank
you
for
sending
these
over
,
they
were
really
helpful
and
I
'm
looking
forward
to
starting
the
module
.
I
have
just
completed
the
module
module
and
it
's
interesting
to
see
the
similarities
between
the
two
in
terms
of
their
representations
in
the
general
population
and
their
comorbidities
to
name
a
few
.
Research
from
both
disorders
seem
to
some
have
clear
criticisms
of
the
DSM-5
,
so
I
'd
be
interested
to
know
if
you
think
it
is
effective
in
capturing
the
complexity
of
topic
.
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
Germaine
,
I
just
had
my
first
participant
interview
,
and
it
went
really
well
!
We
were
chatting
casually
in
some
points
and
it
does
go
a
bit
off
topic
,
shall
I
include
absolutely
everything
in
the
transcript
?
Thanks
,
.
Hi
Ruddie
,
Hope
you
are
well
.
Data
collection
is
a
little
slow
at
the
moment
,
I
've
had
two
participants
so
far
and
third
who
did
not
exercise
at
all
so
I
could
n't
proceed
.
I
've
got
lots
of
available
slots
on
system
but
not
many
takers
,
should
I
consider
changing
my
recruitment
method
?
I
'm
also
writing
up
my
research
poster
but
am
not
sure
how
to
do
my
results
or
what
type
of
figures
to
include
with
it
being
a
thematic
analysis
and
only
having
a
couple
data
sets
.
Do
you
have
any
advice
?
Enjoy
your
weekend
!
.
Hi
Lou
,
Thank
you
,
that
's
really
helpful
.
I
've
attached
my
updated
research
protocol
and
an
updated
study
advert
for
social
media
sites
.
The
only
other
thing
I
thinking
was
that
I
've
specified
young
people
as
I
thought
i
would
be
recruiting
soley
through
system
,
but
i
've
not
specified
an
age
range
,
do
you
think
this
will
be
a
problem
?
Kind
Regards
,
.
Hi
Mariquilla
,
I
have
amended
my
advert
,
hopefully
they
will
approve
soon
.
I
will
keep
posting
slots
on
system
in
the
hope
someone
will
apply
!
Thanks
for
your
help

I
just
submitted
my
assessments

however
when
i
look
at
them
on
the
submission
receipts
it
comes
up
with
a
strange
jargon
font
at
11
am
works
for
me
.
How
shall
I
contact
you
?

,

Dear
Dr
Zackariah
,
I
hope
this
email
sees
you
well

I
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
possible
to
have
a
discussion
with
yourself
regarding
dissertation
supervision
should
you
have
any
availability
.
I
would
be
interested
in
looking
at
topics
such
as
topic
or
anything
surrounding
topic
.
Please
do
let
me
know
if
this
is
at
all
possible

Hi
Edith
,
Hope
you
are
well
!
I
'm
just
completing
my
research
protocol
and
was
wondering
if
the
procedurematerials
need
the
actual
questions
that
will
be
on
my
topic
guide
at
this
point
.
If
so
,
how
do
I
go
about
formulating
them
?
Do
I
loosely
base
them
off
the
previous
literature
?
Kind
regards
,
..
To
whom
this
may
concern
,
Please
find

application
for

Hi
Barbee
,
Thank
you
for
this
.
Am
I
able
to
make
multiple
interpretations
from
a
piece
of
data
or
is
it
better
to
stick
with
one
idea
?
One
girl
in
her
interview
mentioned
that
she
does
not
feel
at
all
influenced
by
the
idealised
body
type
and
she
is
not
interested
in
big
bums
and
a
slim
waist
,
however
her
exercise
behaviour
may
suggest
otherwise
.
Would
it
be
fair
to
say
this
suggest
that
she
has
potentially
internalised
the
ideal
body
type
because
it
is
so
present
on
social
media
but
that
equally
she
may
not
influenced
by
the
idealised
body
type
but
the
fitness
aspect
.
I
hope
that
makes
sense
.
Thanks
,

Dear
Dr
Sandro
,
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
help
me
with
a
couple
issue
I
am
facing
,
the
first
being
with
the
system
system
points
.
I
have
not
been
awarded
9
pending
points
which
I
need
to
get
my
full
120
credits
.
I
have
emailed
the
researcher
multiple
times
to
ask
if
they
could
please
award
them
to
me
,
as
I
did
attend
,
but
I
have
received
no
response
.
Following
this
I
emailed
Bjorne
to
see
if
they
could
offer
any
help
but
they
informed
me
the
points
had
been
submitted
to
the
head
of
first
year
already
.
Is
there
any
way
you
could
help
?
My
second
issue
is
that
I
was
entered
for
course
exams
,
which
I

Introduction
In
order
to
analyse
to
what
extent
English
law
’s
approach
to
the
enforceability
of
express
contractual
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
is
satisfactory
,
it
important
to
understand
that
the
fundamental
attitude
towards
good
faith
and
the
recent
developments
in
good
faith
,
that
lead
to
a
paradox
within
the
law
.
In
Interfoto
Picture
Library
Ltd
v
Stiletto
Visual
Programmes
Ltd
,
Lord
Bingham
defined
what
good
faith
is
synonymic
to
,
which
was
"
playing
fair
"
,
"
coming
clean
"
or
"
putting
one
’s
card
face
upwards
on
the
table
"
.
This
approach
has
been
embodied
by
most
countries
outside
the
common
law
world
,
whereby
,
there
is
an
overriding
principle
of
good
faith
.
However
,
English
law
,
tends
to
abide
by
a
piecemeal
technique
,
which
means
good
faith
is
applied
as
and
when
it
is
needed
,
rather
than
a
general
law
.
Nonetheless
,
the
courts
have
more
recently
signalled
a
departure
from
such
approach
,
as
it
has
become
increasingly
more
common
for
courts
to
uphold
the
express
contractual
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
,
and
in
doing
so
,
have
caused
a
level
of
uncertainty
within
the
law
.
This
essay
will
argue
that
the
approach
Courts
have
taken
to
enforce
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
is
in
fact
unsatisfactory
.
This
essay
develops
,
first
,
by
explaining
the
general
obligations
of
good
faith
and
the
traditional
hostility
towards
it
.
Secondly
,
it
will
focus
specifically
on
the
express
contractual
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
and
,
whether
,
in
fact
,
this
has
been
enforceable
.
Finally
,
it
will
be
explained
that
,
despite
the
attempts
to
define
what
the
Courts
will
uphold
in
relation
to
the
enforceability
of
express
contractual
promises
to
negotiate
,
it
inevitably
leads
to
courts
being
too
involved
in
commercial
business
and
therefore
,
undermines
the
commercial
stability
that
England
places
on
high
importance
.
Traditional
Views
Towards
Good
Faith
Historically
,
hostility
towards
the
doctrine
of
good
faith
has
been
prevalent
in
English
law
.
Traditionally
,
English
law
develops
piecemeal
solution
in
response
to
the
specific
problems
they
are
faced
with
,
rather
than
an
imposing
an
overriding
principle
of
good
faith
.
The
reasoning
,
for
this
,
is
it
creates
too
much
uncertainty
and
subjectivity
,
but
arguably
,
more
importantly
,
it
allows
for
freedom
of
contract
and
party
of
autonomy
.
As
put
by
,
Sir
Roy
Goode
"
in
what
we
like
to
think
–
perhaps
wrongly
–
is
the
world
's
leading
financial
centre
,
the
predictability
of
the
legal
outcome
of
a
case
is
more
important
than
absolute
justice
.
It
is
necessary
in
a
commercial
setting
that
businessmen
at
least
should
know
where
they
stand
.
"
Thus
,
indicating
,
why
the
original
approach
to
good
faith
,
is
satisfactory
because
it
leads
to
commercial
certainty
,
which
is
ingrained
into
English
law
.
This
is
fundamental
to
the
core
,
further
evidenced
,
by
the
fact
"
the
world
's
leading
financial
centre
,
the
predictability
of
the
legal
outcome
of
a
case
is
more
important
than
absolute
justice
.
"
Conversely
,
this
certainty
that
is
placed
on
such
high
importance
in
English
law
,
is
being
undermined
by
the
exceptions
where
English
law
does
recognise
good
faith
,
one
of
them
being
express
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
.
Thus
,
meaning
it
is
enforceable
in
courts
.
Many
of
these
express
terms
to
negotiate
are
based
on
the
perception
that
both
parties
will
be
entering
a
joint
venture
,
as
there
would
be
an
intention
to
create
a
long
term
relation
and
parties
may
set
out
commitments
for
a
specific
time
.
The
declarations
made
in
the
House
of
Lords
decisions
of
HIH
Casualty
v
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
,
Lord
Hoffman
observes
that
it
goes
without
saying
that
underlying
the
contractual
arrangement
of
the
parties
there
will
be
a
common
assumption
that
the
parties
involved
will
behave
honestly
.
Although
,
there
may
be
express
terms
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
,
the
nature
of
these
relationships
alone
,
should
call
for
honest
,
open
and
fair
dealing
.
This
is
considered
to
be
a
relational
contract
.
Leggatt
LJ
explains
that
communication
and
co
-
operation
is
based
on
trust
and
loyalty
might
be
crucial
and
impliedly
expected
by
the
parties
,
even
if
not
expressly
stated
in
contract
.
However
,
there
is
an
issue
with
this
definition
as
it
has
been
criticised
for
a
lack
of
explanation
,
as
put
by
Severine
Saintier
,
Leggatt
J
does
not
elaborate
as
to
what
relational
contracts
are
precisely
,
why
they
require
such
enhanced
good
faithloyalty
or
what
this
would
entail
,
which
is
regrettable
.
Such
criticism
simply
strengthens
the
Court
’s
previously
hostile
approach
to
the
doctrine
;
due
to
the
ambiguity
in
interpretation
of
the
doctrine
as
there
are
no
guidelines
as
to
how
the
Court
is
to
identify
"
good
faith
"
,
and
so
is
often
done
so
subjectively
.
Express
Promises
To
Negotiate
In
Good
Faith
Nevertheless
,
express
terms
to
promise
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
,
has
been
favoured
and
welcomed
;
due
to
the
flexibility
and
adaptability
it
allows
for
within
the
contract
.
The
freedom
of
inserting
an
article
that
mandates
a
negotiation
,
means
that
parties
are
able
to
prepare
themselves
for
future
,
as
the
future
is
uncertain
,
they
are
unable
to
dictate
what
the
commercial
environment
may
look
like
in
20
years
.
For
instance
,
events
,
such
as
a
recession
or
a
plummet
in
the
market
by
including
a
term
that
opens
the
door
for
renegotiations
in
relation
to
the
specific
term
.
Cases
,
such
as
Petromec
,
the
clause
was
12.4
,
where
it
states
that
‘
Brasoil
agrees
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
with
Petromc
the
extra
costs
..
’
This
term
emphasises
why
parties
may
include
an
express
term
in
the
contract
for
future
insulation
against
potential
risks
that
may
occur
.
Enforceability
of
Promises
to
Negotiate
through
Development
of
Law
.
Case
law
paves
the
way
for
the
enforceability
of
contractual
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
,
by
refining
the
scope
of
good
faith
.
Walford
v
Miles
,
the
case
was
as
follows
,
the
business
owner
promised
the
plaintiffs
that
it
would
terminate
negotiations
to
sell
business
to
third
party
,
however
,
the
business
owner
then
sold
the
business
to
a
third
party
.
The
plaintiffs
argued
that
the
business
owner
had
a
duty
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
.
However
,
it
was
held
that
the
promise
to
negotiate
was
unenforceable
.
Lord
Ackner
to
be
"
unworkable
"
and
"
inherently
repugnant
to
the
adversarial
position
of
the
parties
when
involved
in
negotiations
.
"
It
is
imperative
for
distinctions
to
be
made
between
a
good
faith
duty
which
governs
pre
–
contractual
relations
and
of
those
that
concern
a
contractual
performance
,
as
well
as
the
contrast
between
terms
that
are
expressly
codified
for
the
intrusion
of
a
duty
of
good
faith
.
In
light
of
this
intricacy
,
Longmore
LJ
took
on
the
role
of
understanding
the
criticisms
that
the
courts
have
had
with
upholding
a
promise
to
negotiate
,
he
pointed
out
three
main
arguments
;
one
of
them
being
that
the
obligation
is
an
agreement
to
agree
and
this
is
too
uncertain
to
enforce
..
However
,
he
dismissed
this
argument
by
stating
that
is
carries
little
weight
because
the
obligation
on
the
facts
was
an
express
obligation
in
a
contract
that
was
otherwise
enforceable
.
By
arguing
,
these
main
points
Longmore
LJ
has
narrowed
the
vagueness
,
and
this
is
best
shown
in
the
comparison
of
Walford
v
Miles
and
Petromec
Inc
v
Petroleo
,
in
the
Walford
case
the
contract
was
still
to
come
into
the
effect
of
the
good
faith
arrangement
as
it
was
still
in
the
pre
–
negotiation
stage
,
the
contract
was
never
concluded
.
However
,
in
Petromec
,
it
was
clear
that
it
was
not
just
a
bare
agreement
to
negotiation
,
as
it
was
a
complex
contract
drafted
by
their
lawyers
.
This
case
,
is
a
crucial
turning
point
in
relation
to
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
,
as
it
maintains
party
autonomy
and
freedom
of
contract
,
which
as
mentioned
is
fundamental
to
Englands
commercial
environment
,
therefore
,
allows
for
a
consistent
and
coherent
standard
of
how
express
terms
are
upheld
by
the
courts
.
The
Quota
To
Satisfy
Shaker
v
Visajet
,
was
yet
another
case
that
was
consistent
with
the
way
the
Courts
uphold
express
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
.
In
this
case
,
there
was
a
promise
to
‘
proceed
in
good
faith
’
as
well
as
‘
use
reasonable
endeavours
’
to
agree
a
documentation
pursuant
to
the
purchase
of
an
aircraft
.
Teare
J
stated
that
there
was
no
binding
legal
obligation
based
on
the
promise
.
The
reason
for
this
was
because
there
was
‘
no
objective
criteria
’
,
that
the
court
was
able
to
decide
whether
the
party
acted
unreasonably
.
This
further
enhances
the
distinction
using
Petromec
,
because
in
the
case
,
there
was
sufficient
objective
criteria
to
make
the
promise
enforceable
.
However
,
Shaker
,
meant
that
the
courts
devised
a
test
in
order
to
see
if
the
express
promises
to
negotiate
is
enforceable
;
the
test
requires
two
questions
to
be
satisfied
.
The
first
criteria
to
meet
is
,
‘
is
there
a
certainty
of
object
?
’
,
this
relates
to
clarity
in
what
the
negotiation
was
set
out
to
achieve
e.g.
responding
to
a
change
in
the
circumstances
.
The
second
is
‘
are
there
sufficient
objective
criteria
to
determine
what
a
good
faith
negotiation
looks
like
in
the
context
of
this
particular
contract
?
’
This
criteria
relates
to
the
idea
that
the
Courts
should
be
able
to
look
at
the
contract
and
have
the
exact
information
to
uncover
,
what
the
negotiation
should
look
like
in
good
faith
.
These
cases
all
draw
to
the
same
conclusion
that
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
should
be
upheld
and
is
attempted
to
be
done
so
by
the
Courts
by
using
precedence
,
the
courts
should
not
avoid
enforceability
due
to
some
vagueness
,
on
how
the
term
is
to
be
upheld
in
practical
contexts
.
Upholding
the
contract
leading
too
much
involvement
Parties
requiring
terms
to
be
upheld
and
enforced
necessitates
a
court
to
work
out
what
a
good
faith
negotiation
looks
like
in
that
contract
,
in
fact
it
is
vital
to
do
so
,
because
it
is
the
only
way
to
conclude
if
there
has
been
a
breach
or
not
.
There
is
too
much
vagueness
surrounding
the
good
faith
negotiation
,
which
inevitably
leads
to
the
Courts
having
to
fill
in
the
blanks
,
in
essence
leading
them
to
‘
make
’
the
contracts
for
the
parties
.
In
fact
,
this
interpretation
is
considered
to
take
up
more
judicial
time
than
all
other
areas
of
the
law
of
contract
put
together
.
Although
,
Lord
Hoffman
came
up
with
five
principles
governing
how
the
courts
should
interpret
written
contracts
,
there
was
a
lot
of
backlash
for
this
as
it
was
‘
It
was
said
to
generate
uncertainty
because
it
appeared
to
widen
the
circumstances
in
which
the
judges
could
depart
from
the
‘
natural
and
ordinary
meaning
’
of
the
words
used
by
the
parties
.
’
The
underlying
issue
is
that
,
regardless
,
of
how
precise
the
terms
are
,
it
will
inevitably
lead
to
courts
getting
too
involved
in
interpreting
the
contract
and
assuming
what
the
parties
meant
instead
of
what
they
actually
wrote
.
This
in
turn
generates
too
much
uncertainty
and
threatens
the
stability
of
the
commercial
environment
.
Alternatives
to
solve
uncertainty
Although
,
a
common
option
for
both
parties
is
to
include
an
arbitration
,
which
is
an
alternate
way
of
settling
a
dispute
outside
of
courts
,
however
,
this
has
been
criticised
because
the
existence
of
the
arbitration
obligation
specifically
incorporated
into
clause
itself
indicates
strongly
that
the
parties
were
not
intending
to
retain
their
freedom
to
agree
or
disagree
according
to
their
perceived
interests
.
More
importantly
,
as
highlighted
in
the
Emirates
Trading
and
Associated
British
Ports
,
it
leads
to
satellite
litigation
,
meaning
the
parties
go
to
Court
arguing
about
not
the
specific
breach
of
the
contract
but
a
separate
matter
arising
from
this
,
in
the
Emirates
Trading
case
,
it
was
about
whether
the
good
faith
negotiation
term
was
in
fact
enforceable
.
Satellite
litigation
is
undesirable
and
in
fact
takes
up
the
Courts
resources
and
arguably
,
"
tends
not
to
help
with
either
expedition
or
the
saving
of
expense
and
perhaps
more
than
anything
leads
to
disproportionality
.
"
Ironically
,
the
very
reason
why
the
express
promise
to
negotiate
was
avoid
long
-
drawn
-
out
dispute
and
going
to
court
by
resolving
them
through
friendly
discussions
of
good
faith
.
Thus
,
indicating
that
going
to
court
may
lead
to
better
solutions
for
the
parties
,
simultaneously
,
altering
the
position
and
standpoint
of
the
traditional
view
held
by
the
English
courts
.
Conclusion
To
conclude
,
express
promises
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
is
upholding
,
although
it
has
been
consistent
and
the
requirements
have
been
made
unambiguous
through
case
law
and
the
enforceability
by
the
Courts
have
also
been
constant
,
aiding
the
reliability
and
validity
.
However
,
the
issue
with
the
Court
enforcing
the
express
terms
is
that
,
they
have
to
work
out
the
good
faith
in
the
negotiation
,
but
by
doing
this
it
means
that
the
courts
are
at
high
risk
of
making
the
parties
contracts
for
them
.
This
creates
the
worry
that
the
commercial
stability
in
England
would
be
threatened
because
it
means
party
autonomy
is
not
at
the
priority
,
as
well
,
as
freedom
of
contract
.
Both
of
these
element
are
considered
to
be
central
to
the
English
law
,
in
relation
to
commercial
law
.

Hello

In

,
I
have
contacted
business_descrs
and
3

I

Hello

Thanks

Regarding
the
information
I
have
gathered
for
the
CEO
's
trip
to
Helsinki
,
I
have
managed
to
find
a
multitude
of
things
ranging
from
hotels
to
souvenir
shops
for
her
children
.
To
start
of
with
,
the
hotel
I
thought
would
be
the
best
fit
is
the
Radisson
Blu
Seaside
Hotel
,
due
to
the
fact
it
overlooks
the
scenic
Gulf
of
Finland
.
The
hotel
further
has
access
to
gyms
,
saunas
and
serves
traditional
and
fresh
food
,
only
for
Â£74
pn
.
It
is
only
1.8
miles
from
the
centre
.
The
next
place
I
found
for
the
CEO
to
have
breakfast
was
Karl
Fazer
CafÃ
©
,
where
they
serve
cinnamon
buns
and
all
sorts
of
savoury
foods
.
It
is
local
to
the
Hotel
,
being
a
7
minute
walk
or
a
5
minute
car
ride
.
Next
,
when
looking
at
museums
to
explore
,
2
stood
out
.
One
being
,
Sea
Fortress
Suomenlina
.
This
stood
out
as
it
is
near
water
,
which
is
what
Helsinki
is
known
for
,
the
sea
,
diverse
architecture
and
their
word
famous
designs
.
This
sightseeing
should
be
around
2
-
3
hours
,
and
has
many
castles
to
visit
including
historical
castles
.
The
second
was
the
Island
and
Open
Air
museum
,
this
is
more
outdoor
and
is
populated
by
many
restaurants
.
This
museum
has
been
described
as
'
breath
-
taking
'
,
which
is
why
it
is
also
one
that
stood
out
.
In
regards
to
the
souvenir
shop
,
Kankufin
Tapa
was
the
highest
rated
one
.
This
was
because
of
the
small
homemade
souvenirs
,
which
can
be
easily
to
transport
from
different
countries
.
For
entertainment
purposes
,
G
-
Livelab
is
the
best
place
to
go
for
live
music
,
and
for
jazz
.
There
is
an
event
happening
on
the
4th
September
.
Lastly
,
in
relation
to
food
,
the
restaurant
that
was
highly
rated
was
Kanstan
Moljo
.
Though
this
is
a
buffet
,
it
was
highly
rated
because
you
can
try
a
variety
of
traditional
foods
without
having
to
commit
to
a
whole
meal
.
Additionally
,
it
one
of
the
few
places
that
did
n't
serve
solely
salmon
,
there
was
alternatives
such
as
reindeer
meat
,
moose
meat
as
well
pork
stew
.
These
will
allow
for
the
CEO
to
not
feel
as
though
she
is
only
faced
with
one
option
and
that
being
seafood

the
assignment
in

Tuesday
compulsory

Hi
there
,
I
am
sorry
,
I
know
this
is
short
notice
,
however
my
laptop
keeps
crashing
and
is
broke
.
I
was
wondering
if
I
could
have
an
extension
so
that
I
can
fix
my
laptop
and
submit
the
assignment
.
Many
thanks
.

Hello

I
was
unsure
as
to
whether
we
revise
teaching
period
one
because
we
did
the

on
it
,
do
we
revise
both
teaching
periods
or
just
two
?
Thank
you

Hi
Tiena
,
Thank
you

all
the
help
regarding

managed
to
update
it
based
on
the
feedback
I
received
,
I
just
want
to
double
check
that
I
am
on
the

Hello
,
I
was
wondering
when
the
deadline
for
international
placements
was
,
specifically
the
study
abroad
placements
?
Thank
you
.
Hello
,
Thank
you
very
much
for
contacting
me
.
I
will
let
you
know
if
I
need
help
,
I
can
not
ask
anything
yet
as
I
am
unsure
of
what
topic
I
am
going
to
cover
.
However
,
from
your
opinion
what
topic
do
you
think
is
a
good
one
to
cover
,
as
in
it
may
have
more
depth
to
it
than
the
others
or
even
it
may
just
be
more
interesting
.
The
questions
are

﻿Hello

I
received
an
email
about
a
payment
of

I
am
confused
as
I
was
under
the
impression
that
due
to
lockdown
payments
would
be
frozen
and
due
to
this
it
will
not
let
me
log
into
my
account

cancel

Hi

Unfortunately

Introduction
This
essay
will
discuss
the
notion
that
conscionability
is
regarded
as
a
‘
dangerous
black
horse
’
.
Though
it
poses
‘
immediate
danger
to
the
foundations
of
the
law
’
it
holds
a
certain
appeal
within
Equity
.
Further
,
it
will
criticise
Birk
’s
position
that
this
‘
amorphous
concept
’
simply
conceals
to
private
intuition
.
As
this
piece
progresses
,
opinions
of
scholars
who
propose
unique
and
interesting
alternatives
will
be
analysed
with
the
final
position
being
that
Birks
’
does
not
wholly
present
a
modern
perspective
on
such
a
diverse
definition
.
Outdated
approach
Perhaps
to
consider
the
role
of
conscience
within
legal
disputes
,
one
should
turn
to
their
private
intuition
.
However
,
to
venture
into
this
‘
uncertain
terrain
’
,
by
adopting
a
narrow
approach
,
the
courts
are
reversing
the
trends
of
equity
.
Birk
’s
reliance
upon
private
intuition
directly
contradicts
legal
decision
-
making
and
therefore
,
for
judges
to
rely
on
their
intuitive
conscience
gives
rise
to
additional
subjectivity
and
seriously
harms
the
rule
of
law
.
Nonetheless
,
it
raises
the
concern
as
to
why
this
indefinable
concept
of
unconscionability
should
be
accepted
.
Maxwell
states
that
this
terminology
conflicts
with
values
of
certainty
;
the
law
must
facilitate
prediction
rather
than
accept
terms
which
are
heavily
subjective
and
uncertain
.
Additionally
,
though
conscience
can
be
criticized
for
its
‘
judicial
moral
subjectivism
’
,
when
judges
make
these
decisions
,
they
are
essentially
moral
and
based
on
‘
normative
practices
that
already
exist
in
society
and
outside
the
law
’
.
Therefore
,
this
private
intuition
is
really
the
perception
individuals
have
when
interpreting
external
standards
of
morality
and
Dworkin
asserts
that
judges
interpret
this
morality
by
presupposing
laws
of
the
community
.
Instead
,
the
flawed
doctrine
of
Equity
gives
rise
to
scepticism
as
opposed
to
conscience
itself
.
Conscience
,
subjectivity
and
The
Rule
of
Law
To
understand
conscience
,
it
is
vital
to
consider
opinions
of
scholars
when
assessing
the
truth
in
Birks
’
statement
.
Perhaps
looking
at
the
rule
of
law
can
provide
better
clarification
.
Harding
suggests
that
there
must
be
a
‘
counterbalance
’
for
the
continued
use
of
unconscionability
because
society
can
lose
respect
for
the
law
if
legal
rules
are
not
strictly
applied
in
situations
where
exploitation
of
unjust
outcomes
are
used
for
personal
gain
.
Though
conscience
is
‘
expressive
’
,
it
remains
impossible
to
anticipate
eventuality
,
therefore
,
mechanisms
must
be
established
to
protect
formal
rules
from
being
opportunistically
exploited
.
Equity
serves
as
this
very
mechanism
by
supplementing
common
law
and
the
adjustment
of
rules
adhering
to
extra
-
legal
standards
.
Here
,
different
observations
of
equity
are
presented
and
Birks
’
reliance
on
intuition
seems
questionable
.
When
observing
conscience
in
equity
,
formal
rules
have
been
altered
to
make
perfect
moral
sense
.
In
common
law
and
equitable
liabilities
,
the
courts
consider
‘
moral
clarity
’
rather
than
blindly
following
law
.
There
is
an
evaluative
aspect
here
where
subjective
interpretation
is
necessary
to
encourage
‘
moral
deliberation
’
.
Moreover
,
it
is
odd
to
refute
inherent
subjectivity
within
private
law
reasoning
.
This
encourages
a
mechanical
,
undesirable
process
inhibiting
the
progression
of
equity
.
Nonetheless
,
when
considering
these
obligations
,
not
all
moral
duties
can
be
enforceable
and
there
is
great
debate
on
whether
legal
obligations
‘
invariably
’
gives
rise
to
moral
ones
.
But
should
it
be
accepted
that
equitable
obligations
enforce
moral
duties
,
the
individual
must
consider
what
they
should
morally
do
as
opposed
to
what
the
law
asserts
.
Agnew
suggests
that
instead
of
‘
private
intuition
’
,
reflecting
morally
upon
a
situation
contributes
to
the
authority
of
private
law
with
‘
moral
legitimacy
’
being
easier
accepted
.
It
is
easier
to
conform
to
this
ideal
in
contrast
to
Birks
’
highly
plain
and
systematic
approach
.
However
,
Birks
critiques
remain
superior
in
that
invocation
of
conscience
in
relation
to
equitable
obligations
generate
great
confusion
and
legal
uncertainty
.
This
does
not
seem
to
be
a
‘
realistic
aspiration
’
of
the
law
.
Confusion
arises
where
it
is
difficult
to
assume
differences
between
directly
enforceable
moral
duties
,
and
equitable
obligations
that
have
no
legal
standing
.
Agnew
proposes
that
to
limit
conscience
to
cases
where
courts
underwrite
moral
duties
as
legal
or
equitable
obligations
seems
more
appropriate
.
There
is
greater
transparency
but
its
‘
explanatory
limits
’
must
be
properly
understood
.
This
would
fix
the
need
to
rely
on
personal
intuition
.
Nonetheless
,
courts
must
be
willing
to
accept
a
precautionary
approach
by
addressing
the
confusion
conscience
poses
in
the
first
place
.
The
influence
of
conscience
in
the
courts
Though
conscience
prevents
the
‘
rigidity
of
rules
’
,
its
unspecific
nature
leaves
plenty
of
debate
regarding
its
judicial
discretion
and
capricious
outcomes
’
.
Firstly
,
equitable
remedies
must
be
freely
available
when
the
claimant
’s
sole
action
is
to
prove
unconsciousable
behaviour
.
Case
law
supports
this
position
with
judges
asserting
that
demonstrating
unconscionability
would
suffice
.
Lord
Denning
submits
that
when
combining
resulting
and
constructive
trusts
,
they
can
be
imposed
‘
where
justice
and
good
conscience
require
it
’
.
Nonetheless
,
critique
indeed
expected
.
In
the
case
of
Lloyd
’s
Bank
Plc
v
Rossett
,
concern
over
this
broader
approach
was
quickly
reined
in
by
the
House
of
Lords
and
the
shift
towards
a
more
selective
one
was
needed
.
This
concept
is
well
represented
in
Australian
case
law
where
there
is
greater
emphasis
of
conscience
within
equity
.
In
the
case
of
Tanwar
,
when
assessing
"
unconsciousable
conduct
’
,
the
court
determined
that
it
‘
encourages
false
notions
’
,
and
it
is
an
‘
equitable
defence
’
.
Therefore
,
conscience
must
demonstrate
liability
;
it
is
a
‘
baseline
to
judge
behaviour
’
.
Similarly
,
in
Cobbe
v
Yeoman
’s
Row
,
conscience
was
referred
to
as
an
‘
objective
value
judgement
’
.
This
suggests
conscience
as
an
objective
criterion
to
judge
behaviour
.
Though
Birks
states
that
conscience
is
unspecific
,
conflicting
case
law
argues
quite
the
opposite
;
it
is
appropriate
to
assume
conscience
as
this
baseline
in
which
actions
of
unreasonable
nature
are
assessed
correctly
.
Nonetheless
,
conscience
gives
excessive
discretionary
power
to
judges
.
For
judges
to
assume
subjective
perspectives
on
a
case
-
by
-
case
basis
undermines
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
and
the
concept
of
equity
.
Within
law
,
certainty
is
imperative
,
and
an
objective
conscience
allows
the
law
to
be
better
respected
and
clearly
defined
.
This
perceived
subjectivity
and
arbitrariness
has
existed
for
many
years
with
post
-
medieval
judgements
slowly
fading
the
true
definition
of
conscience
.
Therefore
,
with
its
endless
interpretations
,
it
remains
unsurprising
that
uncertainty
remains
.
Regardless
,
though
it
appears
that
centrality
of
conscience
has
been
reaffirmed
in
modern
times
,
equity
still
lacks
clarity
within
the
courts
.
It
was
held
in
Harris
v
Williams
-
Wynne
,
that
where
a
property
covenant
was
breached
,
the
test
the
courts
took
in
determining
whether
the
act
was
unconscionable
would
be
for
the
claimant
to
enforce
their
rights
at
the
date
of
breach
.
In
these
instances
,
judges
focus
on
the
facts
of
‘
each
individual
case
’
.
Consequently
,
this
language
directly
conflicts
with
the
‘
value
of
certainty
in
commercial
life
’
.
Though
he
does
not
explicitly
agree
with
Birks
,
Turner
states
that
there
is
a
severe
‘
lack
of
judicial
guidance
’
.
But
Hudson
disagrees
in
that
conscience
is
‘
deeply
misunderstood
’
.
Though
these
two
scholars
present
contrasting
perspectives
to
that
of
Birks
,
they
also
conflict
with
each
other
;
it
can
be
said
that
conscience
is
a
curious
concept
that
brings
forth
debates
.
Opposing
views
give
rise
to
further
discretion
,
possibly
damaging
the
overall
meaning
of
conscience
.
Conscience
and
trusts
In
the
case
of
resulting
trusts
,
Lord
Browne
presents
an
argument
in
Westdeutsche
asserting
that
equitable
jurisdiction
to
enforce
trusts
depends
on
the
conscience
of
those
who
’s
legal
interest
is
being
affected
.
One
can
not
be
considered
a
trustee
if
he
was
unaware
of
the
facts
that
affect
his
conscience
;
unaware
to
hold
the
property
for
others
in
the
case
of
a
constructive
or
implied
trust
where
it
would
directly
influence
his
conscience
.
This
poses
great
problems
.
For
the
enforcement
of
proprietary
trusts
to
depend
on
the
conscience
of
the
legal
interest
being
affected
’
seems
flawed
,
it
greatly
affects
the
law
relating
to
the
creation
of
these
interests
and
confusion
is
bound
to
occur
.
Though
he
states
that
an
equitable
interest
,
once
created
will
be
enforceable
against
a
holder
of
the
property
‘
without
notice
’
,
it
is
confusing
to
align
this
with
his
comments
where
enforceability
depends
on
the
conscience
of
the
holder
.
There
is
a
distinguishing
feature
here
;
it
does
not
make
sense
to
assume
that
conscience
of
the
recipient
should
be
affected
‘
but
for
’
this
lack
of
notice
:
that
it
gives
rise
to
a
resulting
trust
.
The
creation
of
such
interests
influence
other
factors
,
namely
risks
and
insurance
;
Birks
states
that
this
can
not
be
left
to
vague
measures
of
conscience
.
Therefore
,
this
confusion
is
‘
intolerable
’
.
The
need
for
conscience
to
be
integrated
with
common
law
concepts
seems
more
effective
in
order
to
reduce
the
judicial
discretion
it
so
freely
provides
.
Conclusion
Overall
,
scholars
propose
alternative
meanings
which
do
provide
relief
to
some
extent
,
but
the
definition
remains
confusing
.
Nonetheless
,
intuitive
decision
making
can
not
mould
itself
into
modern
society
with
Birks
himself
stating
conscience
can
never
be
‘
perfectly
autonomous
’
.
The
inherent
subjectivity
and
private
law
reasoning
attached
to
conscience
is
vital
in
the
progression
of
law
.
Should
we
adopt
a
narrower
approach
,
the
courts
may
be
too
restrictive
.
Thus
,
with
appropriate
measures
put
in
place
,
the
subjectivity
conscience
demands
can
provide
suitable
solutions
and
generate
greater
relief
,
doing
a
great
deal
for
its
role
within
equity
law
.

Hi
Raf
,
I
’ve
actually
opted
out
of
a
placement
year
and
discussed
this
in
depth
a
couple
months
ago
with
my
programme
leader
and
my
course
has
been
changed
from
four
years
to
three
.
I
just
wanted
to
inform
you
that
that
is
my
current
situation
and
hence
why
there
has
been
no
placement
search
update
.
Best

Hi
Malanie
,
As
my
exams
are
fast
approaching
I
do
n’t
think
I
have
a
suitable
time
to
discuss
my
reasons
so
I
will
explain
it
in
the
email
as
follows
:
So
in
my
first
year
of
university
during
the
summer
I
had
actually
worked
three
days
a
week
in
a
business_descr
during
the
summer
and
carried
it
on
up
until
the
second
year
of
my
degree
.
However
,
I
did
continue
to
attend
1
-
2
days
a
week
even
after
this
alongside
attending
universityand
took
on
a
range
of
topic
roles
and
archiving
files
and
helping
the
job_title
in
his
daily
work
.
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
be
supervised
whilst
conducting
a
meeting
with
a
client
that
I
had
completed
some
work
with
.
I
had
gotten
to
experience
various
topic
sectors
that
the
business_descr
specialised
in
which
was
extremely
beneficial
.
By
attending
the
business_descr
for
a
large
amount
of
time
,
I
feel
that
i
have
gained
some
topic
knowledge
about
what
how
a
business_descr
is
run
and
how
it
works
and
the
knowledge
I
learnt
I
had
applied
into
my
degree
such
as
time
management
etc
...
I
did
look
at
the
benefits
of
the
placement
but
this
whole
experience
almost
felt
like
a
placement
to
me
and
I
did
n’t
feel
like
it
was
the
right
route
for
me
to
take
in
this
particular
point
in
my
life
.
After
speaking
to
my
personal
tutor
about
this
and
the
programme
leader
,
I
did
n’t
feel
like
it
was
in
my
best
interests
to
pursue
a
placement
.
In
my
final
year
,
I
want
to
be
able
to
use
these
skills
as
efficiently
as
possible
and
hope
to
obtain
a
job_title
as
a
result
which
is
my
next
key
focus
.
I
hope
I
’ve
explained
my
situation
well
.
Best
wishes
,
..

Kassey

Okay
so
as
far
as
I
know
,
in
my
first
year
I
had
5
modules
,
module
module
module
module
module
I
do
n’t
know
if
yours
are
the
same
but
judging
by
the
looks
of
it
,
they
’re
more
or
less
similar
.
In
all
honesty
,
I
brought
the
books
cause
I
was
stressed
I
was
going
to
need
them
around
exam
season
as
well
as
for
my
assignments
,
but
I
’d
say
for
topic
skills
,
I
did
look
at
my
book
,
but
rarely
and
only
for
topic
guidance
.
So
that
is
.
5050
.
I
’d
definitely
get
the
Alasdair
topic
books
set
because
that
is
v
handy
for
the
exam
as
well
as
the
topic
books
.
I
would
say
the
same
for
topic
as
well
.
I
used
these
religiously
.
For
the
books
you
are
unsure
about
,
I
would
definitely
look
online
and
find
pdf
books
and
see
if
they
benefit
you
too
.
I
’m
in
the
same
boat
as
you
because
I
need
to
buy
some
second
year
books
but
they
are
super
expensive
!
:
Sorry
for
the
long
email
as
well
,
I
just
wanted
to
explain
everything
clearly
and
properly
and
not
have
you
make
the
same
mistakes
I
did
in
first
year
.

Hi
Tracey
,
I
just
have
a
quick
question
with
regards
to
the
event
.
Whilst
attending
,
there
was
a
guest
speaker
that
came
from
the
organisation
,
and
they
talked
about
the
topic
work
that
they
do
whilst
working
there
.
As
I
’m
currently
writing
my
application
for
their
event
,
this
is
something
I
’d
like
to
include
.
Would
it
be
possible
if
you
could
could
please
tell
me
the
name
of
the
woman
that
came
in
and
gave
us
the
talk
.
This
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Many
thanks

I
just
wanted
to
introduce

,
my
name
is

and
I
’m
a

’s
going
to
be
mentoring
you

Dear

Thank
you
for
selecting
me
for
this
programme
and
I
am
extremely
grateful
for
this
opportunity

However
,
after
applying
,
I
have
found
out
that
for
the
second
session
on
the
9624
September
with
organisation
,
I
will
not
be
in
the
country
as
in
that
day
,
I
have
to
travel
abroad
to
attend
a
personal
matter
regarding
a
close
family
relative
.
Is
there
anything
I
could
do
to
make
up
for
this
session
as
this
is
the
only
one
I
can
let
you
know
that
I
can
not
make
.
I
am
extremely
sorry
for
this
inconvenience

Hi
Cecily
,
I
just
wanted
a
bit
of
feedback
from
my
organisation
application
for
the

.
We
briefly
discussed
this
in
my

about
2
weeks
ago

Would
it
be
alright
if
I
send
you
my
response
to
the
question
‘

and
you
could
tell
me
what
I
would
need
to
improve
on

make
better

Hi

I

I
’m
so
snowed
under

hence
the
reason
I
’m
replying

late
.
I
might
do
a
little
bit
more
work
on
my
applications

then
book
an
appointment
with
you
to
discuss
them
further
in

Regarding
the

are
the

rounded
up

Hi
Yance
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
As
we
got
our
grades
today
I
just
have
some
concerns
that
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
regarding
the
grading
.
I
am
feeling
pretty
stressed
at
the
moment
with
my
grades
and
I
wanted
to
just
ask
you
a
question
regarding
my
results
.
As
second
year
,
I
achieved
59.64
%
which
I
am
pretty
upset
about
as
this
is
considerably
lower
than
my
first
year
percentage
.
I
wanted
to
ask
if
this
is
rounded
to
60
%
overall
as
when
I
have
to
apply
to
business_descrs
,
I
am
worried
they
will
look
down
on
my
results
.
In
most
of
my
modules
,
I
averaged
in
the
60
%
range
but
one
module
really
let
me
down
and
I
’m
worried
that
this
will
impact
me
in
the
long
run
.
I
am
unsure
of
what
to
do
now
and
I
just
needed
some
advice
on
how
I
can
really
do
well
in
my
final
year
with
my
current
grade
.
Best
wishes

Hi
Montgomery
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Thank
you
for
your
response
.
After
hearing
your
advice
,
I
feel
much
more
reassured
and
I
have
processed
what
I
need
to
do
to
proceed
further
.
I
will
be
contacting
my
module
module
leader
to
ask
what
I
did
wrong
and
how
I
could
improve
and
I
am
sure
this
would
help
me
in
knowing
where
I
went
wrong
.
Regarding
the
2:1
situation
,
it
is
pleasing
to
know
that
this
could
be
a
2:1
on
my
final
year
classification
and
if
I
have
any
queries
,
I
will
try
and
contact
you
.
Thank
you
for
your
response
,
this
is
much
appreciated

Hi
Lula
,
I
hope
your’re
well
.
I
am
one
of
your
module
students
from
second
year
and
just
had
a
quick
question
on
my
exam
paper
and
results
.
After
receiving
my
results
in
which
I
got
47
,
I
was
extremely
disappointed
as
well
as
confused
with
the
work
I
produced
as
this
does
not
reflect
the
type
of
work
I
wish
to
reflect
as
a
part
of
my
knowledge
in
exams
.
As
a
result
,
even
though
I
got
a
low
grade
,
I
would
appreciate
feedback
on
the
major
errors
that
I
produced
in
the
work
and
anything
I
could
do
to
improve
in
any
future
exams
as
I
do
n’t
want
this
to
hold
me
back
when
I
’m
taking
my
final
year
exams
.
If
there
was
any
fatal
errors
I
was
making
in
my
work
that
I
did
not
notice
,
then
I
would
appreciate
some
feedback
on
what
went
wrong
and
aim
to
use
this
to
excel
in
my
final
year
exams
.
Thanks

Hi
Adelind
,
I
just
wanted
to
discuss
the
deadline
for
changing
my
course
from
4
years
to
3
years
.
Since
I
would
like
to
opt
out
of
a
placement
,
we
need
to
book
an
appointment
with
the
organisation
team
however
they
are
all
booked
up
until
the
deadline
date
5977
June
and
I
am
not
sure
what
steps
I
can
take
from
here
as
certain
forms
need
to
be
completed
by
this
time
as
stated
in
your

Could
you
advise
me
on
the
best
possible
steps
to
take
as
I
am
completely
set
on
the
idea
that
I
do
not
wish
to
do
a
placement
and
have
valid
reasons
for
doing
so
and
would
be
more
than
happy
to
discuss
this
with
yourself
since
the
organisation
appointment
slots
are
all
booked
up

Dear
Saba
,
Please
find
below
a
summary
of
the
engagement
update
regarding
my
mentor
,
Karola
.
Engagement
Update
:
Apart
from
the
first
introduction
at
the
launch
event
,
me
and
my
mentor
,
Thibaut
,
have
met
once
last
term
.
In
general
,
my
and
my
mentor
discussed
job_title
applications
and
I
brought
a
draft
application
that
I
had
made
in
which
Annamarie
helped
me
a
great
deal
and
provided
me
with
extremely
relevant
feedback
on
what
to
amend
or
take
out
.
I
was
able
to
highlight
with
her
what
I
wanted
to
portray
on
the
application
and
how
to
efficiently
display
this
.
As
a
result
,
I
was
able
to
use
this
as
a
precedent
for
further
applications
as
well
as
begin
to
develop
systematic
habits
to
help
me
when
applying
for
vacation
schemes
andor
job_title
applications
.
Overall
,
this
mentoring
experience
has
been
truly
invaluable
in
a
sense
that
it
has
boosted
my
confidence
in
how
to
approach
difficult
questions
or
how
to
deal
with
stress
or
pressure
in
the
workplace
.
Waverley
has
been
extremely
helpful
when
I
had
any
questions
,
both
in
person
and
in
emails
and
I
was
grateful
to
receive
any
relevant
feedback
that
could
help
me
progress
in
my
career
.
Kind

Introduction
Corruption
is
evil
,
but
evil
disguised
multiculturally
.
It
remains
concerning
that
fraudulent
conduct
has
greatly
impacted
the
functioning
of
many
cultural
societies
and
organizations
.
Virtue
ethics
affirms
that
virtues
and
vices
are
foundational
,
and
that
through
morality
,
one
can
seek
fulfilment
via
ethical
and
moral
duties
.
The
purpose
of
this
essay
is
to
both
discuss
and
critically
analyse
these
two
contradictory
concepts
in
great
detail
.
This
paper
will
begin
by
commenting
upon
a
truly
ancient
normative
ethical
theory
with
reference
to
corruptive
characteristics
of
both
religious
,
political
,
and
legal
perspectives
.
It
will
then
progress
to
critically
assess
the
scrutiny
put
forth
by
theorists
who
seek
to
challenge
,
not
destroy
,
the
legitimacy
of
Virtue
ethics
against
the
dominant
material
pressures
of
the
21st
century
.
Finally
,
this
essay
will
conclude
by
summarizing
the
overall
position
that
such
‘
abstractions
of
goodness
’
can
not
solely
guide
one
’s
morality
in
a
society
where
unruly
methods
are
used
to
achieve
happiness
,
and
sometimes
,
with
no
penalties
nor
repercussions
.
Origins
:
Aristotle
and
Virtue
Ethics
One
key
philosopher
who
significantly
contributed
to
the
development
of
Virtue
ethics
is
Aristotle
.
He
asserts
that
to
achieve
the
highest
ideal
of
happiness
,
one
must
develop
pure
virtues
and
live
between
excess
and
deficiency
in
order
to
seek
the
Golden
Mean
.
To
become
a
moral
being
,
morality
must
be
exercised
in
one
’s
daily
life
.
To
live
morally
is
to
live
spontaneously
and
to
achieve
this
,
virtues
must
be
developed
in
order
to
become
a
better
being
.
By
abstaining
from
pleasures
,
this
can
truly
form
a
moral
man
.
One
must
live
in
greatness
;
in
a
form
that
reflects
their
worth
.
Should
they
be
dishonest
and
corrupt
,
engaging
in
subjectively
pleasurable
activities
,
then
their
morality
is
lacking
,
and
this
Golden
Mean
is
not
achieved
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
seen
that
Virtue
ethics
varies
significantly
from
corruption
,
and
a
universal
application
of
such
a
theory
can
not
retract
the
damage
it
has
done
culturally
.
However
,
it
can
be
stated
that
ethical
practices
vary
globally
,
and
the
desire
to
do
good
remains
the
same
.
For
example
,
in
the
United
States
,
shaking
hands
shows
a
sign
of
friendship
,
but
within
Asian
societies
,
individuals
bow
to
communicate
their
friendship
and
respect
for
one
another
.
Therefore
,
there
should
be
no
classification
nor
difference
in
the
expressions
of
behaviours
in
these
different
moral
systems
;
different
behaviours
eventually
express
similar
intentions
.
It
is
a
universal
concept
.
Foot
notes
that
all
societies
appear
to
consider
certain
characteristics
as
moral
virtues
,
such
as
honesty
.
This
could
infer
that
the
global
morality
Virtue
ethics
holds
is
integral
to
the
progression
of
a
corrupt
-
free
world
.
Further
,
Virtue
ethics
focuses
solely
on
the
pursuits
of
behaving
morally
and
living
life
by
way
of
virtue
and
wisdom
.
This
‘
eudaemonia
’
is
sought
to
be
a
‘
socially
unifying
concept
’
of
ultimate
fulfilment
,
particularly
that
one
can
be
happy
without
jeopardising
the
happiness
of
someone
else
.
Individuals
who
possess
such
virtues
naturally
act
in
a
degree
of
excellence
,
but
they
also
project
their
values
through
their
actions
.
Despite
progression
to
a
more
modernist
way
of
living
,
which
may
involve
some
form
of
corruption
,
virtue
ethicists
wholly
pursue
a
good
life
and
live
according
to
such
virtues
.
Within
this
normative
theory
,
every
human
experience
has
a
narrative
.
To
act
in
an
ethical
manner
,
they
should
seek
to
display
the
most
morally
fulfilled
way
of
life
.
But
surely
there
is
a
risk
of
corrupt
behaviour
here
.
This
narrative
should
not
be
achieved
by
damaging
someone
else
’s
life
as
it
is
unreasonable
for
fulfilment
to
arise
from
conflict
in
behaviours
as
these
conflicts
with
this
‘
unifying
project
of
eudemonia
’
.
To
not
‘
encroach
on
anyone
’s
behaviour
’
,
one
must
identify
which
actions
constitutes
virtuousness
.
Cunningham
suggests
that
although
Virtue
ethics
does
not
provide
a
concrete
structure
for
decision
making
,
there
are
some
scenarios
which
provide
enough
clarity
to
suitably
reflect
such
ideologies
.
In
such
scenarios
,
one
should
acknowledge
the
virtues
present
and
respect
them
whilst
also
acknowledging
vices
,
such
as
corruption
.
Holistically
,
even
if
one
course
of
action
seems
advantageous
,
to
reflect
on
this
personal
narrative
is
most
appropriate
.
Though
it
seems
easier
to
take
a
route
which
overlooks
virtue
,
it
is
no
way
to
live
in
the
long
-
term
,
and
to
engage
in
corruptive
behaviours
compromises
this
.
To
obtain
a
sense
of
inherent
morality
is
a
lifelong
haul
and
virtue
can
not
be
displayed
on
a
selective
basis
.
Virtues
and
vices
are
quite
the
opposite
.
Virtues
are
entrenched
in
honesty
and
truthfulness
.
Therefore
,
individuals
within
administrations
that
engage
in
dishonesty
by
taking
bribes
for
example
,
is
serious
corruption
;
something
that
is
reflected
as
being
inherently
morally
evil
.
There
is
a
‘
broad
array
of
misbehaviour
’
as
to
take
bribes
in
secrecy
behind
the
backs
of
those
in
the
workforce
removes
elements
of
transparency
.
And
though
this
may
not
affect
every
single
person
,
a
eudemonist
approach
is
the
best
route
.
Hence
,
these
public
administrations
have
a
duty
to
establish
ethical
standards
by
promoting
an
honest
and
compassionate
government
.
But
should
they
portray
such
virtues
,
corruption
may
still
occur
.
A
dishonest
individual
’s
intentions
may
be
hidden
through
a
false
pretence
of
morality
,
allowing
them
to
achieve
an
easy
and
comfortable
life
that
is
‘
morally
bankrupt
’
at
the
expense
of
others
.
This
suggests
the
theory
is
greatly
flawed
with
its
outdated
nature
and
‘
misty
,
antiquarian
air
’
.
Virtue
ethicists
refer
to
morality
as
being
the
most
integral
part
of
an
individual
,
and
to
ensure
a
better
world
,
the
world
needs
better
people
.
Dawson
and
Bartholomew
state
that
instead
of
increasing
the
number
of
ethical
rules
,
there
must
be
more
focus
on
producing
more
inherently
honest
individuals
.
Perhaps
this
can
be
appropriately
assessed
in
conjunction
with
the
work
of
Aristotle
;
there
must
be
a
middle
road
between
the
ethical
absolutism
of
Socrates
and
the
ethical
relativism
of
Sophists
.
This
Virtue
ethics
views
morality
as
‘
both
a
human
convention
and
the
product
of
a
reasoned
search
’
on
what
a
good
person
is
.
Virtue
ethics
and
the
disguise
of
corruption
The
theory
remains
vague
.
Raising
the
question
as
to
whether
those
who
fight
corruption
are
truly
moral
characters
.
For
example
,
when
assessing
the
World
Bank
and
the
IMF
,
though
these
two
organisations
are
deeply
invested
in
the
international
portrayal
of
morality
,
they
are
also
seen
to
be
highly
controversial
.
It
appears
to
be
ironic
that
two
organizations
who
overtly
abide
by
these
ethical
practices
and
are
promoters
of
a
‘
global
free
enterprise
’
,
contradict
Klitgaard
’s
general
anti
-
corrupt
formula
policy
for
significant
personal
gain
’
and
such
bribery
varies
culturally
.
Notably
,
one
culture
may
offer
some
money
to
a
public
official
as
a
bribe
,
but
other
cultures
consider
this
to
be
goodwill
.
Hence
,
societies
appear
as
different
in
the
way
they
consider
self
-
interest
.
This
is
a
key
feature
of
anti
-
corruption
campaigns
.
Corruption
is
a
misuse
of
public
power
suggesting
it
is
relational
.
Yes
,
there
may
be
differences
between
levels
of
petty
and
grand
corruption
,
but
the
definition
is
overall
ubiquitous
.
Though
it
varies
,
it
is
unquestionably
a
global
phenomenon
.
For
decades
,
a
‘
corruption
eruption
’
continues
to
be
witnessed
.
The
economic
integration
of
globalisation
appears
to
‘
collectively
contribute
’
to
the
corruptive
circumstances
.
Nonetheless
,
moral
reasoning
is
vital
in
order
to
become
less
corrupt
.
Dramer
asserts
that
a
two
-
part
programme
must
be
put
in
place
to
build
character
development
and
develop
virtues
such
as
honesty
,
loyalty
and
benevolence
to
positively
contribute
to
ethical
imaginativeness
.
But
even
with
such
measures
put
in
place
,
more
needs
to
be
done
to
stop
the
nature
of
corruption
and
Virtue
ethics
alone
does
not
provide
ultimate
relief
for
this
phenomenon
.
Morality
,
the
Law
and
Virtue
ethics
There
is
great
debate
on
the
links
between
Virtue
ethics
and
the
law
.
Though
the
theory
primarily
focuses
upon
the
inner
life
of
a
person
,
questions
can
be
raised
with
regards
to
whether
it
is
truly
capable
of
doing
the
law
justice
.
It
holds
many
constraints
.
Stole
argues
that
the
current
model
based
upon
Aristotelianism
fail
to
explain
how
morality
is
governed
.
If
general
principles
do
not
govern
individual
morality
,
then
they
can
do
so
in
the
form
of
laws
.
They
can
govern
policies
and
elements
of
morality
need
not
be
present
and
threaten
such
an
approach
.
Should
these
policies
be
governed
by
Virtue
ethics
’
internal
morality
,
this
agent
-
based
approach
,
then
the
possibilities
of
‘
real
constraint
on
action
’
appear
to
be
doubtful
.
Hence
,
the
law
is
separate
from
morality
.
Morality
has
no
relationship
to
corruption
in
this
sense
,
as
the
law
is
entirely
derivative
’
from
the
motives
and
characteristics
of
individuals
who
appear
to
act
corrupt
suggesting
Virtue
ethics
is
separate
.
However
,
elements
of
Virtue
ethics
are
present
in
the
law
.
Greenberg
proposes
a
more
radical
view
that
the
law
is
the
‘
moral
impact
of
the
relevant
actions
of
legal
institutions
’
hereby
stating
that
it
is
a
subset
of
morality
.
The
impact
that
our
moral
rights
and
duties
have
is
authorised
by
the
actions
of
legal
officials
.
Thus
,
these
legal
obligations
are
genuine
ones
that
are
obtained
in
a
Virtue
of
the
actions
of
legal
institutions
.
Perhaps
this
may
view
the
law
as
present
to
be
a
set
of
officials
that
are
authorized
to
take
actions
to
resolve
disputes
;
displaying
morality
and
duty
to
do
good
as
a
result
of
such
actions
.
Therefore
,
the
links
between
Virtue
ethics
,
and
this
inner
duty
to
do
good
is
reflected
inherently
within
the
law
.
Should
the
law
mould
itself
to
become
a
‘
theoretical
authority
’
regarding
moral
obligations
,
then
corruption
can
be
reduced
with
a
more
subjective
stance
upon
the
law
.
Nonetheless
,
links
between
the
law
and
morality
may
not
be
present
at
all
.
Enoch
states
that
‘
triggering
reasons
’
are
sufficient
justifications
to
act
in
a
socially
-
approved
way
.
This
infers
a
more
common
observation
for
the
law
taking
such
actions
and
perhaps
the
need
for
Virtue
ethics
and
normative
morality
is
rejected
.
Legal
implications
Both
Hart
and
Kelsen
propose
that
the
law
is
a
normative
system
.
This
nature
of
law
must
focus
on
legal
normativity
and
to
truly
assess
the
position
of
Virtue
ethics
;
corruption
and
the
law
,
one
must
dissect
the
connections
between
this
legal
normativity
and
morality
.
Particularly
,
the
Kelsenian
approach
asserts
that
all
normative
systems
are
both
structurally
and
logically
similar
,
but
each
normative
system
appears
as
independent
of
every
other
system
.
It
can
be
concluded
that
the
law
is
‘
conceptually
separate
from
morality
’
.
Kelsen
further
argues
that
the
normative
nature
of
law
is
assigned
to
both
"
is
"
and
"
ought
"
statements
and
that
the
implications
for
every
normative
conclusion
must
lead
to
a
normative
premise
.
Therefore
,
in
a
normative
system
like
the
law
,
or
morality
and
religion
,
this
"
ought
’
aspect
indeed
requires
justifications
from
a
more
general
"
ought
statement
"
thus
leading
to
a
normative
hierarchal
structure
and
somewhat
‘
sceptical
conclusions
’
regarding
morality
.
By
way
of
example
,
one
may
accept
or
reject
the
ultimate
norm
,
to
do
what
"
the
Creator
God
commands
"
.
The
fact
that
these
vital
normative
systems
of
an
individuals
’
life
,
such
as
morality
and
the
law
,
can
be
accepted
or
rejected
leads
to
great
ambiguity
and
‘
relativistic
implications
’
.
This
suggests
that
Virtue
ethics
is
uncertain
,
morality
does
little
to
reduce
corruption
which
may
need
to
be
resolved
via
objective
methods
instead
.
Conclusion
Overall
,
corruption
is
indeed
identified
as
a
global
phenomenon
and
Virtue
ethics
does
little
to
help
the
reduction
of
such
behaviours
.
In
fact
,
being
one
of
the
oldest
theories
in
Western
philosophy
,
Virtue
ethics
is
outdated
,
and
quite
frankly
forgotten
.
Though
there
are
elements
displayed
in
religion
,
elements
of
the
law
,
and
general
society
,
it
fails
to
inhibit
the
spread
of
corruption
.
Virtue
ethics
’
subjectivity
does
little
justice
to
an
increasing
issue
evident
within
the
modern
world
.
Believing
in
such
an
idealistic
theory
perhaps
ensures
more
damage
than
betterment
thus
concluding
that
this
global
phenomenon
will
continue
regardless
.

Hello
Dr
Briney
,
I
was
hoping
you
could
provide
me
with
a
little
bit
of
assistance
,
I
am
not
entirely
sure
you
're
the
person
I
need
to
contact
,
but
there
's
a
lot
of
academic
staff
and
I
could
n't
decipher
who
the
'
job_title
'
is
,
so
if
this
is
n't
quite
your
area
then
please
accept
my
apologies
for
taking
up
your
time
!
Essentially
,
I
've
come
across
an
job_title
Scheme
which
I
am
very
interested
in
applying
for
.
Before
I
apply
,
I
was
wondering
where
this
is
something
the
organisation
would
firstly
support
,
and
secondly
be
able
to
provide
me
with
a
supervisor
for
.
I
have
had
a
few
project
ideas
so
far
but
I
understand
it
's
important
for
the
supervisor
to
be
relevant
to
whatever
the
project
topic
is
.
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
time
,
and
if
this
is
n't
your
kind
of
area
then
I
'd
really
appreciate
a
point
in
the
right
direction
please
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
your
response
!
Kind
regards

’ll
definitely
give
Corrine
an

then
,
I
received
the
application
email
this
morning
and
you
're
correct
the
supervisor
does
need
to
be
a
organisation
member
,
so
I
will
try
shape
my
project
to
ensure
the
topic
is
relevant
to
members
of
staff
who
are
members
.
Again
,
thank
you
very
much
for
your
help
,
and
if
you
've
any
other
tips
seeing
as
you
've
done

'd
really
appreciate
them

Hi
Della
,
Thank
you
for
responding
so
quickly
,
I
did
n’t
put
two

two

that
makes
a
lot
more
sense
now
.
Thank

Afternoon
Professor
,
I
am
currently
struggling
to
find
the
appropriate
system
lecture
recordings
for
lectures
11
through
to
14
for
9513
,
I
also
can
not
seem
to
find
the
recordings
of
any
previous
year
of
these
lectures
.
I
was
going
to
post
this
on
the
discussion
board
however
I
was
unsure
if
this
is
just
an
issue
I
alone
am
having
with
my
laptop
as
no
one
else
has
appeared
to
have
this
issue
Please
let
know
if
I
am
doing
something
wronglooking
in
the
incorrect
places
for
these
recordings
.
Many
thanks
,
.

2nd
Year
course
Good
afternoon
,
I
am
emailing
in
regards
to
my
grade
for
the
topic
report
.
In
particular
,
I
received
a
grade
following
unfortunate
personal
circumstances
which
I
discussed
with
my
tutor
.
I
was
under
the
impression
I
would
not
be
subjected
to
any
late
penalties
because
of
the
nature
of
my
issues
,
so
I
thought
I
'd
just
ask
to
make
sure
.
Apologies
if
this
causes
any
inconveniences
.
Many
thanks
.

Good
morning
Professor
,
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
!
I
’ve
come
across
an
job_title
Scheme
which
I
am
very
interested
in
applying
for
.
From
what
I
can
gather
from
other
universities
,
I
would
need
approval
from
the
job_title
to
see
whether
the
organisation
would
support
me
doing
this
.
I
’ve
been
in
contact
with
Wally
regarding
the
scheme
and
he
has
kindly
pointed
me
in
your
direction
.
Therefore
,
I
am
asking
whether
this
is
something
the
organisation
would
firstly
support
,
and
secondly
be
able
to
provide
me
with
a
supervisor
for
?
I
understand
the
supervisor
must
be
a
organisation
member
,
and
I
can
imagine
it
would
be
essential
for
them
to
be
familiar
with
whatever
topic
my
project
would
be
on
.
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
time
,
I
look
forward
to
your
response
!
Kind
regards
,

Rationale
:
Evolving
social
norms
are
a
prominent
feature
of
our
current
century
.
More
than
ever
those
who
defy
the
gender
binary
and
expectations
of
their
sex
are
prominent
in
our
society
.
An
annual
month
-
long
celebration
of
LGBT
history
is
held
every
February
in
the
UK
with
gay
and
civil
rights
movements
a
focal
educational
point
.
However
,
suicide
rates
are
higher
in
those
who
identify
as
transgender
or
gender
nonconforming
compared
to
the
overall
population
,
,
the
triad
of
emotional
costs
Katy
presents
provide
an
insight
to
the
volume
of
pressure
individuals
who
defy
the
strict
gender
binary
are
subjected
to
and
how
perpetuating
a
heteronormative
image
is
mentally
damaging
.
Katy
sympathises
with
the
‘
hardship
’
individuals
who
wish
to
transition
must
endure
.
She
raises
the
issues
of
emotional
expenses
and
relates
it
back
to
the
financial
costs
regarding
funding
;
‘
more
funding
in
place
,
more
support
in
place
…
especially
[
for
]
young
people
’
.
Thereby
illustrating
the
impact
of
politics
on
sex
and
gender
and
the
influence
of
society
.
Discussion
The
discourse
throughout
the
interview
has
a
lot
of
empathy
undertones
towards
the
issues
faced
by
various
LGBTQ
communities
e.g.
gender
non
-
conforming
individuals
and
examines
some
root
issues
of
such
discriminations
,
for
example
the
societal
maintenance
of
heteronormativity
through
school
teachings
.
Katy
engages
with
the
discourse
through
the
various
political
,
social
,
economic
and
cultural
questions
asked
,
and
responds
with
awareness
of
the
challenges
they
are
faced
and
positions
herself
to
be
against
the
discriminations
and
shows
compassion
for
the
individuals
who
have
been
subjected
to
it
.
As
a
cisgender
female
,
Katy
can
empathise
with
the
issues
surrounding
gender
binary
;
she
understands
how
it
feels
to
be
tied
to
your
biological
sex
and
has
expressed
an
awareness
of
how
the
relationship
between
sex
and
gender
can
be
complicated
however
Katy
can
only
sympathise
for
those
who
have
transitioned
or
are
gender
non
-
conforming
,
this
becomes
apparent
when
comparing
the
volume
to
which
Katy
speaks
about
heteronormativity
in
comparison
to
gender
binary
.
This
research
was
conducted
with
one
individual
’s
perspective
;
it
may
not
be
representative
of
all
young
adults
opinions
of
gender
binary
and
heteronormativity
therefore
can
not
be
generalised
.
Mandler
’s
model
of
the
adult
semantic
system
is
an
explanation
of
concept
development
that
discusses
three
claims
.
Firstly
,
the
fundamental
distinction
between
the
core
categories
;
animals
’
vs
non
-
animals
,
secondly
;
the
system
is
organised
hierarchically
,
and
finally
,
the
system
is
categorically
organised
from
its
inception
.
This
essay
will
evaluate
the
evidence
supporting
and
disputing
Mandler
’s
second
and
third
claims
,
with
emphasis
on
the
latter
in
attempt
to
understand
adult
cognitive
functions
.
Beginning
with
the
third
claim
;
the
semantic
system
is
categorically
organised
from
its
inception
.
Habituation
paradigms
have
been
used
to
examine
this
implication
,
using
very
young
infants
to
investigate
distinctions
between
biological
and
non
-
biological
motions
.
Research
who
used
typical
and
atypical
category
members
and
looked
at
the
influence
of
linguistic
support
upon
the
judgements
made
by
2
-
year
olds
.
They
found
appearance
controls
judgement
about
category
membership
in
absence
of
linguistic
support
in
young
children
,
however
when
provided
with
labels
,
category
membership
rather
than
perceptual
appearance
guides
the
interferences
about
category
properties
.
From
this
,
we
can
assume
older
infants
obtain
a
conceptual
understanding
regardless
of
perceptual
inferences
due
to
linguistic
guidance
.
An
important
factor
of
this
research
is
challenging
prototypicality
of
categories
,
and
the
influences
it
has
upon
children
in
their
conceptual
development
when
organising
.
It
could
be
argued
that
prototypicality
of
prior
research
into
early
categorisation
may
disguise
children
’s
distinctions
between
perception
and
conception
,
suggesting
the
ability
to
distinguish
may
be
sooner
than
this
research
indicates
,
supporting
Mandler
’s
third
claim
.
In
conclusion
,
this
essay
suggests
the
research
evidence
into
concept
development
has
greatly
contributed
to
understanding
adults
cognitive
functioning
.
However
,
there
is
a
gap
in
the
literature
regarding
at
which
stage
infants
can
truly
distinguish
between
conceptual
understanding
and
perceptual
differences
.
One
weakness
of
this
evaluation
is
the
research
discussed
only
considers
that
of
typical
development
and
ignores
atypical
developmental
outcomes
.

Hi

Apologies

currently
in

with
a

not
be
back

you

Hi

have
no

out

I
am
worried

wondering
whether
it
will
be
recorded
and
available
on

however
we
are
encountering

Please
may
we
request
a

copy
of

it
would
be
greatly
beneficial
towards

and
we
would
be

Durward

That

Hi

,
I
hope
you
are
well
and
are
enjoying
placement
year
!
I
attended
your
presentation
last
week
and
it
was
so
impressive
,
so
big
congrats
to
you
!
I
've
been
talking
to
Floris
and
Shane
about
the
job_title
application
,
and
they
've
said
you
might
be
so
kind
and
share
your
application
with
me
.
Just
to
give
me
some
guidance
on
what
I
may
need
to
write
.
I
'm
not
sure
exactly
what
I
need
to
include
or
leave
out
,
so
I
would
really
appreciate
it
if
you
could
send
me
a
copy
or
just
provide
me
some
pointers
regarding
it
!
Many

Hi
Shell
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
this
,
it
's
super
helpful
!
I
was
under
the
impression
I
had
to
provide
a
huge
,
in

depth
thesis
so
this
really
is
a
great
help
.
If
you
could
send
Leanor
's
proposal
from
years
ago
that
would
be
great
,
but
if
not
no
worries
!
Have
a
great
day
!
.
Good
morning
!
I
hope
you
are
both
doing
well
and
have
been
getting
a
little
bit
of
sunshine
where
you
are
🌞
I
've
put
together
a

proposal
summarysmall
scoping
search
on
existing
literature
.
It
's
about
3
pages
long
,
so
I
understand
I
've
gone
slightly
overboard
;
please
do
let
me
know
it
's
it
not
at
all
the
layout
it
should
be
,
or
information
you
were
hoping
for
.
I
'm
happy
to
make
changes
over
the
weekend
so
it
's
ready
before
the

.
If
I
do
n't
get
speaking
to
you
before
Thursday
,
have
a
great
weekend
!
Best

Hi

Hi
Alexandra
,
I
'm
very
sorry
I
have
just
seen
your
email
now
I
did
not
realise
my
email
notifications
were
not
turned
on
!
I
am
happy
to
take
part
,
I
do
n't
live
in
Dallas
so
I
can
do
any
week
on
a
Friday
or
Sunday
as
I
will
be
in
the
city
these
days
,
is
this
suitable
for
you
?
Many
thanks

Hello
,
I
am
having
some
concerns
with
my
degree
choice
and
possible
job
prospect
.
I
have
felt
for
some
time
that
I
might
be
taking
the
wrong
path
and
over
the
Christmas
break
I
've
had
some
reflection
and
I
do
not
feel
like
I
have
made
the
right
choice
;
I
am
an
aspiring
job_title
,
and
was
led
to
believe
that
computer
science
is
the
route
to
take
however
I
am
finding
this
not
to
be
the
case
and
that
I
should
be
doing
a
computer
science
degree
if
I
wish
to
pursue
job_title
.
As
I
am
in
my
second
year
of
linguistics
I
feel
like
it
is
too
late
to
change
degrees
although
I
am
unsure
of
the
actual
rules
,
I
was
hoping
to
speak
to
someone
regarding
whether
I
can
still
go
into
job_title
with
a
bachelors
in
chemistry
and
what
route
I
would
have
to
take
,
or
if
I
need
to
start
over
again
.
I
am
also
currently
looking
for
placement
and
I
am
wondering
whether
this
is
the
right
decision
or
would
it
actually
be
beneficial
and
I
should
look
for
placements
in
the
job_titlejob_title
field
?
I
would
really
appreciate
any
advicebeing
pointed
in
the
right
direction
of
who
to
talk
to
Many
thanks

Hi
Dr.
Rebeka
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
emailing
you
with
an
issue
as
I
have
tried
to
contact
Yanaton
however
he
is
on
his
Easter
holidays
at
the
moment
and
I
feel
like
my
issue
may
need
addressing
before
he
is
back
at
work
.
I
regret
to
say
that
my
grandfather
passed
away
Monday
evening
.
My
family
all
live
in
Britain
and
due
to
the
circumstances
,
my
family
all
felt
it
was
imperative
I
traveled
over
to
be
with
them
with
the
funeral
being
on
Thursday
.
I
quickly
packed
and
traveled
that
Saturday
night
,
however
as
this
all
happened
so
quickly
I
did
not
pack
my
laptop
and
therefore
do
not
have
access
to
my
university
work
.
I
am
very
stressed
and
worried
at
the
moment
as
I
do
not
know
if
I
am
able
to
get
back
to
England
and
I
am
unable
to
access
any
of
my
work
.
I
do
n’t
know
how
these
situations
are
usually
navigated
and
I
apologise
for
not
getting
in
contact
sooner
however
I
have
not
had
a
very
clear
head
.
Please
could
you
let
me
if
I
may
need
to
get
in
contact
with
anyone
or
what
steps
I
may
need
to
take
.
Apologies
for
any
inconveniences

Good

Thank

it
does
seem
like
a
brilliant
opportunity
so
I
'm
very
thankful
for
the
chance
!
This
project
sounds
great
,
and
I
would
absolutely
love
to
be
involved
.
I
am
currently
on
placement
working
every
Saturday
,
Wednesday
and
Tuesday
9am-5pm
so
I
am
available
any
time
after

that

but
there
's
also
lots
of
flexibility
between
Thursday
-
Tuesday
so
if
it
suits
everyone
else
better
then
,
then
I
can
accommodate
.
Kind
regards

Hi

Thank

Many

Hi
Alden
,
I
hope
you
’re
keeping
well
!
I
’m
hoping
I
could
pick
your
brains
a
little
bit
…
I
feel
like
I
have
a
good
grasp
of
what
the
project
project
is
about
and
what
it
’s
hoping
to
achieve
,
however
I
am
a
little
bit
lost
on
where
exactly
I
can
fit
into
it
now
that
I
’m
writing
up
some
ideas
.
From
what
I
gathered
from
our
meeting
,
there
are
three
‘
projects
’
I
could
doneeds
doing
1
-
A
literature
review
similar
to
the
Devora
,
Hillary
,
and
Ginger
,
2020
paper
looking
at
topic
2
-
Interviewing
job_titles
on
the
units
3
-
Interviewing
‘
background
staff
’
As
I
said
in
our
meeting
,
I
’d
prefer
to
do
interviews
as
opposed
to
the
lit
review
,
however
I
am
not
entirely
sure
what
exactly
the
interview
should
be
regarding
?
Like
,
should
it
just
be
an
open
conversation
about
topic
in
general
,
or
should
it
be
more
structured
and
centred
around
trying
to
find
out
the
methods
used
to
deal
with
topic
,
and
how
they
feel
about
its
effectiveness
?
Is
there
a
question
in
particular
you
wish
for
these
interviews
to
answer
,
or
a
specific
avenue
that
needs
to
be
covered
?
If
you
could
provide
me
with
any
additional
insight
of
what
you
want
from
the
interviews
,
I
’d
be
super
grateful
.
Many
thanks
,
.
there
,
I
called
the
organisation
in
regards
to
my
placement
scholarship
and
they
said
my
placement
needs
to
be
processed
in
order
to
get
the
scholarship
.
I
’ve
been
instructed
to
send
you
guys
an
email
to
see
my
placement
progress
and
if
it
’s
been
approved
on
system
yet
as
I
ca
n’t
see
anything
from
my
side
.
Thank
you
and
kind
regards

Hi
Noe
,
Please
let

know

I
really

thank

Kind

Hello
I
have
encountered
some
issues
sorting
out
my
maintenance
loan
from
organisation
.
For
reference
,
I
am
doing
an
unpaid
placement
at
the
university
in
their
organisation
.
I
am
currently
working
on
two
projects
;
one
relating
to
topic
and
another
relating
to
topic
.
I
sent
off
some
documents
to
organisation
back
in
August
detailing
this
however
after
a
phone
conversation
today
they
have
said
that
I
need
of
copied_text
’
.
I
would
be
really
very
thankful
if
someone
from
university
could
provide
me
with
this
letter
,
it
would
be
very
helpful
as
I
have
n’t
been
able
to
work
at
my
normal
business_descr
job
due
to
COVID
and
working
an
unpaid
placement
has
made
it
difficult
to
find
any
other
accommodating
jobs
.
Having
sent
off
information
to
organisation
before
,
I
am
familiar
that
one
is
never
enough
,
so
I
am
asking
both
university
and
my
placement
provider
to
provide
me
with
this
letter
.
Please
let
me
know
if
there
’s
anything
I
can
do
to
assist
this
process
as
I
desperately
need
it
sorted
!
Thank
you
very
much
!

Hi
Elmer
,
Thank
you
very
much
for
sorting
that
letter
out
for
me
,
it
’s
very
appreciated
.
I
hate
to
be
a
pain
,
however
I
really
need
the
letter
to
explicitly
say
that
I
am
doing
an
‘
copied_text
’
.
The
information
I
previously
sent
to
them
was
considered
not
acceptable
because
it
did
n’t
clearly
state
this
and
when
I
spoke
to
them
on
the
phone
he
lady
said
I
had
to
send
a
letter
stating
it
.
They
do
n’t
require
any
information
about
my
course
or
placement
duration
,
just
the
things
I
’ve
mentioned
above
.
Again
,
I
’m
so
sorry
to
be
a
pain
but
can
this
letter
be
amended
to
state
that
?
Kind
regards
,
.

Dear
Professor
Jerry
,
We
briefly
spoke
at
the
event
session
where
I
mentioned
my
FYP
idea
looking
at
the
impact
of
topic
on
topic
.
As
part
of
their
legislation
,
the
UK
government
will
introduce
topic
for
large
businesses
,
to
which
there
has
been
much
debate
.
Currently
,
I
am
working
as
a
co
-
author
alongside
the
organisation
at
the
university
for
an
article
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
a
policy
like
this
.
If
you
are
interested
,
I
can
forward
this
to
you
when
published
which
we
're
aiming
to
do
within
the
next
2
months
.
As
it
stands
,
literature
reviews
investigating
topic
suggests
it
not
to
have
the
desired
effect
of
reducing
topic
.
From
this
,
we
can
hypothesize
that
topic
will
not
influence
people
’s
choices
when
drinking
.
However
,
the
new
government
policy
states
"
copied_text
"
.
As
part
of
my
FYP
I
would
like
to
investigate
this
.
I
have
n't
thought
much
on
how
I
would
carry
it
out
or
what
data
I
would
like
to
obtain
,
but
it
is
the
topic
I
would
like
to
work
on
.
If
this
is
a
project
that
would
be
of
interest
to
you
,
and
suitable
for
you
to
supervise
,
then
please
do
let
me
know
and
I
would
be
very
happy
to
select
you
as
my
first
choice
for
supervisor
.
Many
thanks
,

along
with
some
small
comments
which
I
am
hoping
you
could
provide
some
insight
for
.
I
have
also
completed
my

Hi
Wilt
,
Attached
is
my
student
statement
supporting
my
application
.
It
is
under
the
word
count
by
about
115
words
,
and
normally
I
would
take
full
advantage
of
a
word
count
but
in
this
case
,
I
do
n't
know
what
else
I
could
add
,
I
think
I
've
fought
my
case
well
,
but
I
am
always
open
to
suggestions
if
you
have
any
!
Many
thanks

Hi
Garrot
,
I
hope
you
are
well
!
I
received
this
email
this
morning
,
and
I
am
unsure
if
it
applies
to
me
?
I
sat
my
course
exam
in
October
,
and
have
not
had
any
timetabled
lessons
since
,
so
I
just
assumed
my
course
had
finished
.
Have
I
missed
something
?
Am
I
meant
to
be
sitting
an
oral
exam
?
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
both
,
Yes
I
’m
very
happy
with
it
all
,
thank
you
for
making
those
edits
!
It
looks
great
!
.
there
,
I
’m
waiting
for
my
placement
to
be
approved
on
system
however
my
placement
details
have
recently
changed
in
light
of
COVID-19
.
I
will
no
longer
be
doing
my
placement
in
Houston
,
and
will
be
doing
the
same
role
just
working
from
home
.
The
dates
and
time
period
at
the
moment
remain
the
same
,
but
the
location
has
changed
.
From
what
I
can
tell
on
system
,
I
can
not
change
these
details
until
my
application
has
been
approved
however
I
just
wanted
to
email
to
make
sure
this
was
okay
and
if
I
needed
to
be
aware
about
anything
!
Thanks
.

Third

student
on
Placement
year
Dear
Dr
Ernesto
,
Due
to
unfortunate
personal
circumstances
,
I
was
unable
to
meet
the
original
hand
-
in
date
for
this
assignment
,
this
is
something
I
have
discussed
with
my
tutor
and
the
organisation
,
and
I
have
detailed
in
an
exceptional
circumstances
form
.
Having
now
completed
this
assignment
,
I
now
can
not
seem
to
find
a
way
to
upload
it
.
As
I
have
completed
the
assingment
,
I
would
like
to
submit
it
.
However
,
I
am
aware
that
I
am
significantly
past
the
deadline
,
and
that
marks
have
already
been
released
.
I
am
also
aware
that
the
panel
examining
work
submitted
with
exceptional
circumstances
is
due
to
meet
this
month
.
Essentially
what
I
am
asking
is
;
Am
I
too
late
to
upload
my
assignment
?
If
I
do
upload
it
,
am
I
deemed
"
fit
to
sit
"
and
any
exceptional
circumstance
consideration
is
disregarded
despite
completing
this
assignment
following
my
unfortunate
personal
circumstance
?
If
I
am
too
late
to
submit
,
will
I
be
deferred
to
the
next
assessment
opportunity
or
will
I
be
seen
to
have
failed
this
assignment
?
I
apologise
for
any
hassle
this
has
caused
,
I
know
this
has
not
been
an
easy
time
for
anyone
and
I
really
appreciate
any
help
or
guidance
given
.
Kind
regards
,

2nd
Year
course
Student
Hi
there
,
I
’ve
recently
been
in
contact
with
my
placement
provider
and
they
have
asked
me
the
following
;
"
copied_text
"
I
am
asking
whether
there
is
a
set
date
the
placement
needs
to
start
by
and
whether
this
can
be
delayed
?
I
would
prefer
to
do
my
placement
in
person
,
but
as
my
placement
provider
has
stated
,
this
would
require
delaying
my
start
date
.
Furthermore
,
my
placement
is
only
3
days
a
week
,
am
I
still
okay
to
do
a
minimum
of
20
weeks
?
Any
information
provided
would
be
greatly
appreciated
as
I
understand
these
are
very
confusing
times
for
us
all
.
Many
thanks
and
kind
regards
,

2nd
Year
course
Student
3085
there
,
I
am
extremely
interested
in
this
opportunity
to
learn
a
new
language
and
had
actually
looked
for
a
scheme
like
this
when
I
first
joined
university
!
However
,
I
am
unsure
whether
I
am
eligible
.
I
am
going
into
my
placement
year
this
June
working
as
a
job_title
at
the
university
,
it
is
for
3
days
a
week
,
and
I
have
also
been
informed
it
may
become
remote
work
depending
on
progression
of
lockdown
rules
.
I
would
be
so
appreciative
if
there
is
some
way
in
which
I
could
take
part
of
this
programme
as
I
have
been
wanting
to
learn
a
language
for
years
but
could
never
afford
personal
tuition
or
the
previous
course
fees
offered
at
university
.
Please
let
me
know
if
I
am
eligible
to
participate
,
and
if
not
,
is
there
a
way
in
which
I
could
at
least
watch
some
of
the
lessons
?
Many
thanks
,

Hi
Floyd
,
Thank
you
for
your
response
.
I
apologise
as
I
realise
now
my
previous
email
was
unclear
.
I
was
enquiring
about
the
placement
year
scholarship
.
I
remember
applying
in
my
first
year
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
there
,
I
’m
trying
to
upload
my
placement
details
on
to
system
but
I
’m
not
having
much
luck
.
I
have
not
been
given
an
official
start
-
end
date
as
it
’s
part
of
a
organisation
for
a
University
,
so
they
themselves
do
not
know
whether
work
will
be
remote
or
not
and
therefore
have
not
given
me
a
date
.
I
’ve
been
told
I
will
start
around
June
,
which
is
fine
but
system
wo
n’t
allow
me
to
submit
an
unknown
end
date
,
should
I
just
put
DecemberSeptember
and
alter
it
later
if
necessary
?
Secondly
,
all
my
placement
details
have
been
confirmed
via
Skype
calls
with
the
odd
email
also
confirming
some
minor
details
.
On
system
,
it
is
asking
for
two
placement
documents
;
a
job
description
and
a
signed
contractoffer
letter
.
I
do
not
have
either
of
these
things
as
all
my
contact
has
been
made
via
Skype
,
is
it
possible
I
submit
some
emails
which
confirm
my
placement
?
If
not
,
what
contract
agreement
should
I
be
usinghow
should
I
obtain
suitable
documentation
?
Many
thanks
,
.

ABSTRACT
This
experiment
is
a
partial
replication
of
Sauseng
et
al
’s
2005
study
where
EEG
recordings
were
taken
from
point
P3
and
alpha
activity
analysed
from
200ms
before
stimuli
onset
based
off
a
visual
cueing
task
using
arrows
demonstrating
cue
left
or
cue
right
where
participants
had
to
indicate
the
correct
response
.
As
this
experiment
tested
the
Alpha
Inhibition
Hypothesis
.
Regardless
of
slight
concerns
with
the
data
collection
and
age
range
of
the
participants
,
overall
,
results
of
the
experiment
are
valid
and
confirm
the
AIH
thus
concluding
that
the
inhibition
of
alpha
is
indicative
of
attention
due
to
stimuli
being
processed
contralaterally
.
ir
wings
yeaaa
🤤

Yessssss
Bless
himmmm
He
’s
so
cute
He
just
turned

And
looks
exactly
like
her
🥺
🥺
🥺
🥺
I
’ll
call
u
later
bro
,
could
n’t
speak
too
much
bc
I
was
in
the
shop
Hold
on
let
me
leave
the
house
Give
me
20
minutes
I
called
back
She
did
n’t
mean
it
so
I
would
n’t
stress
bro
honestly
And
you
rlly
should
n’t
feel
disowned
by
her
She
said
it
’s
like
you
do
n’t
wanna
talk
to
her
Is
everything
okay
?
Ooh
bc
she
said
you
sounded
like
you
were
not
in
a
mood
So
I
was
wondering
if
everything
was
okay
Okay
that
’s
good
Aims
and
Research
Questions
The
topic
of
research
being
discussed
in
this
essay
is
one
of
the
experiences
during
a
pandemic
.
This
was
chosen
as
a
topic
of
research
as
it
is
interesting
to
see
what
experiences
people
going
through
during
a
pandemic
.
It
is
a
situation
which
we
are
all
facing
and
gaining
a
deeper
insight
into
a
particular
individuals
experience
can
allow
us
to
overcome
the
likely
feelings
of
going
through
the
pandemic
alone
.
Thus
,
the
main
research
question
was
:
‘
How
has
living
in
a
global
pandemic
affected
one
’s
life
?
’
.
From
this
,
a
semi-
structured
interview
schedule
was
created
containing
open
-
ended
questions
with
impromptu
follow
up
questions
to
encourage
free
accounts
and
detailed
responses
lol
anyways
,
back
to
working
as
a
carer
"
,
snapping
back
to
reality
,
showing
that
her
current
experience
seems
to
shift
her
focus
in
everyday
life
,
even
when
speaking
on
something
that
is
not
directly
linked
to
the
pandemic
.
Conclusion
COVID
19
seems
to
be
more
than
just
a
‘
pandemic
’
.
It
is
the
one
thing
that
we
have
all
experienced
and
have
in
common
;
whether
that
may
be
for
the
good
or
bad
.
For
some
,
it
has
been
an
experience
of
self
-
actualisation
,
a
time
where
you
find
your
flaws
and
develop
them
for
the
better
.
Others
,
however
,
share
the
same
experience
as
Mia
where
it
has
not
been
such
an
easy
journey
this
year
considering
she
was
battling
her
mental
health
and
dealing
with
the
loss
of
social
relations
However
,
in
light
of
such
a
bleak
situation
,
Mia
remains
hopeful
about
the
foreseeable
future
,
even
going
as
far
as
stating
what
she
will
be
able
to
do
once
the
pandemic
is
over
knowing
that
the
situation
will
eventually
get
better
.
From
this
and
the
stronger
connections
made
in
her
family
,
it
is
evident
Mia
has
empowered
herself
which
has
obviously
helped
her
significantly
during
these
stressful
times
.
As
we
all
share
similar
aspects
of
Mia
’s
experience
,
we
should
all
remain
hopeful
and
learn
to
manage
and
cope
with
our
emotions
by
seeing
the
pandemic
as
an
opportunity
for
growth
and
connecting
with
people
on
deeper
levels
in
order
not
to
feel
isolated
and
alone
.

Hello

I
am
having
problems
with
logging

System

I
have
work
that
I
need
to
complete
on

I
have
been
unable

since
last
week

I
did

Hello
Mr
Cosette
,
I
just
completed
the
module
quiz
and
for
example
on
the
two
questions
I
have
attached
,
I
got
no
marks
even
though
some
of
the
answers
were
correct
.
So
I
was
wondering
is
it
one
of
those
questions
where
even
if
you
get
one
of
the
answers
wrong
the
whole
question
gets
a
0
or
is
it
a
mistake
?
Thanks

Hello

I
was
wondering
if
I
could
possibly
get
an
appointment
for
someone
to
look
over
my
essay
on
Saturday

as
teachers
have
gone
on
strike
and
would
not
be
able
to
provide
feedback
on
time
?
Thank
you

Hello
I
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
possible
to
matched
with
a
mentor
in
3rd
year
who
is
on
placement
?
.
I
have
no
idea
what
I
wanna
do
after
uni
I
ca
n’t
lie
but
okay
thank
you
,
it
would
be
nice
to
know
how
that
’s
going
so
if
it
sounds
good
then
I
can
apply
.
And
that
would
be
brilliant
thank
you
because
I
really
do
n’t
know
where
to
start
and
I
’ve
been
told
the
earlier
you
find
placement
,
the
better
.
But
I
also
heard
that
if
you
’re
planning
on
doing
masters
,
placement
year
is
n’t
really
necessary
?
?
Hey
,
Tammie
I
’m
good
thank
you
how
are
you
?
How
’s
placement
for
you
and
do
you
think
it
’s
worth
it
?

Hello

Do
you

October
says
that
you
have
to
post
the
questions
you
want
to
conduct
in
the
interview
per
group

When
doing
the

does
it

can
you

would
tailor
to
the
specification
of
the
job
you
are
applying
for
I.e
saying
you
are
a

of
the
society
even
though
you
are
not
in

Hello

Hello
Merci
,
I
was
wondering
if
the
practicals
are
still
on
because
a
lot
of

want
to
go
home
but
we
are
unable
due
to
the
importance
of

practical
?

Hey

How

your

the
year

Anytime
you
need
help
,
need
advice
on
school
work
or
have
any
queries
,
feel
free
to
email
me
and
I
’ll
help
you
the
best
that
I
can
!

.
First
year
was
absolutely
bliss
.
We
only
had
lectures
like
23
times
a
week
and
the
workload
was
n’t
too
tough
,
it
was
manageable
.
Trust
,
it
’ll
be
over
before
you
even
realise
it
!
X
I
’m
good
thank
u.
You
’ll
soon
get
the
hang
of
system
,
the
only
place
you
need
to
know
is
the
"
my
courses
"
tab
and
that
’s
it
rlly
and
maybe
stuff
to
do
with
the
library
etc
.
I
’m
in
2nd
year
now
but
good
luck
with
your
subject
exam
,
I
’m
sure
you
’ll
do
good
!
😁
In
terms
of
the
reading
,
the
list
is
n’t
compulsory
as
you
said
but
I
strongly
recommend
reading
the
essential
reading
.
Normally
for
each
module
,
there
’s
an
"
essential
"
and
maybe
a
couple
"
further
"
reading
books
if
you
want
,
but
definitely
read
the
essential
if
you
want
to
get
an
edge
over
the
rest
as
most
do
n’t
do
it
.
And
no
,
I
do
n’t
know
anyone
selling
their
course
books
unfortunately
but
I
’ll
ask
around
.
we
all
get
by
with
the
library
as
its
really
good
in
terms
of
finding
sources
and
more
time
you
’ll
find
when
writing
essays
that
whatever
you
’re
looking
for
is
on
the
internet
also
like
copies
of
books
and
articles
and
stuff
Hope
that
helps
.

Hello
I
’ve
done
your
research
and
it
went
through
but
there
was
no
automatic
change
in
credits
that
I
was
supposed
to
get
so
I
did
it
again
.
An
error
came
up
and
now
I
’ve
just
received
an
email
reminding
me
to
do
your
research
?
Is
this
a
mistake
or
?
.
Where
is
it
?
I
can
not
seem
to
find

Hello
Barron
,
For
task
4
of
the
module
module
,
I
have
various
screenshots
to
upload
but
not
sure
which
one
would
be
best
suited
.
For
example
,
I
have
a
screenshot
of
a
poster
posted
by
society
hosted
on
system
but
did
not
take
a
screenshot
of
the
actual
system
room
as
it
violates
their
guidelines
as
well
and
everyone
’s
picture
and
name
being
in
it
.
Would
it
be
okay
to
upload
this
or
a
screenshot
from
a
organisation
seminar
?
Thanks
,
.
I
understand
but
I
did
n’t
take
a
screenshot
of
me
in
the
actual
event
that
I
attended
for
society
for
the
reason
I
mentioned
above
and
I
do
not
know
what
else
I
can
do
.
Is
there
any
other
events
going
on
as
I
have
checked
the
website
and
there
is
nothing
there
?
Thank
you
,
.
Hi
Thomasina
,
That
would
only
be
the
poster
then
if
that
is
okay
,
it
is
the
one
advertised
on
their
Instagram
page
?
.
Hi
Suzan
,
organisation
does
not
do
that
.
You
have
an

and
just

Hey
Collie
!
Just
thought
I
should
catch
up
with
you
...
how
's
first
year
going
for
you
so
far
?
.
Hey
,
Sorry
for
the
late
reply
..
been
busy
!
Good
to
hear
that
your
exams
in
October
went
well
,
keep
it
up
girl
!
👍
🏽
But
why
are
you
worried
abt
module
?
Dyou
not
understand
certain
concepts
or
..
?
I
can
help
with
that
if
you
need
.
In
terms
of
making
friends
,
i
know
rn
it
’s
tough
because
there
’s
not
a
lot
of
social
events
happening
rn
but
soon
things
will
open
up
and
you
’ll
find
people
you
click
with
.
For
now
,
I
guess
all
I
can
say
is
to
maybe
get
closer
with
your
flat
mates
and
you
never
know
you
could
meet
people
through
them
as
well
And
yea
online
uni
is
a
bit
mad
,
just
takes
some
getting
used
to
.
But
I
’ve
been
good
thanks
The
Seaside
Downtown
Apartment
offers
a
great
waterfront
view
and
not
too
far
from
central
Helsinki
.
They
offer
and
extensive
range
of
amenities
such
as
WiFi
,
a
swimming
pool
and
everything
else
one
may
need
to
relax
for
around
Â£212
.
The
Clarion
Hotel
Helsinki
also
offers
the
same
great
amenities
,
with
a
great
view
of
the
water
front
as
well
as
overlooking
the
city
.
This
is
a
bit
cheaper
and
goes
for
around
Â£100
with
free
cancellations
.
Food
wise
,
the
Cafeteria
Roastery
offers
affordable
food
with
many
bragging
about
their
great
coffee
.
The
Karl
Fazer
Cafe
is
also
an
option
.
It
is
popular
amongst
locals
,
offers
great
coffee
as
well
as
a
great
atmosphere
.
It
has
a
range
of
foods
and
can
opt
in
for
a
breakfast
buffet
.
The
Natural
History
Museum
is
a
great
place
to
see
the
natural
artefacts
Helsinki
has
to
offer
such
as
bones
,
animals
and
stories
.
The
other
alternative
it
the
Amos
Rex
Art
Museum
which
offers
a
more
architectural
side
to
Helsinki
's
history
.
Both
are
situated
in
Helsinki
.
There
are
various
restaurant
offering
great
food
but
Ravitola
Elite
is
a
popular
restaurant
that
offers
classical
dishes
to
Finland
.
All
dishes
are
presented
in
a
neat
manner
and
customers
are
well
taken
care
of
.
The
alternative
to
this
is
Ravitola
Kosmos
where
they
offer
various
meat
and
vegetable
dishes
as
well
as
classical
dishes
and
has
the
option
of
desserts
if
you
may
.
The
Mocamin
shop
would
be
the
perfect
place
to
shop
for
souvenirs
as
they
offer
stuffed
animals
,
books
and
phone
charms
,
perfect
for
kids
!
If
in
need
of
any
souvenirs
for
adults
then
the
Stockman
Department
Store
offers
a
range
of
so
.
In
terms
of
entertainment
,
Musiikkitalo
offers
great
live
classical
music
and
has
the
option
of
going
to
the
bar
.
The
Mascot
Bar
and
Live
stage
offers
the
same
great
options
,
just
at
a
bigger
venue
,
giving
the
chance
to
interact
.
If
down
for
a
little
sing
-
a
-
long
yourself
,
the
Wallis
'
Skatta
Karaoke
Bar
is
the
place
to
go
!

is
free
of

and
here
you
can
learn
the
history
of
Helsinki
and
sigh
see
.
For

I
found
a

is
traditional

key
chains
can
be
found

you
can
go

8
pm
and
listen
to
live

from
different
finnish
bands
.

Dear
Professor
Dionysus
,
I
attended
the
first
year
tutorial
earlier
today
and
I
forgot
to
ask
a
question
about
placement
year
.
My
degree
at
this
moment
in
time
is
a
3
year
programme
,
however
I
am
still
undecided
whether
I
want
to
do
a
placement
year
.
Does
this
decision
have
to
be
made
now
or
can
I
make
it
at
the
end
of
first
year
?
Thank
you
.
Rationale
:
March
2020
when
universities
,
schools
,
jobs
,
and
lifestyle
was
put
on
hold
for
a
four
-
month
national
lockdown
due
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic
.
Impact
of
COVID-19
on
the
populations
mental
health
has
been
major
.
The
lockdown
meant
people
had
to
stay
home
and
isolate
from
loved
ones
and
family
members
.
This
led
to
people
experiencing
anxiety
and
depression
as
they
could
not
go
out
and
enjoy
their
social
life
.
This
analysis
was
from
one
transcript
,
this
may
not
be
enough
to
be
generalised
to
others
as
many
people
may
have
had
different
experiences
of
the
pandemic
therefore
this
can
be
different
for
every
individual
.
I
no
longer
would
like
to
carry
on
with
my
application
for
organisation
.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
.
.
Hello
,
I

I

this
helps
and
is
enough
to
help
me
stop
stressing
about
the
financial
hardship
I
am
facing
currently
.
Thank
you

you
are

I
wanted
to
ask
,
The
assignment
due
on
Friday
the
1564
of
October
,
I
wanted
to
know
if
the
5
day
extension
applies
to
this
assignment
.
I
have
seen
on
the
discussion
forum
that
you
have
previously
said
no
on
many
occasions
.
If
there
is
a
5
day
extension
would
you
mind
emailing
the
whole
year
group
as
we
are
all
struggling
to
finish
this
assignment
.

Hi
,
Thank
you
soo
much
!
This
is
very
helpful
and
puts
a
smile
to
our
bored
and
tired
faces
.
Isolating
for
2
weeks
with
no
family
near
you
is
really
long
especially
when
you
ca
n’t
even
see
your
friends
who
you
live
with
.
You
just
see
the
same
4
walls
in
your

There
is

living

Hi

That
would

We
ca
n’t
leave
the
house
to
do
any
shopping
so
I
was
wondering
how
much
are
the
food
parcels
?
And
chocolate
sounds
soo
good
at
the
moment
and
as
we
ca
n’t
leave
we
are
running
low
on
sanitary
products
therefore
a
period
pack
would
be
soo
beneficial
at
this
point
.
Thank
you
again
soo
much
for
helping
us

Yo
Slim
we
have
a
situation
about
going
Los
Angelos
this
weekend
Hello
,
For
your
trip
to
Helsinki
the
2nd
to
the
4th
of
September
i
have
various
items
planned
for
your
itinerary
:
-
First
a
hotel
by
the
harbour
that
costs
around
Â£103
per
night
and
is
centrally
located
making
it
easy
to
get
around
.
-
Secondly
there
is
a
cafe
called
'
Kaffa
Rostery
'
that
is
a
16
min
walk
away
,
a
bit
far
but
worth
it
for
some
good
coffee
and
breakfast
,
-
There
is
also
the
Finnish
Museum
of
Natural
History
only
a
21
min
walk
away
or
a
6
min
cab
to
get
to
for
you
to
be
able
to
explore
the
city
's
history
.
-
A
restaurant
called
'
Konstan
MÃ¶ljÃ¤
'
for
you
to
dine
at
,
9
mins
away
from
your
hotel
walking
or
only
3
mins
by
taxi
with
typical
dishes
like
reindeer
and
carelian
stew
to
try
.
-
Hietalahti
flea
market
for
you
to
buy
a
souvenir
from
for
your
children
,
with
good
reviews
and
a
naturally
finnish
feel
to
it
.
-
Finally
in
the
evening
there
are
various
live
music
bars
to
go
to
,
one
called
Iggy
's
bar
which
is
only
open
friday
and
saturday
evening
from
5
-
11pm
and
is
a
7
min
drive
away
or
a
17
min
walk
.
Another
option
is
the
Elmun
Baari
bar
,
with
good
reviews
,
a
little
closer
to
your
hotel
and
a
refreshing
view
of
the
sea
.
These
items
will
ensure
an
enjoyable
trip
for
your
on
your
2
-
day
conference
to
Helsinki
.

Middle
managers
have
four
main
roles
within
an
organization
that
they
are
tasked
with
in
order
to
bring
the
firm
success
.
Good
middle
managers
should
be
sense
makers
of
strategy
and
so
explain
and
simplify
what
the
strategic
goals
of
the
firm
are
,
adaptors
of
strategy
and
so
react
to
changes
in
the
industry
environment
.
They
should
also
be
local
leaders
meaning
that
they
lead
and
direct
those
on
lower
levels
to
them
while
also
being
champions
of
strategic
issues
,
going
around
the
firm
resolving
and
communicating
the
relevant
issues
to
top
management
.
A
critical
role
of
middle
managers
in
strategy
is
sense
making
,
as
detailed
in
a
report
by
Burgelman
,
this
was
the
case
with
Nokia
and
can
lead
to
a
firms
eventual
demise
.
Incumbent
firms
use
incremental
change
,
continuing
with
the
practices
that
have
made
them
so
successful
in
the
past
,
until
the
reach
a
flux
.
At
this
point
managers
are
unsure
of
what
to
do
as
they
have
fallen
so
far
behind
market
trends
and
resultantly
if
they
do
not
start
transformational
change
then
they
may
die
.
This
theory
can
be
useful
for
incumbent
firms
to
recognise
the
faults
that
they
can
make
but
should
be
wary
that
the
theory
is
not
as
simple
as
it
seems
.
As
in
the
Nokia
case
,
it
took
a
few
years
before
the
firm
really
started
seeing
the
negative
results
from
not
adapting
to
the
times
and
as
a
result
the
theory
may
be
seen
as
too
simplistic
in
truly
addressing
the
heart
of
the
issue
.
A
final
key
point
that
incumbent
firms
could
learn
from
Nokia
is
that
they
can
not
become
arrogant
and
must
keep
managers
humble
so
as
to
mitigate
the
overestimation
of
one
’s
capabilities
.
There
was
a
lack
of
concern
from
the
top
,
consistent
within
the
middle
levels
of
management
that
the
iPhone
was
no
threat
to
them
.
This
sentiment
arose
from
the
feelings
that
the
firm
was
invincible
due
to
its
market
leadership
and
RandD
strength
where
it
had
invested
over
$
50
billion
over
two
decades
.
The
overzealousness
of
the
managers
would
lead
to
an
incorrect
assessment
of
the
threat
of
competition
,
and
lead
to
an
eventual
decline
of
the
firm
.
Incumbent
firms
should
take
this
example
and
remain
sober
minded
with
regards
to
competition
and
learn
from
Nokia
the
effects
that
disruptive
innovation
can
have
.
Colly
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
accepting
,
sorry
it
is
so
late
though
!
Here
is
a
link
to
the
application
form
,
with
information
about
Referee
Letters
in
Section
12
:
Many
thanks
Theo
and
see
you
tomorrow
,
.
Hello
dear
lecturers
,
I
come
to
you
all
with
a
request
that
is
rather
last
minute
.
I
have
just
found
out
about
a
scholarship
to
study
Hebrew
after
University
,
with
a
placement
included
.
In
short
,
this
opportunity
requires
3
reference
letters
from
academics
I
know
.
Each
reference
must
be
provided
in
its
own
sealed
envelope
with
the
referee
’s
signature
across
the
seal
,
all
in
English
,
sent
to
the
following
address
:
organisation
I
building
I
2523
road
I
Dallas
7983
However
,
the
caveat
is
that
I
found
out
about
this
opportunity
just
today
and
the
deadline
for
references
and
applications
is
this
Friday
the
8258
of
December
.
As
a
result
,
I
realise
that
this
may
be
an
unrealistic
ask
of
you
all
to
complete
these
reference
letters
and
send
them
off
in
the
coming
days
.
Although
,
I
extremely
motivated
in
applying
for
this
opportunity
,
hence
why
I
am
asking
you
all
even
still
.
Do
not
worry
if
you
can
not
write
and
send
off
the
reference
letters
before
the
705
of
December
,
or
do
not
want
to
,
I
completely
understand
given
the
unrealistic
nature
of
my
request
.
However
,
if
you
are
all
able
to
,
I
would
be
utmost
grateful
.
Many
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
email
and
replying
,
I
am
truly
grateful
.
I
will
be
available
all
day
today
and
the
rest
of
the
week
if
you
all
want
to
contact
me
or
have
any
questions
reservations
about
my
request
.
Many
thanks
again
,
and
I
wish
you
all
well
,
.
Hello
Jillane
,
In
response
to
your
last
email
about
getting
proof
of
postage
,
you
can
in
fact
email
them
the
Referee
letter
instead
.
Would
this
be
easier
for
you
?
Or
would
you
still
like
to
send
the
referee
letter
via
post
?
Either
way
if
this
could
be
done
before
Saturday
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
Do
n't
hesitate
in
contacting
me
if
you
have
any
questions
.
Many
thanks
,
.
him
u
mean
?
?
No
,
for
him
is
correct

Ahh

we
are

for

...
Talk

that
's

True
a
to
do
list
would
be
a
good
idea
!
That
would
be
nice
but
I
'm
not
so
sure
about
it
,
I
'll
see
if
I
can
get
back
on
track
this
week
with
work
and
I
'll
let
you
know
:)
I
got
the
mentoring
scheme
!
!
!
My
mentor
is
my
top
pick
too
,
Heinz
-
even
with
a
Mandarin
email
aha
!
!
So
v
glad
,
I
'll
be
emailing
her
tomorrow
and
let
you
know
how
it
goes

Taking
into

the

Hi
organisation
,
I
appreciate
i
did
not
attend
a
booked
session
,
once
,
though
I
think
that
I
have
received
this
same
email
4
times
now
.
I
will
no
longer
miss
booked
sessions
,
and
so
if
this
same
email
could
stop
being
sent
to
me
I
would
be
much
appreciative
.
Many
thanks
and
kind
regards
,

Hello

I
have
now
received
this
same
email
about
7
times

again
,
but
would
appreciate
it
if
you
stopped
sending
this
same
email
.

Hi

I
hope

Thank
you
for
sending
this
to
me

albeit
i
have
already
declined
the

constraints

.
though
i
have
said
i
may
be
open
to
do
it
in

two
,
when
i
have
less

Hiya
pops
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
and
advice
on
this
,
I
think
it
'll
make
a
big
difference
to
my
application
.
I
've
just
sent
off
the
application
,
just
made
some
corrections
and
cleaned
it
up
before
I
sent
it
off
,
so
I
did
n't
change
it
too
much
as
I
did
n't
think
it
was
necessary
.
Thanks

lots
of

To
whom
it
may
concern
,
Attached
is
my
application
for
the
Mentoring
Scheme
I
was
put
forward
for
.
However
,
on
the
email
I
was
sent
the
dates
of
the
mentoring
scheme
were
for
1868
and
not
4836
,
and
thus
,
is
the
Scheme
running
this
year
?
Or
was
there
just
a
spelling
error
?
Many
thanks

Hello
Odette
,
I
hope
that
you
are
doing
well
.
My
name
is
.
,
and
we
were
in
contact
about
a
year
or
so
ago
about
an
internship
in
Houston
.
I
am
now
about
to
graduate
from
University
and
am
currently
searching
for
opportunities
abroad
in
topic
success
.
I
was
wondering
if
at
your
firm
there
were
any
internships
or
formal
fixed
positions
available
,
and
if
there
were
i
would
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
apply
.
Attached
is
my
English
C.V.
if
you
were
interested
in
my
experience
and
background
.
Many
thanks
and
I
hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
,

Hello
Lebbie
,
No
worries
thank
you
for
such
a
swift
reply
.
Indeed
,
topic
is
the
main
area
of
interest
for
me
at
the
moment
.
I
feel
my
experience
in
business
is
rather
similar
to
the
role
i
could
play
within
your
firm
-
working
mainly
in
English
for
large
clients
with
Spanish
speakers
in
the
office
and
liasing
with
clients
to
establish
networks
especially
internationally
given
my
prowess
in
languages
and
communication
,
my
bilinguilism
in
Russian
could
also
be
an
asset
to
you
given
the
desire
to
expand
your
market
into
other
countries
.
I
hope
this
clarifies
my
expectations
and
desire
to
be
a
part
of
a
firm
that
serves
international
clients
in
multiple
languages
in
a
sector
that
is
creative
and
diverse
.
Kindest
regards

Good
afternoon
,
Thank
you
for
setting
up
the
claim
.
Attached
are
3
photos
,
one
is
the
receipt
for
one
of
the
speakers
that
was
stolen
,
it
is
in
the
name
of
my
sister
Charla
as
she
is
the
one
that
bought
the
speaker
for
me
as
a
Christmas
present
.
The
other
two
are
the
only
photo
of
the
other
speaker
we
have
,
one
of
the
photo
as
a
whole
and
the
next
a
zoom
in
on
the
speaker
.
Would
these
be
enough
to
constitute
proof
of
purchase
for
both
speakers
?
Kind
regards
,
.
Hello

Good
to
hear

moment
and
so
any
more
information
on
possible
routes
to
take
would
be
most
appreciated

It
sounds
like
an
interesting
topic
from
an
experienced
professional
,
thank
you
for
inviting
me
along
.
To
register
,
need
I
just
send
an

Good
afternoon

It
has
come
to
my
understanding
that
i

department
today

is
this
indeed
the
case
?
If
so
,
sorry
for
missing

hope
we
can
be
in

again
soon
to
move
forward
with
this
claim

question
with

coursework
;
for
the

-
reflection
section
of

800

should
we

rather
,
is
it
better
to
answer
the

Could

Hello
Shani
,
My
name
is
.
,
and
it
is
really
exciting
to
have
been
allocated
as
your
mentee
.
I
am
currently
studying
course
at
university
and
I
'm
currently
in
second
term
of
my
final
year
,
I
am
also
bilingual
in
Hebrew
!
It
would
be
great
to
find
out
more
about
yourself
and
I
wondered
whether
you
would
be
free
to
meet
virtually
or
have
a
telephone
conversation
at
some
point
soon
?
I
am
currently
most
free
on
Tuesday
afternoons
,
Sunday
and
Wednesday
all
day
.
Or
if
you
are
n't
available
those
days
,
we
can
look
at
another
time
that
suits
you
better
.
Looking
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
.
Kind
Regards
,
.
Hi
Zeb
,
With
regards
to
our
previous
conversation
last
week
,
I
was
wondering
if
you
had
any
updates
on
the
speakers
that
were
stolen
from
our
flat
.
You
had
mentioned
last
week
that
someone
might
look
over
the
CCTV
footage
?
I
was
wondering
if
that
had
produced
any
results
or
not
?
Many
thanks
and
kind
regards
,
.
Dear
Herby
,
Thank
you
for
your
continued
support
during
this
difficult
time
,
it
is
much
appreciated
!
I
do
have
one
question
however
with
regards
to
the
university
if
you
could
help
me
.
I
was
wondering
,
is
the
University
planning
on
implementing
a
no
detriment
policy
this
year
or
not
?
As
i
know
various
universities
have
already
done
this
,
however
many
have
not
.
Are
the
only
measurements
to
be
taken
by
university
,
with
regards
to
a
'
safety
net
'
as
such
,
to
be
the
5
-
day
extension
on
exams
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
Jacinta
,
I
hope
you
are
well
,
I
'm
.
from
the
module
module
you
teach
.
Attached
are
my
answers
to
the
mock
exam
,
in
preparation
for
the
real
one
next
week
.
Just
a
few
questions
:
In
the
multiple
choice
section
of
the
mock
test
,
why
is
the
answer
to
question
1
topic
,
and
not
topic
?
The
answer
given
to
question
no
.
7
in
the
multiple
choice
questions
seems
to
be
wrong
,
as
to
achieve
sustained
competitive
advantage
,
a
firm
must
be
non
-
imitable
,
not
imitable
,
if
I
'm
correct
?
My
answers
to
the
open
questions
do
n't
seem
,
to
me
at
least
,
to
have
much
substance
,
I
'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
them
well
.
I
wrote
them
both
in
25
-
30mins
,
although
i
do
n't
think
i
did
very
well
.
Could
you
give
me
some
direction
as
to
what
i
need
to
do
to
improve
,
and
how
to
best
tackle
these
questions
when
it
comes
to
the
real
exam
?
Many
thanks
and
if
we
could
review
my
open
questions
together
via
teams
,
before
the
real
exam
,
that
would
be
ideal
.
Kindest
regards
,
.

😵
😵
x
I
'm
ok
!
Had
a
good
dinner
that
the
flatmates
made
for
me
and
then
watched
a
series
with
Lorita
.
It
's
tough
,
but
I
realise
more
and
more
I
'm
not
the
only
who
is
suffering
mentally
-
so
many
others
do
too
.
So
I
'll
be
ok
:)
x
would
b
v
expensive
to
fix
?
No
worries
,
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
glad
to
have
come
home
was
so
relaxing
and
nice
to
see
everyone
after
a
while
.
Arrived
back
in
the
flat
so
all
is
well
with
me
!
:))

a
Rory
,
No
worries
!
Attached
are
some
of
my
revisions
but
not
sure
I
'm
correct
in
all
of
them
so
feel
free
to
debate
it
,
and
i
think
my
word
changed
some
of
the
formatting
randomly
so
please
ignore
that
.
A
good
piece
of
work
i
think
tho
,
so
do
n't
worry
so
!
Hope
it
's
of
help

Hi
Barbabra
,
Sorry
i
completely
forgot
to
ask
this
in
the
webinar
today
,
however
,
i
was
wondering
with
regards
to
the
coursework
on
the
business
case
study
whether
it
was
necessary
or
not
to
do
any
additional
research
on
business
and
it
's
failings
?
Or
if
all
that
we
need
on
business
is
in
the
case
study
itself
?
Kind
regards
,
.
Hi
Gifford
,
Hope
you
are
well
and
enjoying
your
weekend
.
I
just
had
another
question
on
the
Coursework
,
thanks
for
your
earlier
reply
,
i
was
just
wondering
with
regards
to
referencing
how
many
references
we
had
to
include
and
to
what
depth
?
This
is
because
the
majority
of
my
points
will
be
derived
from
the
case
study
given
to
us
.
Possibly
only
referencing
our
further
readings
and
theories
Merci
!
.
Thank
you
very
much
Jocelyne
,
that
's
kind
of
you
to
pass
on
the
job
request
's
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
I
'll
be
sure
to
complete
the
feedback
form
too
!
Kind
regards
,
.
Hello
Nata
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
getting
back
to
me
with
my
marks
so
quickly
!
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
module
and
felt
supported
all
the
way
.
I
am
also
now
looking
into
jobs
in
topic
partly
because
of
this
module
,
so
i
thank
you
very
much
for
teaching
me
this
past
term
.
Best
regards
,
.
Hello
Kenton
,
My
name
is
.
and
i
was
in
your
module
class
in
my
first
year
at
university
,
so
three
years
ago
,
and
i
am
now
in
my
final
year
and
am
about
to
graduate
in
the
coming
weeks
from
university
in
course
.
My
hope
after
graduation
is
to
find
work
,
or
study
in
Russia
in
the
year
to
come
,
and
see
what
options
are
available
to
me
at
this
point
.
As
a
result
,
i
was
just
wondering
if
it
were
possible
to
have
a
call
,
or
even
a
meeting
within
the
University
,
to
talk
over
what
options
exist
as
i
remember
in
my
first
year
you
recommended
various
schemes
to
study
out
in
Mexico
.
I
am
available
anytime
as
i
no
longer
have
lectures
and
am
only
revising
for
exams
.
If
not
then
no
worries
at
all
.
I
hope
that
you
are
well
and
thank
you
for
your
time
,
Kind
regards
,
.
Dear
Valdemar
,
Many
thanks
for
your
swift
response
and
information
-
all
of
those
links
are
very
useful
especially
organisation
.
14:00
tomorrow
is
perfect
for
a
call
for
me
,
i
think
i
will
still
take
you
up
on
the
offer
as
i
have
some
more
questions
to
ask
if
possible
,
although
these
links
so
far
are
definitely
very
useful
to
start
my
search
.
Many
thanks
and
speak
tomorrow
,
.
Hi
Winni
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
such
a
kind
email
,
and
your
persistant
and
encouraging
teaching
throughout
the
years
!
It
has
definitely
inspired
me
to
always
question
things
,
and
to
think
about
situations
in
a
different
light
.
I
am
deeply
sorry
about
the
organisation
situation
,
but
for
now
i
'll
focus
on
these
last
few
exams
,
like
jocko
says
,
we
need
just
'
Get
after
it
'
!
Thank
you
ever
so
and
grateful
to
have
had
you
as
a
teacher
.
Kind
regards
,
.
No
worries
,
and
thanks
for
the
share
I
'll
definitely
have
a
look
!
This
is
perfect
as
well
as
I
've
been
looking
for
podcasts
to
listen
to
,
sounds
like
a
one
of
a
kind
podcast
.
I
have
n't
yet
-
will
be
applying
to
jobs
full
time
after
exams
,
so
I
'll
bear
that
in
mind
,
thanks
for
offering
to
be
a
referee
of
mine
,
truly
appreciated
!
Best
regards
,
.
ill
do
!
Thank
you
so
much
Delores
:)

Hi
Claus
,
Sorry
this
is
late
!
The
application
is
all
done
on
their
website
and
so
not
everything
can
be
sent
on
one
document
-
but
I
think
that
these
two
sections
are
the
most
pertinent
to
your
reference
.
I
hope
this
helps
!
.
Indeed
I
wo
n't
,
I
'm
just
reviewing
certain
parts
of
it
now
,
I
'll
send
it
to
you
by
14:00
if
that
works
?
Thanks
again
,
.
Hi
Emalia
,
Sure
,
that
works
,
no
worries
!
.
Hello
again
dear
Lecturers
,
Sorry
again
for
the
tardiness
,
but
for
the
final
part
of
my
application
,
they
need
your
contact
details
:
Name
Position
with
me
on
a
team
's
meeting
?
I
ask
just
as
it
seems
on
system
at
least
you
have
no
hours
on
that
day
,
and
i
was
wondering
if
that
was
the
case
still
.
16:00
would
be
ideal
for
me
on
that
Friday
but
if
you
can
not
then
please
do
tell
me
your
availability
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Thanks
mamá
,
indeed
it
's
going
ok
:)

No
worries
if
you
're
busy
!
Was
gon
na
be
a
quick
call
anyway
-
had
a
good
call
with
my
client
just
now
,
tomorrow
I
'm
going
to
do
my
exam
Have
n't
done
it
yet
!
I
actually
have
a
couple
of
days
,
so
taking
my
time
because
apparently
it
's
very
hard
aha
...
otherwise
got
another
result
back
from
November
-
got
80
%
in
an
exam
!
!
And
with
the
79
%
from
module
,
a
first
could
b
possible
!
!
Maybe
just
maybe
!
!
😊

Thanks
for
the
answers
,
really
clarified
a
lot
of
things
!
To
decide
on
the
specific
personality
traits
I
wish
to
study
,
I
've
summarised
the
traits
that
each
study
looks
at
in
a
table
.
However
,
not
every
study
looks
at
one
or
two
of
the
same
traits
.
So
,
I
'm
not
sure
which
traits
to
specifically
look
at
.
Could
you
look
at
the
table
and
help
me
decide
on
which
traits
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
look
at
based
on
this
table
?
Does
every
study
I
look
at
have
to
address
every
personality
trait
I
've
chosen
to
look
at
?
Also
,
after
looking
at
the
study
again
,
I
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me

Hi
Elicia
,
after
conducting
some
research
,
I
ca
n't
seem
to
find
any
relevance
of
suggestibility
with
agreeableness
-
or
any
other
personality
trait
for
that
matter
so
I
've
decided
to
exclude
the
paper
.
I
've
created
a
study
characteristics
table
including
the
effect
sizes
of
each
trait
in
each
study
.
Could
you
please
have
a
quick
look
and
let
me
know
if
it
's
appropriate
?
Furthermore
,
do
I
need
to
indicate
which
effect
sizes
were
significant
and
insignificant
?
If
so
,
how
would
I
go
about
doing
that
?
note
:
I
've
left
the
traits
that
specific
studies
do
n't
report
on
blank
.
Is
there
a
better
way
to
show
this
in
a
table
or
is
that
ok
?
Please
let
me
know
if
I
've
missed
anything
that
should
be
included
in
this
table
.
Many
thanks
,
.
please
can
u
look
over
this
and
lmk
what
you

Expression
of
emotion
is
one
of
the
key
ways
in
which
humans
communicate
with
one
another
and
this
expression
is
executed
in
many
ways
through
tone
of
voice
,
body
language
.
Therefore
,
in
line
with
the
previous
meta
-
analytic
study
discussed
in
this
essay
,
the
findings
of
this
study
also
suggest
that
individuals
with
autism
struggle
recognising
facial
displays
of
emotion
,
especially
negative
emotion
.
Thus
,
with
research
that
strongly
supports
the
notion
that
mental
illnesses
play
a
role
in
influencing
recognition
of
facial
displays
of
behaviour
,
the
notion
that
this
phenomenon
is
not
universal
but
rather
dependent
on
many
factors
is
proven
to
be
more
credible
.
Overall
,
the
non
-
universality
of
correct
recognition
of
facial
displays
of
emotion
is
widely
researched
.
The
factors
discussed
in
this
essay
all
influence
emotion
recognition
of
facial
displays
in
distinct
ways
;
it
seems
individuals
from
different
cultures
perceive
facial
emotions
differently
,
women
,
more
than
men
,
are
more
likely
to
correctly
recognise
facial
displays
of
emotion
and
autistic
individuals
generally
have
a
difficulty
in
distinguishing
and
thus
recognising
different
emotions
.
It
also
important
to
note
that
while
emotion
recognition
of
faces
can
involve
either
positive
or
negative
emotions
,
it
is
more
often
the
case
that
these
factors
play
a
bigger
role
when
individuals
are
required
to
distinguish
between
negative
faces
rather
than
positive
ones
.
That
is
,
non
-
universality
of
correct
recognition
of
facial
displays
of
emotion
is
more
evident
in
negative
emotions
than
positive
ones
.
that
's
fine
.
Yeah

you

Hi
Leilah
,
are
you
available
for
a

today
?
I
would
book
through

but
I
have
been
having
this
recurring
problem
where
I
ca
n't
get
it
to
work
.
I
'm
available
at
any
time
today
so
whenever
suits
you
best
would
be
good
.
Kind

Hi
Prasad
,
thank
you
for
the
chat
today
,
it
cleared
up
a
lot
of
things
for
me
!
Here
are
the
papers
I
needed
you
to
look
over
:
The
Horselenberg
paper
conducts
a
Pearson
correlation
with
two
other
values
,
kappa
and
x
-
squared
.
In
the
Rasmussen
paper
,
in
both
studies
,
they
look
at
different
aspects
of
topic
,
so
just
wanted
to
confirm
that
to
get
effect
size
for
overall
topic
and
topic
,
do
I
pool
the
different
effect
sizes
together
?
Lastly
,
I
forgot
to
ask
this
during
our
call
,
but
once
I
've
completed
them
,
would
you
be
able
to
look
at
the
different
sections
of
my
dissertation
and
provide
some
feedback
?
I
really
appreciate
the
help
once
again
.
Kind
Regards
,
.
Hi
Anissa
,
Just
wanted
to
write
a
quick
email
to
personally
thank
you
for
releasing
a
longer
,
more
simplified
version
of
the
Week
3
lecture
.
It
was
much
easier
to
understand
and
made
me
less
worried
about
the
module
as
a
whole
.
I
appreciate
the
time
it
takes
to
make
longer
asynchronous
content
so
I
'm
grateful
that
you
took
our
feedback
on
board
and
made
the
lectures
more
easy
to
understand
.
If
you
do
n't
mind
,
I
'd
like
to
make
a
suggestion
regarding
the
first
two
lectures
of
the
module
.
I
think
I
,
along
with
other
students
studying
the
module
,
would
really
appreciate
if
you
released
another
video
of
the
first
two
lectures
,
just
further
explaining
and
simplifying
the
content
as
with
the
existing
30
min
asynchronous
videos
,
it
's
quite
difficult
to
grasp
a
full
understanding
of
the
concepts
discussed
in
those
lectures
.
I
understand
that
making
these
asynchronous
chunks
can
be
quite
time
consuming
and
that
you
may
have
still
yet
to
recordrelease
the
weeks
4
and
5
content
,
so
I
think
it
would
be
reasonable
if
you
released
them
after
the
module
content
has
been
fully
covered
.
I
also
realise
that
we
have
quite
some
time
left
till
our
summer
exams
so
there
is
no
rush
to
release
the
videos
any
sooner
.
I
hope
my
feedback
makes
sense
and
once
again
,
thank
you
for
taking
it
on
board
.
It
's
much
appreciated
!
Kind
Regards
,
.

Student

Hi
Oralle
,
Hope
you
had
a
great
Christmas
and
happy
new
year
!
I
am
currently
working
on
the
methods
section
of
my
dissertation
and
while
I
was
conducting
a
final
literature
search
,
I
came
across
a
few
studies
that
looked
at
topic
instead
of
topic
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
these
are
relevant
enough
to
topic
.
Also
,
many
of
these
studies
involve
a
DRM
paradigm
task
that
is
used
to
specifically
assess
topic
.
I
looked
into
the
paradigm
and
while
it
does
involve
topic
,
which
I
have
included
as
one
of
my
inclusion
criteria
,
I
'm
not
sure
if
it
is
still
relevant
to
what
I
'm
investigating
.
I
also
wanted
to
ask
if
I
had
to
justify
some
of
the
keywords
I
had
used
?
For
example
,
would
I
have
to
state
why
I
included
studies
that
looked
at
topic
instead
of
specifically
topic
?
And
if
topic
do
prove
to
be
relevant
,
would
I
have
to
provide
a
justification
as
to
how
they
relate
to
topic
too
?
Sorry
for
a
lengthy
email
but
I
'm
just
a
little
unsure
.
Many
thanks
,
.
Thanks
for
your
response
,
it
was
really
helpful
!
With
the
narrow
search
,
after
the
exclusions
,
I
have
7
papers
.
I
am
not
sure
if
that
would
be
enough
?
Also
,
I
do
n't
understand
some
of
the
sub
-
sections
in
the
PRISMA
guidelines
.
I
've
attached
the
document
with
the
sections
I
do
n't
understand
highlighted
in
red
.
If
possible
,
would
you
be
able
to
further
explain
them
to
me
,
please
?
Many
thanks
,

Hi
Johnathon
,
hope
you
've
been
well
.
I
just
had
a
few
questions
regarding
the
results
section
of
my
dissertation
.
Specifically
,
about
effect
sizes
.
I
just
wanted
to
ask
how
do
I
calculate
effect
sizes
?
I
searched
up
the
definition
and
the
different
types
of
effect
sizes
online
,
but
it
left
me
a
little
bit
confused
.
If
a
study
has
conducted
a
correlational
test
is
it
okay
for
me
to
use
the
r
value
of
that
test
as
the
effect
size
?
I
also
noticed
that
some
studies
calculated
their
own
effect
sizes
after
conducting
a
correlational
test
.
Do
I
use
those
effect
sizes
instead
of
the
r
value
generated
from
the
tests
?
Do
I
report
effect
sizesr
values
that
proved
to
be
insignificant
?
Do
I
report
any
multiple
regression
analyses
done
by
studies
?
Also
,
some
studies
have
just
provided
the
descriptive
statistics
for
the
different
variables
.
How
do
I
calculate
the
effect
size
from
the
mean
and
standard
deviation
?
Also
,
should
I
just
look
at
studies
that
perform
a
correlational
statistic
test
that
evaluate
the
strength
of
a
relationship
between
two
variables
,
or
would
it
be
okay
for
me
to
look
at
studies
that
also
conduct
other
statistical
tests
such
as
chi
-
squared
?
How
do
I
calculate
the
overall
effect
size
from
a
range
of
effect
sizes
?
Would
it
be
the
same
way
as
calculating
a
mean
value
from
a
range
of
values
?
Finally
,
what
is
the
difference
between
r
and
r
-
squared
values
?
For
now
,
I
've
tried
to
note
down
all
the
r
values
of
the
studies
that
do
conduct
correlational
tests
and
left
out
the
studies
that
do
n't
,
but
I
wanted
to
be
sure
if
what
I
was
doing
was
correct
before
moving
on
to
the
next
step
.
Sorry
for
the
lengthy
email
once
again
.
Kind
Regards
,

Police
interviewing
with
eyewitnesses
and
victims
has
always
been
subject
to
scrutiny
by
psychologists
and
legal
professionals
.
Over
the
past
years
,
there
has
been
significant
psychological
research
in
this
area
,
with
various
new
techniques
being
introduced
and
implemented
in
police
training
to
ensure
testimonies
of
eyewitnesses
,
victims
,
and
suspects
to
be
as
accurate
as
possible
.
While
these
techniques
can
be
applied
to
both
eyewitnesses
and
suspects
,
victims
of
crime
need
particular
care
and
consideration
when
being
interviewed
about
the
crime
.
One
example
of
such
victims
are
sexual
assault
victims
.
Studies
have
shown
that
only
16
-
20
%
of
rape
victims
report
the
crime
to
the
police
or
other
legal
justice
systems
.
This
approach
involves
anonymous
and
confidential
written
reporting
options
for
sexual
assault
victims
commonly
before
a
traditional
interview
.
An
example
of
a
WRIP
approach
could
be
that
victims
of
sexual
assault
write
their
story
in
their
own
time
–
whenever
they
feel
ready
–
with
prompts
and
guidelines
designed
to
focus
their
writing
on
key
points
as
well
as
maximise
their
recall
.
This
written
format
can
then
be
followed
up
with
a
formal
interview
.
In
terms
of
anonymous
reporting
,
a
WRIP
that
aims
to
achieve
this
should
include
instructions
that
are
consistent
with
the
Cognitive
Interview
techniques
.
For
instance
,
a
WRIP
for
confidential
reporting
must
begin
with
an
‘
Engage
and
Explain
’
phase
that
includes
the
Cognitive
Interview
’s
‘
report
everything
’
phase
.
While
still
remaining
anonymous
,
it
is
important
to
still
engage
with
the
interviewee
,
to
show
sensitivity
to
them
.
Thus
,
it
is
evident
that
this
approach
allows
police
interviewers
to
have
a
lot
of
flexibility
when
interviewing
sexual
assault
victims
.
With
the
WRIP
approach
,
many
of
the
Cognitive
Interview
limitations
are
addressed
.
By
allowing
victims
to
record
their
experiences
themselves
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
crime
,
the
police
interviewers
can
use
those
initial
reports
for
reference
during
the
face
-
to
-
face
interview
phase
,
reducing
the
cognitive
demands
imposed
on
them
by
the
interview
technique
and
reducing
the
time
it
takes
to
conduct
a
full
interview
.
Furthermore
,
by
incorporating
these
two
techniques
together
,
the
victims
’
satisfaction
levels
,
rapport
building
,
and
the
quality
of
their
testimonies
are
not
compromised
,
rather
they
are
further
encouraged
.
However
,
it
is
vital
to
note
that
there
has
been
no
further
research
on
the
combination
of
these
two
techniques
and
their
validity
in
real
life
situations
.
Nevertheless
,
theoretically
,
this
collaboration
appears
to
be
the
‘
Golden
Standard
’
and
‘
fool
-
proof
’
in
the
context
of
investigative
interviewing
.
Therefore
,
with
such
considerations
in
mind
,
the
combinations
of
these
techniques
should
be
considered
as
a
practice
for
gathering
evidence
from
sexual
assault
victims
.
In
conclusion
,
interviewing
sexual
assault
victims
is
tricky
.
Regardless
of
age
,
gender
,
size
,
etc
.
reflecting
and
talking
about
such
traumatic
events
is
not
easy
for
any
individual
.
It
is
possible
that
it
is
because
of
this
sensitivity
of
the
topic
that
many
victims
are
reluctant
to
come
forward
and
report
the
crimes
done
to
them
.
Nevertheless
,
it
is
the
legal
justice
system
’s
responsibility
that
they
have
such
measures
in
place
that
allow
the
victims
to
feel
even
a
little
bit
of
comfort
when
coming
forward
.
It
is
the
police
’s
responsibility
to
ensure
the
victims
feel
as
if
they
made
the
right
choice
by
reporting
the
crime
.
Considering
some
of
the
factors
that
might
prevent
victims
from
coming
forward
,
this
essay
proposes
two
main
recommendations
that
the
police
could
potentially
introduce
in
their
practice
.
Both
of
these
recommendations
have
a
key
thing
in
common
–
building
rapport
.
Thus
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
in
any
type
of
investigative
interviewing
,
building
rapport
is
the
most
important
aspect
.

Hi
Warden
,
Hope
you
're
doing
well
!
I
've
been
trying
to
book
an
appointment
with
you
through
system
but
for
some
reason
,
it
's
not
letting
me
log
in
to
the
system
.
So
,
would
it
be
possible
to
make
an
appointment
with
you
via
email
?
I
am
available
at
11
am
on

Would
that
time
work
for
you
?

Yep
,
it

.
See
you
tomorrow
🙂
Hi
Agustin
,
Yes
,
that
's
fine
!
The
only
issue
is
that
I
will
be
at
the
library
during
that
time
so
there
might
be
some
background
noise
.
I
do
n't
think
it
will
be
enough
to
interrupt
our
meeting
,
but
I
just
thought
I
should
let
you
know
beforehand
.
I
hope
that
is
n't
a
problem
?
3:10
would
be
perfect
,
thank
you

I
'm
currently
a
final

-
so
that
's
my
main
occupation
.
I
also
work
as
a
job_title
for
my
university
on
the
side
and
this
is
a
zero

hour
contract
role
.

Ideally
,
I
'd
prefer
a
job
that
is
part
-
time
so
I
can
juggle
my
studies
alongside
it
.
I
can
consider
a
full
-
time
role
once
I
learn
more
about
what
the
role
specifically
requires
and
how
many
hours
I
would
be
required
to
work

Hi

I
received

have

I
must
have
somehow
missed
it
-
sorry
about
that

I
would
be
interested
in
a
meet
and
greet
with
your
manager

What
time
tomorrow
would
you
be
able
to
arrange
the
meeting
?
Also
,
would
you
advise
any
planning
ahead
of
time
for
this
meeting

so

what
would
it

Hello
,
Just
for
clarification
,
does
this
mean
that
all
job_titles
that
are
on
the
system
only
release
pre
-
recorded
content
for
the
learners
and
do
not
have
any
live
sessions
with
the
learners
?
And
if
that
is
the
case
,
do
the
mentoring
session
dates
mark
the
dates
by
which
the
pre
-
recorded
content
needs
to
be
uploaded
by
?
Apologies
if
this
seems
like
you
're
having
to
repeat
yourselves
,
I
'm
just
a
little
confused
as
I
thought
I
would
just
be
delivering
live
sessions
only
.
Best
Regards
,
.
Hi
,
Thank
you
for
your
previous
email
-
it
really
helped
clear
up
a
lot
of
things
.
I
am
just
a
little
bit
stuck
on
what
to
record
for
the
very
first
session
.
As
the
mentoring
will
be
taking
place
in
a
pre
-
recorded
manner
,
I
'm
not
sure
if
many
of
the
topics
recommended
to
discuss
during
the
first
session
during
our
training
would
be
applicable
anymore
.
Do
you
think
it
would
be
okay
to
spend
a
few
minutes
introducing
myself
and
then
jumping
straight
onto
the
mentoring
aspect
and
covering
a
topic
from
the
GCSE
Maths
curriculum
?
Best
Regards
,
.
Okay
,
I
will
keep
that
in
mind
-
thank
you
for
confirming
!
Good
Morning
,
I
've
submitted
my
pre
-
recorded
video
and
the
lesson
plan
.
However
,
I
have
a
query
-
my
video
is
only
around
30
minutes
in
length
but
it
involves
the
students
pausing
quite
a
bit
in
the
middle
to
answer
questionsmake
notes
and
requires
them
to
watch
YouTube
videos
.
Furthermore
,
after
filling
out
the
lesson
plan
,
I
can
confirm
that
to
complete
one
session
,
it
will
take
them
1
hour
.
I
tried
my
best
to
make
it
as
long
as
possible
by
explaining
things
slowly
and
covering
several
topics
in
a
session
but
it
proved
quite
difficult
to
make
it
an
hour
long
.
So
,
I
just
wanted
to
confirm
if
a
30
min
video
is
acceptable
or
would
I
definitely
have
to
make
the
video
itself
an
hour
in
length
?
Also
,
would
I
need
to
fill
out
and
send
in
a
time
sheet
or
will
you
take
care
of
this
?
Best
Regards
,
.
ust
had
another
think
about
it
.
Would
I
just
present
the
forest
plot
for
each
trait
separately
?
I
think
that
makes
the
most
sense
…
Hi
Emmott
,
thanks
for
that
email
,
it
was
really
helpful
!
I
'm
computing
the
forest
plot
right
now
but
I
'm
a
little
stuck
on
recording
the
effect
sizes
for
each
study
.
Because
I
'm
looking
at
3
personality
traits
,
I
have
3
different
effect
sizes
to
report
for
each
study
.
How
would
I
go
about
doing
this
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi
,
As
I
'm
aware
the
pay
date
is
the
3766
of
each
month
and
I
worked
a
event
shift
on
Sunday
the
9843
of
June
from
8:30am
to
2:30pm
and
have
not
been
paid
for
that
yet
.
I
am
due
to
be
paid
£
62.52
.
Could
you
please
look
into
this
for
me
.
Regards
,
.
Sorry
for
bombarding
you
with
emails
but
I
think
it
'd
be
helpful
if
I
could
book
a
meeting
to
go
over
the
forest
plot
and
moderator
analysis
with
you
?
I
tried
the
forest
plot
but
it
did
n't
look
right
to
me
so
I
just
wanted
to
double
check
if
I
was
doing
it
right
.
As
I
'm
a
bit
tight
on
the
draft
deadline
,
I
'd
prefer
it
if
we
could
meet
asap
?
I
'm
free
all
day
tomorrow
except
2
-
4pm
and
,
Friday
except
10am-12pm
.
Hi
Merralee
,
Thanks
for
the
editing
the
spreadsheet
!
I
inputted
the
values
for
consc
and
agree
traits
into
it
but
the
forest
plot
for
those
do
n't
look
like
the
neuro
one
.
I
'm
not
sure
what
I
'm
doing
wrong
-
I
tried
editing
the
x
axis
scale
on
the
graph
but
it
still
would
n't
work
.
So
,
I
just
left
it
as
it
is
now
.
I
'm
attaching
the
two
spreadsheets
on
to
this
email
-
I
do
n't
know
if
you
want
to
have
another
meeting
to
walk
me
through
it
again
or
just
edit
it
yourself
?
I
'm
happy
with
either
,
just
want
to
do
whatever
suits
you
best
!
Hi
Charles
,
I
've
computed
the
mean
effect
sizes
for
each
group
for
the
task
type
moderator
variable
and
the
mean
standard
error
overall
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
what
to
do
after
that
point
?
.
Clinton
,
I
'd
like
to
have
a
final
meeting
with
you
this
coming
week
to
just
talk
about
some
final
points
regarding
my
dissertation
.
When
would
be
best
for
you
?
I
think
5:30pm
would
work
.
See
you
then
!
Thank
youuuuuuuuuuu
Perfect

you

Thank
you

I
just
had
one
final
q
-
do
we
need
to
have
Times
New
Roman
as
the
font
or
Calibri
Body
either
in
isolation
,
or
along
with
a
drug
treatment
such
as
Lisdexamfetamine
.
30
individuals
in
BED
no

treatment
group
and
30
BED
Lisdexamfetamine
group
will
be
recruited
.
Both
groups
will
be
shown
mukbang
videos
for
12
weeks
.
While
watching
the
videos
,
participants
will
be
placed
in
an
fMRI
scanner
and
brain
scans
pre-
and
post
-
mukbang
intervention
will
be
taken
to
compare
how
the
BOLD
response
changes
within-
and
between
-
groups
.
Kind
Regards
,
.
Sorry
about
that
!
I
'll
send
the
agree
one
now
.
I
tried
to
select
the
values
for
this
,
like
you
did
for
the
consc
one
,
but
for
some
reason
it
still
does
n't
seem
to
work
.
Also
,
I
noticed
another
issue
-
in
the
calculations
tab
,
I
inputted
the
values
for
the
pajon
and
walsh
study
but
when
I
click
on
the
forest
plot
tab
,
the
row
for
this
study
does
n't
appear
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
it
's
not
appearing
...
Hi
Zalman
,
I
was
a
little
confused
about
what
mixed
effects
model
estimate
you
were
referring
to
,
but
I
was
talking
to
Fiona
and
she
told
me
that
you
recommended
her
to
look
at
the
I2v
value
for
variability
and
if
it
's
high
,
to
use
the
"
random
"
box
values
and
if
it
's
low
,
to
use
the
"
fixed
"
box
values
.
So
,
I
also
did
the
same
for
my
moderator
analysis
-
I
'm
not
sure
if
that
is
what
you
were
referring
to
in
your
email
below
?
I
managed
to
compute
all
the
effect
sizes
and
standard
errors
,
using
the
above
method
,
and
formatted
them
in
a
table
below
.
Could
you
please
a
)
confirm
that
the
method
Audie
told
me
was
the
same
method
you
recommended
me
to
use
?
and
b
)
if
it
is
correct
,
look
at
the
values
in
the
table
and
suggest
any
possible
interpretations
I
could
make
as
I
'm
quite
confused
as
to
what
to
infer
from
these
results
?
Many
thanks
,
.
Hi

thank
you

I
have
finished

up
my
abstract

first
draft

feedback
,
could
you
please
let
me
know
:
a

if
the
overall
structure
for
my
dissertation
is
appropriate
b

if
it
would
be

Hi
Adela
,
Just
to
let
you
know
I
have
a
meeting
with
Barrie
before
our
meeting
so
worst
case
I
might
around
10
mins
late
.
Kind
regards
,
.
I
’ve
been
through
the
experiment
and
it
seems
to
work
fine
.
.
Hi
Domenico
,
Yeah
I
’m
fine
.
Hope
your
good
too
.
And
yeah
sure
I
’ll
do
the
experiment
and
then
get
back
to
you
.
Best

Hi
Joshua
,
Hope
you
’re
keeping
well
.
I
listened
to
this
podcast
recently
and
thought
you
’d
really
like
it
.
It
’s
all
about
responding
more
effectively
in
conversations
using
emotional
intelligence
.
So
whenever
you
get
some
time
to
yourself
I
would
highly
recommend
for
you
to
give
it
a
listen
when
you
have
some
time
.
Best
wishes

Hi
Agustin
,
Thanks
for
the
email
.
I
’m
quite
well
actually
.
The
weathers
been
really
nice
recently
so
there
’s
not
much
complain
about
there
.
I
try
to
get
out
at
least
once
daily
and
go
for
a
walk
to
enjoy
the
weather
or
just
to
get
out
of
the
monotony
of
being
stuck
at
home
.
My
placements
going
well
.
We
still
have
weekly
meetings
on
Monday
where
we
’re
usually
updated
with
what
different
members
of
the
group
are
doing
and
updates
with
their
research
.
I
still
have
close
contact
with
my
placement
supervisor
Gill
and
he
has
been
really
helpful
.
Also
,
I
do
contact
my
placement
tutor
Anstice
as
and
when
I
need
to
and
he
’s
been
really
supportive
as
well
.
I
have
a
presentation
task
that
I
’ve
been
given
to
present
a
piece
of
research
I
find
interesting
which
links
to
the
area
of
research
as
well
as
meeting
certain
criteria
.
Also
,
tomorrow
I
am
going
to
take
part
in
an
online
study
which
is
all
about
to
do
with
me
experience
studying
at
university
.
So
that
’s
my
update
.
What
about
you
Hulda
?
How
have
you
been
and
how
has
working
in
lockdown
and
recording
lectures
been
like
?
Kind

How
can
media
be
simultaneously
supporting
and
endangering
our
democracy
?
In
recent
years
,
there
has
been
a
profound
dispute
regarding
the
institution
of
media
and
the
part
it
plays
for
crippling
ethical
principles
within
a
democracy
.
My
argument
in
this
essay
is
that
both
these
processes
have
a
pivotal
role
to
play
in
facilitating
and
hindering
societal
growth
.
Regardless
of
these
,
we
should
work
to
fortify
this
institution
as
both
factors
are
necessary
for
the
growth
of
our
democracy
and
this
institution
has
a
fundamental
role
to
play
in
protecting
the
interests
of
all
citizens
as
well
as
promoting
equality
.
The
power
of
media
has
been
constantly
viewed
in
terms
of
the
ability
of
a
single
individual
or
group
to
enforce
order
and
command
authority
over
a
vast
number
,
enabling
the
entity
to
hold
power
over
something
like
a
media
environment
with
ease
.
Media
can
not
hold
power
over
individuals
of
its
own
accord
,
it
requires
the
strategic
implementation
of
information
from
a
combination
of
areas
compiled
into
one
place
which
then
goes
on
to
infiltrate
all
elements
of
social
life
.
Conclusively
,
the
relationship
between
media
and
democracy
is
extensive
and
far
-
reaching
.
Power
,
being
ubiquitous
in
nature
,
seeps
into
the
depths
of
media
outlets
and
political
institutions
such
as
democracy
.
The
power
of
media
transcends
merely
control
and
is
something
far
more
perplexing
.
Even
though
we
can
see
ways
that
media
can
assist
and
hinder
democracy
,
its
actual
role
is
far
greater
and
bewildering
.
I
propose
that
more
research
is
needed
into
the
true
nature
of
media
and
the
way
that
its
role
functionally
relates
to
different
institutions
,
as
well
as
the
devastating
impact
it
can
have
on
society
.
Hi
,
These
are
all
the
details
on
your
itinerary
for
your
two
day
trip
.
First
of
all
the
hotel
that
I
have
selected
is
called
the
Hilton
Helsinki
stand
.
It
's
a
beautiful
4
star
waterfront
hotel
1
km
away
from
the
city
centre
,
within
your
budget
of
Â£200
.
It
is
Â£116
per
night
.
The
hotel
does
come
with
a
cafe
,
restaurant
and
souvenir
shop
but
should
you
need
to
explore
the
city
's
locations
-
Fresh
stop
is
a
must
go
to
cafe
in
the
city
centre
.
For
a
restaurant
,
where
you
can
have
Sauteed
Reinderrs
,
restaurant
Kuu
which
is
in
the
city
centre
.
The
souvenir
shop
is
called
Finnska
souvenirs
and
that
in
the
town
as
well
.
Also
,
the
Helskini
city
museum
is
a
must
to
learn
about
the
city
's
heritage
and
history
.
Next
,
there
are
several
popular
places
to
listen
to
live
music
.
One
being
Musikkitalo
and
another
being
the
Apollo
live
club
.
FYI
,
Most
locations
are
either
closest
to
the
hotel
or
the
best
ones
available
that
meet
your
personal
preference
.
ht
be
cos
if
you
have
immunity
issues
you
’re
more
likely
to
suffer
the
negative
effects
of
running
in
the
fog
Fair
enough
.
U
been
doing
okay
?
Good
to
hear
If
u
say
it
is
😂
Btw
need
ur
help
with
something
I
got
Fawna
a
little
pressie
I
think
she
’ll
like
.
If
not
it
’ll
at
least
make
her
laugh
.
And
I
need
a
courier
getting
it
to
her
since
she
’s
ill
Okay
chill
out
😂
😂
I
have
been
saying
all
time
you
do
n’t
know
English
😂
Yh
postman
pat
does
n’t
work
Saturdays
so
the
polish
postmans
gon
na
have
to
help
Shhh

Thanks

you
then

Hi

to

for
being

The
earliest

Monday
and
i
've
booked
the
slot
.
In
the
meanwhile
should
I
prepare
the
emails
and
messages
or
is
not
that
something
I
do
n't
have
tro
worry
about
yet
Hi

Hope

Thanks
for
getting
back

I
just
thought
I
’d
let

I
do
have
a
meeting
with
my
placement
supervisor
Wednesday
at
12
and
a
dentist

.
I
’m
just
letting
you
know
in
case
that
affects
the
shadowing
.
I
’ll
hold
tight
.
Just
thought
I
’d

Hey

Hey

much

I
just
wanted
to
ask

I
’m
at
the
end
of
my

what
was
your
experience
like
with
your
final
with

doing

Hi

,
I
thought
I
'd
let
you
know
that
I
'm
presenting
my
topic
related
study
in
poster
form
tomorrow
.
If
you
're
not
busy
it
would
be
good
if
you
could
come
.
And
like
Gladis
said
I
'm
sure
you
'd
have
some
helpful
and
constructive
comments
.

Definitely
agree

found
it

Hi
Demetris
,
I
just
felt
like
I
had
to
apologise
for
the
tech
issues
and
other
difficulties
when
it
came
to
presenting
.
I
imagined
the
presentation
going
a
lot
smoother
than
it
felt
like
it
did
.
But
at
least
it
was
memorable
😆

Hi
Elmira
,
Good
to
hear
that
you
're
back
up
and
running
!
!
I
'm
not
going
to
be
helping
Stan
for
the
next
month
as
she
has
a
few
other
RA
's
so
she
mentioned
that
she
would
have
to
rotate
using
us
.
Honestly
,
I
would
love
to
shadow
tomorrow
but
I
have
final
year
orientation
day
tomorrow
so
I
wo
n't
be
able
to
come
tomorrow
.
However
,
from
next
week
onwards
,
I
am
free
and
willing
.
And
I
wo
n't
tell
you
to
go
away
,
after
all
what
are
cousins
for
😁
Thanks
for
the
email

See
you
then

Hi
Ritch
,
I
noticed
your
email
and
was
interested
but
was
a
bit
hesitant
to
reply
since
I
am
in
my
placement
year
,
not
my
final
year
.
I
'm
just
curious
whether
that
will
prevent
me
from
taking
part
in
your
study
.
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
!

Hi
Enrico
,
I
just
thought
I
'd
pass
on
my
feedback
and
if
I
get
any
more
,
I
'll
let
you
know
.
In
the
event
session
Sibylla
mentioned
we
had
a
lower
number
than
previously
experienced
.
It
might
just
have
been
down
to
the
earlyish
start
,
the
fact
that
it
's
recorded
or
that
students
have
unusual
sleeping
patterns
but
the
ones
who
did
attend
,
myself
included
,
found
it
helpful
,
reassuring
and
got
a
lot
out
of
it
.
Most
if
not
,
all
were
uncertain
about
things
relating
to
their
final
years
,
posters
,
final
year
modules
and
I
know
for
sure
the
chat
with
their
placement
tutor
helped
tremendously
.
I
'm
also
encouraging
students
if
they
know
anyone
in
their
tutor
group
who
did
n't
attend
to
fill
them
in
with
the
information
discussed
with
their
placement
tutor
.
Additionally
,
I
know
students
had
mixed
feelings
about
the
virtual
poster
session
and
having
to
use
a
completely
different
format
.
Alongside
,
tech
issues
that
some
students
were
having
mixed
with
a
new
platform
some
students
felt
whether
they
would
have
been
better
done
on
system
perhaps
in
the
form
of
breakout
groups
.
However
,
others
did
manage
it
fine
and
they
got
some
valuable
information
about
their
posters
and
potential
final
year
projects
.
Finally
,
even
though
the
social
event
was
n't
attended
by
very
many
students
,
it
was
definitely
a
fun
place
to
interact
with
other
placement
students
and
fellows
who
are
going
through
similar
experiences
and
be
able
to
share
our
ideas
in
a
collaborative
manner
.

Hi
Merilyn
,
Yeah
it
definitely
took
some
getting
used
to
initially
but
nicely
adjusted
into
it
by
now
.
Just
a
shame
it
’s
gone
a
bit
downhill
now
Ok
does
n’t
sound
the
most
positive
but
I
’m
glad
you
’ve
managed
to
get
through
it
alright
.
Just
take
care
of
yourself
and
enjoy
the
Easter
break
.
Best

I
was
going
to
answer
that
in
reply
to
the
long
email
you
sent
me
but
it
is
convenient
that
you
’ve
asked
.
So
back
in
Y11
as
part
of
work
experience
I
spent
a
week
at
school
in
Pheonix
as
job_title
and
that
involved
being
with
kids
ranging
from
Y7
-
11
.
In
my
secondary
I
was
a
student
mentor
for
kids
in
the
lower
years
.
And
I
’ve
done
some
support
work
for
local
Church
organising
events
and
our
yearly
community
day
event
.
So
,
that
did
involve
constantly
being
around
children
and
families
.
Hope
that
helps
,
.
Yeah
it
is
.
It
’s
when
I
had
my
organisation
induction
I
had
to
get
a
DBS
done
.
Is
that
the
same
thing
as
having
one
done
for
the
organisation
or
am
I
just
being
a
bit
blonde
here
.
Thanks

Hi
Silvano
,
I
have
a
copy
of
my
CV
and
a

I
’m
out
currently
but
when
I
get
back
home
I
will
send

Hi
Marje
,
Sorry
for
emailing
you
at
such
an
unusual
time
.
I
had
a
hectic
day
and
was
called
into
work
,
hence
the

with

o
would
like
a
little
heads
up
before
u
call
pls
K
but
ur
more
likely
to
get
an
answer
if
I
get
a
head
up
😂
Yus
and
I
’m
back
home
now
Give
me
a
few
let
me
just
put
on
my
headphones
I
’ll
tell
u
when
I
’m
ready
K
I
’m
ready
Kinda
depends
on
how
many
lessons
u
take
but
even
then
it
’s
not
really
realistic
I
think
anywhere
from
40
-
60
hrs
people
say
and
tht
includes
learning
how
to
drive
as
well
as
practicing
but
people
learn
at
different
rates
.
Some
might
pass
it
earlier
some
pass
later
.
It
’s
just
one
of
those
things
Hyatt

I
did
send
you

Agree
.
I
'll
also
try
to
implement
it
more
going
forward
Best
,
.
It
's
funny
because
when
I
first
joined
the
group
naturally
due
to
all
the
work
Samara
does
on
topic
I
just
assumed
she
was
really
empathic
.
I
'm
not
saying
she
is
n't
,
but
I
just
find
it
funny
and
ironic
how
she
spells
my
name
wrong
half
the
time
.
Thanks
😁
Best
,
.
Thank
you
!
By
the
way
funnily
enough
you
were
the
one
of
the
only
ones
in
the
group
to
apologise
for
having
spelt
my
name
correctly
🙌
.
So
,
I
just
had
a
little
chuckle
thinking
about
whilst
being
reflective
and
reminiscing
about
my
placement
Ps
.
I
thought
you
’d
be
pleased
to
hear
I
’ve
invested
in
a
pair
of
wireless
headphones
and
honestly
do
n’t
know
why
i
did
n’t
get
them
before
.
Morning
guys
,
I
just
wanted
to
thank
you
guys
for
bearing
with
me
on
my
undoubtably
confusing
poster
presentation
yesterday
😅
.
I
guess
I
got
so
excited
thinking
about
the
research
and
theoretical
side
that
I
neglected
simpler
aspects
of
the
poster
.
So
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
appreciate
all
the
feedback
.
It
was
really
helpful
so
thank
you
!
And
hopefully
I
’ll
see
you
guys
soon
😊

Hi

I
hope
you
enjoyed
your

you
would
be
good
for

Christabella
,
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
I
do
n’t
be
able
to
attend
tomorrow
’s
meeting
since
there
is
a
organisation
meeting
at
the

as
our

Hi
Faina
,
Thanks
for
the
email
.
It
’s
good
to
hear
from
you
,
I
appreciate
the
update
and
will
be
sure
to
contact
you
if
needed
.
I
think
there
was
just
a
lack
of
clarity
amongst
my
cohort
with
tutors
and
placement
tutors
.
It
’s
why
I
brought
up
the
query
but
it
’s
good
to
know
that
you
and
other
personal
tutors
are
still
available
to
support
the
students
.
Thanks
again
for
the
email
!
Kind

Hi
Ollie
,
I
’ve
booked
the
meeting
for
Sunday
at
4:00
.
I
think
I
’ll
need
to
book
a
second
slot
since
it
’s
likely
that
the
meeting
will
run
over
15
mins
so
I
’ll
do
that
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
Like
I
mentioned
on
last
Tuesday
.
It
’ll
just
be
me
asking
you
some
questions
regarding
topic
and
updating
you
on
the
research
I
’m
doing
.
Best

Hi
Kandy
,
Just
wanted
to
say
congratulations
when
I
’m
not
being
put
on
the
spot
by
Hamel
and
apologies
for
not
having
said
it
earlier
😅
By
the
way
I
thought
you
looked
familiar
when
I
started
the
placement
.
Then
I
found
this
.
Memory
ca
n’t
be
all
bad
then
🤓
.
Congratulation
again
and
enjoy
celebrating
you
deserve
it
!
Ps
.
Hope
you
get
to
have
a
proper
celebration
once
lockdowns
over
😊
.
Yeah
i
guess
I
’m
still
getting
used
to
that
about
Anna
.
I
remember
yours
and
Karita
’s
experiments
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
were
the
two
longest
ones
I
participated
in
.
Anyway
see
you
in
tomorrow
’s
meeting
😊

Hi
Sarajane
,
So
just
for
some
clarification
you
want
me
to
present
a
study
I
find
interesting
and
a
recent
one
at
the
29644233
and
I
ca
n’t
find
one
from
those
years
just
the
next
most
recent
one
.
Also
,
to
my
understanding
you
like
me
to
find
one
that
has
elements
of
topic
,
topic
and

.

Odetta

I
hope
your
well
I

Well
I

Paolina
,
I
understand
that
and
the
only
reason
I
was
n’t
able
to
work
my
schedule
around
yesterday
’s
meeting
was
that
it
was
a
different
job
.
Going
forward
I
will
ensure
that
I
sort
out
my
work
time
so
that
I
can
attend
the
Saturday
meetings
.
My
apologies
for
letting
you
down
,
it
was
never
my
intention
.

I
’ll

in

Hi
Jesselyn
,
I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
the
reason
why
I
did
n’t
attend
yesterday
’s
meeting
is
that
I
’ve
changed
jobs
and
I
’m
working
during
the
day
at
the
moment
.
Sorry
I
did
n’t
let
you
know
earlier
.
I
remember
you
mentioning
that
come
July
you
’ll
have
time
and
that
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
have
one
to
one
meetings
.
I
’m
just
making
you
aware
that
it
might
be
even
more
of
a
good
idea
since
I
’m
not
sure
whether
I
’ll
be
able
to
attend
the
Saturday
meetings
.

Hi

you

Hi
Roice

My

is
n’t
till
the

of
August

And
thinking
about
I
would
rather
present
my

It
’ll
give
me
a
chance
to
do
a
professional
run
through
with

Also
,
I
was
going
to
email
you
in

to
this

I
was
gon

ask

Hi

I

and
we
’re
in
location
in
the

We
were
just
wondering
how
the
two
way
mirror
works
since
you
can
see
quite
unambiguously
see
the
outside
from
inside
the
room
.
So
we
’re
wondering
if
that
’s
how
it
’s
supposed
to
be
or
if
we
’re
doing
something
wrong
.

Hi
Carlton
,
I
do
n’t
know
if
you
remember
me
and
and
its
fine
if
you
do
n’t
I
get
that
you
’re
in
constant
communication
with
loads
of
students
.
I
remember
that
you
were
one
of
if
not
the
most
helpful
,
supportive
,
kind
and
encouraging
lecturer
that
I
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
come
across
whilst
I
was
in
my
second
year
.
Even
when
I
felt
stupid
because
I
forgot
something
as
simple
as
effect
size
you
reassured
me
and
made
me
feel
comfortable
.
Without
judgement
or
criticism
you
were
there
to
help
.
From
extending
the
session
time
when
my
internet
had
switched
off
to
helping
me
one
on
one
.
You
went
above
and
beyond
to
help
me
finish
my
topic
report
and
you
always
did
it
with
a
smile
.
In
case
you
’re
wondering
why
I
’m
sending
you
this
email
what
seems
to
be
and
probably
is
random
email
.
I
’m
Douglass
's
RA
and
she
told
me
that
you
and
her
are
besties
and
we
got
talking
about
how
cool
you
are
.
So
I
just
really
wanted
to
let
you
know
how
much
I
appreciate
you
and
how
amazing
you
are
😊
And
just
so
you
know
the
world
would
be
much
better
off
if
it
had
a
few
more
people
like
you
in
it
.

Congrats
on

Hi
Klara
,
Just
a
quick
question
about
the
topic
.
You
know
how
’s
there
’s
the
top
down
effect
on
the
topic
so
there
’s
more
connectivity
going
down
than
up
In
terms
of
its
significance
relating
to
function
.
Is
that
about
conveying
expectations
about
stimuli
and
helping
with
the
selection
of
stimuli
Or
is
it
something
else
Thanks
,
.
Okay
thanks
Eadie

I
did
n’t
expect
such
a
quick
reply
but
that
’s
a
nice
surprise

Hi
Amabel
,
Thanks
for
getting
back
to
me
with
both
the
short
and
long
answer
.
It
’s
very
helpful
and
fascinating
too
🤓
With
all
the
research
I
’m
doing
at
the
moment
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
have
a
meeting
next
week
so
we
can
have
a
chat
about
these
concepts
.
Plus
it
’ll
be
useful
since
I
’m
reading
quite
a
few

as
well
to
further
consolidate
my
own
knowledge

,
but
with
COVID
and
my
instructor
getting
fully
booked
quickly
I
need
to
take
whatever
lesson
offered
,
as
I
had
to
delay
my
test
due
to
COVID
.

Hi
Knox
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Thank
you
giving
me
feedback
on
my
practice
assessment
.
I
’ve
just
noticed
that
the
recording
of
my
practice
assessment
is
available
to
re
-
watch
on
systemsystem
.
Unfortunately
I
am
uncomfortable
with
this
,
as
I
am
concerned
this
will
lead
to
other
students
watching
my
recording
and
use
my
responses
in
their
work
to
plagiarise
,
which
could
penalise
me
unnecessarily
,
as
I
have
not
plagiarised
especially
if
my
real
assessment
will
be
in
July
compared
to
someone
who
would
deliberately
have
their
assessment
in
July
to
avoid
being
suspected
of
plagiarising
my
work
.
Therefore
,
is
there
any
way
you
could
password
protect
our
videos
to
ensure
only
the
moderator
,
yourself
and
the
named
student
can
access
the
recording
of
the
video
instead
please
?
I
think
contacting
I.T
to
arrange
this
may
be
helpful
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
It
’s
okay
.
I
’ll
email
you
my
query
now
and
if
I
’m
happy
with
the
response
then
I
’ll
leave
the
system
appointment
for
Saturday
.
So
with
regards
to
the
presentation
assignment
,
I
wanted
to
know
if
my
arguments
for
Question
1
were
appropriate
.
I
will
be
concluding
that
judicial
dialogue
has
increased
in
EU
law
,
meaning
constitutional
pluralism
has
not
died
out
as
the
Q
suggests
.
My
arguments
to
reach
the
conclusion
are
as
follows
:
copied_text
Of
course
I
will
include
a
number
of
journal
articles
from
further
reading
,
but
are
these
arguments
appropriate
to
tackle
the
question
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
I
literally
would
!
!
🤣
🤣
I
woke
up
to
my
heart
beating
really
fast
and
I
was
excited
😂
Keenan
got
fed
up
of
translating
everything
to
Ruby

she
was
in
a
rush
to
go
somewhere
but
idk
where

It
’s
sooo
weird
because
the
other
day
I
asked
Valerie
to
be
my
personal
photographer
😂
😂
And
the
dream
was
so
accurate
Keep
note
of
his
appearance
in
case
you
bump
into
him
😂
Yh
I
really
wish
it
was
true
.
I
wore
my
favourite
outfit
as
well
😂
😭
Yh
me
neither
but
if
ever
you
do
just
keep
an
eye
out
😂
Philip
,
How
are
you
?
I
hope
you
and
your
family
are
coping
well
.
I
am
emailing
you
to
inform
you
that
I
have
secured
a
job
with
the
organisation
as
their
job_title
for
the
probate
department
.
I
had
my
interview
2
weeks
ago
and
now
I
’m
waiting
for
the
pre
-
employment
checks
to
be
completed
.
My
start
date
will
be
in
December
,
which
gives
me
plenty
of
time
to
finish
off
my
university
studies
without
the
stress
of
working
alongside
this
.
I
also
wanted
to
say
thank
you
for
being
a
wonderful
personal
tutor
.
Your
help
,
support
and
advice
on
how
to
do
well
in
an
interview
really
helped
me
gain
confidence
to
do
well
in
this
interview
.
It
took
me
one
year
to
get
into
the
organisation
as
their
recruitment
process
is
tough
but
you
’re
advice
really
helped
and
reassured
me
.

Hi
Fran
,
Thank
your
email
.
Just
one
last
question
,
is
the
ruling
of
Re
Thompson
good
caselaw
to
use
in
saying
that
the
Testator
’s
residuary
legatee
can
act
as
an
enforcer
of
a
trust
if
the
beneficiaries
are
unclear
?

Ironically
at

,
whereby
I
told
you
I
was
unsuccessful
with
all
the
jobs
I
applied
to
,
one
hour
after
our
meeting
I
received
an
email
from
organisation
asking
me
to
choose
an
interview
slot
with

I

weeks

waiting

Dear
Blare
,
Thank
you
for
your

Your
explanation
was
very
helpful
.
Just
another
question
,
will
our
summer
exam
topics
be
based
on
both
TP1
and
TP2
content
?
Kind

Hi
Hesther
,
Please
find
below
my
amended
Delivering
at
pace
competency
as
discussed
in
our
meeting
.
Please
can
you
check
it
over
and
tell
me
if
its
a
strong
example
to
use
,
as
I
do
n’t
have
any
other
examples
other
than
this
.
Delivering
at
Pace
:
Vice
President
>
Alongside
university
assignment
deadlines
and
part
time
work
.
Organised
our
first
event
.
Social
promotions
and
catering
side
was
organised
by
our
university
however
we
did
n’t
have
a
venue
finalised
>
Treasurer
missed
the
deadline
to
pay
the
deposit
,
acted
upon
incorrect
advice
.
Problematic
as
I
stressed
for
weeks
the
importance
of
us
having
the
venue
finalised
by
Mid
July
as
it
is
cheaper
and
would
allow
us
more
time
to
focus
on
finishing
off
our
university
assignments
and
managing
part
time
work
.
Second
Issue
>
Committee
did
n’t
get
along
due
to
differing
opinions
Resolution
>
As
I
knew
the
rules
were
correct
,
I
had
to
liaise
with
organisation
officer
and
inform
her
of
the
situation
,
she
kindly
realised
the
payment
to
venue
and
secured
the
booking
.
Then
Held
an
urgent
meeting
with
supervisor
present
,
ensured
my
knowledge
of
the
rules
were
correct
and
ensured
no
bitterness
in
meeting
>
I
briefed
committee
on
organisation
rules
and
correct
method
for
paying
external
companies
.
Stressed
that
this
time
I
quickly
resolved
the
situation
but
next
time
this
should
not
happen
again
.
Still
bitterness
between
committee
members
so
I
held
another
urgent
meeting
with
myself
,
president
and
supervisor
an
raised
my
concerns
.
I
decided
it
was
best
I
have
a
1
-
2
-
1
meeting
with
each
member
discussing
their
concerns
and
feelings
.
Outcome
>
Good
>
understood
the
reason
behind
concerns
>
difficult
for
everyone
to
adjust
in
such
a
fast
paced
environment
to
organise
large
scale
events
due
to
university
and
work
commitments
.
>
I
stressed
importance
of
following
rules
and
asking
for
help
when
in
doubt
.
Able
to
secure
venue
in
time
as
anticipated
but
it
meant
that
we
had
to
pay
more
money
for
this
as
we
previously
missed
the
deposit
and
arranged
this
one
day
before
event
day
advertised
for
.
However
we
compensated
for
this
because
lots
of
students
signed
up
to
go
,
became
overbooked
and
students
were
happy
to
pay
us
an
entry
fee
Going
forward
,
committee
co
-
organised
a
series
of
successful
events
in
a
timely
manner
and
less
confusion
occurred
.

Dear

I
hope
you
’re
well

I
’m
in
a
sticky
situation
regarding
the
submission
of
my
module
Summative
.
I
have
written
confirmation
from
one
of
my
module
module
tutors
I
’m
worried
that
if
I
do
this
and
I
’m
later
told
a
bibliography
was
required
my
grade
will
be
lowered
.
I
was
n’t
sure
what
to
do
,
hence
why
I
emailed
you
as
I
thought
as
the
programme
director
you
may
have
a
solution
.

Hi
Amity
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Thank
you
so
much
for
emailing
me
my
grade
and
feedback
!
I
’m
over
the
moon
that
I
’ve
achieved
a
First
,
I
’m
very
happy
!
I
just
wanted
to
say
a
big
Thank
you
to
you
.
I
have
really
,
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
module
and
I
always
looked
forward
to
our
webinars
and
lecture
as
I
found
this
module
to
be
very
informative
,
interesting
and
intellectually
stimulating
.
I
loved
the
way
you
taught
us
topic
as
you
were
very
knowledgeable
and
having
your
stories
based
on
your
life
in
Iran
incorporated
in
your
teaching
,
really
helped
me
understand
the
module
on
a
more
deeper
level
.
Thank
you
for
all
your
help
and
support
throughout
the
module
module
,
I
really
appreciate
it
and
can
not
thank
you
enough
.
You
was
an
amazing
tutor
!
😊
At
least
now
having
listened
to
my
oral
assessment
answers
,
you
know
you
can
always
return
used
goods
to
QVC
providing
you
are
within
your
30
day
money
back
guarantee
period

Dear
Cam
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
Yes
,
I
did
initially
write
‘
presumption
of
contract
,
’
as
the
trust
funds
were
given
for
a
specific
reason
.
However
,
having
done
some
research
,
I
felt
more
confident
in
concluding
it
was
a
conditional
gift
and
the
assistance
part
remained
an
excuse
and
I
gave
good
reasons
to
justify
my
view
.
Yes
,
I
have
decided
to
do
the
problem
question
,
as
my
strengths
lie
in
this
.
I
will
contact
Cass
shortly
regarding
my
question
.
However
,
I
just
wanted
to
clarify
,
can
resulting
trusts
in
the
forms
of
gifts
or
presumptions
still
be
held
valid
even
if
the
settlor
created
the
trust
in
their
will
?
For
example
,
If
I
wrote
in
my
will
that
I
wanted
my
neighbour
to
have
£
3k
to
assist
them
with
garden
renovations
,
will
this
trust
be
valid
even
though
it
will
take
effect
after
my
death
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Janine
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
and
yes
I
received
my
module
Proposal
last
night
.
I
’m
very
happy
with
my
feedback
,
as
you
picked
up
on
my
concerns
as
I
began
to
have
second
thoughts
on
my
question
.
I
have
booked
a
system
Appointment
with
yourself
for
tomorrow
morning
and
look
forward
to
discuss
this
further
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Jeff
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
am
emailing
you
to
inform
you
,
that
having
spent
a
couple
of
hours
on
researching
and
finding
ways
to
narrow
my
research
question
;
I
have
decided
that
doing
my
research
based
on
Silk
Road
is
n’t
the
best
option
for
me
as
there
is
n’t
much
legislation
or
frameworks
to
go
by
and
this
was
the
case
even
after
I
read
the
case
transcript
earlier
today
.
I
have
therefore
decided
to
go
with
the
second
question
I
proposed
to
you
through
email
back
in
November
regarding
the
event
.
My
question
would
be
:
‘
‘
assignment_title
I
think
this
a
very
focused
question
as
I
have
limited
it
to
corruption
in
sport
only
and
no
other
sport
.
Also
I
have
found
a
number
of
relevant
legislation
,
codes
and
frameworks
to
analyse
and
include
in
my
research
and
will
be
able
to
conclude
this
sort
of
corruption
is
based
on
culture
.
For
example
,
most
of
the
job_titles
who
have
been
convicted
and
banned
for
match
-
fixing
are
small
,
mainly
country_adj
.
Iraq
have
no
job_titles
and
I
have
argued
this
is
because
the
Fraud
Act
2006
,
Bribery
Act
2010
and
Money
Laundering
regulations
deters
them
from
doing
so
as
UK
legal
system
is
stricter
compared
to
large
etc
.
I
will
of
course
discuss
this
in
more
detail
in
our
meeting
tomorrow
as
this
is
of
course
a
drastic
,
sudden
change
but
mentally
I
feel
happier
and
better
pursing
this
proposal
.
Hence
why
I
thought
to
give
you
the
heads
up
.
Apologies
for
my
lengthy
email
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
s
where
you
bring
a
dish
to
your
lunch
It
’s
our
social
event
I
was
thinking
chole
bature
or
chilli
paneer
Theme
is
international
so
I
’m
literally
out
my
wits
here
trying
to
bake
cakes
and
it
’s
going
wrong
My
cake
exploded
in
the
oven
today
but
idk
what
I
did
wrong!
😭
🤷
🏻‍

️
I
followed
a
recipe
which
makes
it
worse
😂
😂
Yh
my
moms
kitchen
aid
is
on
wait
list
The
most
glamorous
thing
I
’ve
done
is
make
main
courses
appetisers
starters
and
paint
the
house
and
doors
😂
😭
Basically
me
,
you
and
Elbertine
just
sat
down
at
our
table
in
restaurant
but
suddenly
Wyatan
called
me
saying
her
and
Matteo
could
see
me
as
their
table
was
on
the
left
hand
side
.
I
got
up
to
say
hello
but
on
the
right
hand
side
,
Garry
Sandhu
❤
️
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
some
guys
.
I
looked
at
him
said
OMG
then
walked
straight
over
to
him
then
you
and
Laural
realised
it
was
Garry
so
Oona
went
running
with
her
phone
to
film
all
this
while
Reinhold
was
saying
‘
why
is
.
walking
over
to
a
random
40
year
old
’
then
you
shouted
‘
.
’s
man
’s
here
’
.
😂
Garry
took
a
selfie
with
me
and
gave
me
a
hug
then
asked
me
to
sing
a
song
so
I
sang
the
first
part
of
one
song
then
he
asked
to
sing
one
of
his
songs
so
I
sang
the
last
part
of
his
song
then
Garry
joined
in
and
then
after
he
asked
me
what
song
I
wanted
him
to
sing
so
I
gave
him
2
songs
plus
a
surprise
one
and
he
sang
them
!
They
were
really
upbeat
.
You
was
loving
it
and
said
’
this
is
like
daylight
clubbing
’
😂
And
Max
said
‘
I
should
listen
to
this
in
lockdown
,
no
need
to
understand
it
when
the
beat
is
motivating
’
😂
God
knows
where
Garry
got
the
microphone
and
speakers
from
though
😂
and
the
surprise
song
he
sang
was
a
romantic
song
🥰
and
we
both
danced
to
it
and
you
were
saying
‘
for
someone
who
plans
things
months
in
advance
.
’s
definitely
a
good
spontaneous
dancer
’
then
Garry
asked
me
how
old
I
was
and
he
said
it
was
a
Shame
I
was
6604
then
asked
would
I
ever
consider
him
and
I
said
no
because
of
his
age
then
he
said
it
’s
okay
then
said
I
’m
really
cute
and
sweet
and
should
always
be
happy
because
I
have
a
nice
smile
and
then
we
both
exchanged
numbers
.
I
went
to
Say
hello
to
Aina
and
Christopher
but
Garry
followed
me
and
said
he
’s
going
now
and
gave
me
a
really
big
and
long
hug
and
said
if
he
does
n’t
see
me
again
then
to
be
happy
because
I
’m
sweet
and
i
said
you
too
and
then
he
walked
off
and
because
I
was
so
happy
I
ended
up
buying
mocktails
for
Jeniece
and
Rodger
’s
table
but
idek
who
the
other
ppl
at
their
table
were
😂
😂
Having
conducted
my
research
for
my
CEO
's
stay
at
Helsinki
I
have
shortlisted
a
number
of
places
which
accommodates
her
budget
.
Firstly
,
I
shortlisted
Hotel
:
Marksi
By
Scandic
which
is
based
in
the
Helsinki
city
centre
.
I
have
selected
the
Classic
Double
room
package
which
costs
£
157
per
night
.
This
package
includes
free
breakfast
which
will
be
delivered
to
my
CEO
at
her
room
,
which
means
she
need
not
travel
out
to
a
café
.
This
package
also
contains
a
free
re
-
booking
policy
which
is
very
good
in
case
she
needs
to
change
her
booking
due
to
COVID
and
can
do
so
without
worrying
about
paying
extra
money
.
Secondly
,
in
case
my
CEO
wanted
to
travel
to
a
café
to
eat
breakfast
,
I
have
selected
the
Fazer
Café
Kluuvikatu
3
,
café
which
is
also
based
in
the
city
centre
and
offers
breakfast
.
It
is
rated
4
-
5
stars
which
is
a
good
option
.
A
restaurant
i
shortlisted
was
:
Rosemariini
,
this
includes
vegetarian
and
non
-
vegetarian
dishes
which
is
good
for
diversity
of
food
and
options
.
It
offers
different
payment
methods
but
currently
offers
a
take
away
service
.
the
Second
restaurant
i
chose
which
is
better
than
the
first
option
is
:
Lappi
Ravintola
.
this
is
a
traditional
restaurant
with
4
-
5
star
ratings
and
offers
a
4
course
meal
,
table
booking
and
different
payment
methods
i
strongly
recommend
my
CEO
to
visit
this
restaurant
.
Thirdly
,
the
souvenir
shop
i
have
chosen
for
my
CEO
to
visit
is
called
:
Moomin
Shop
Forum
.
This
is
based
in
the
city
centre
and
has
received
4
-
5
star
ratings
from
TripAdvisor
.
This
gift
shop
contains
gifts
such
as
books
,
toys
,
cups
and
clothes
which
is
highly
ideal
and
beneficial
for
my
CEO
to
buy
gifts
for
herself
and
children
as
they
may
like
books
and
toys
.
This
gift
shop
is
also
based
in
international
Helsinki
airport
as
well
as
all
over
Helsinki
so
is
easily
accessible
to
visit
.
Finally
,
I
have
selected
Helsinki
City
Museum
to
visit
,
as
this
is
based
in
the
city
centre
,
not
too
far
from
the
hotel
.
This
also
includes
online
exhibitions
which
is
beneficial
in
case
COVID
was
to
increase
in
September
and
my
CEO
would
be
left
with
nothing
to
do
,
if
this
did
happen
then
my
CEO
could
attend
online
exhibitions
too
.
Furthermore
,
i
found
a
live
music
bar
for
my
CEO
to
visit
,
called
Storyville
,
Helsinki
.
this
offers
food
,
alongside
live
music
band
,
piano
room
and
dance
floor
which
seems
very
entertaining
.
Dear
Sheryl
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
For
my
assignment
which
is
about
assignment_title
,
I
have
created
a
small
a
questionnaire
to
see
how
people
who
have
little
,
no
or
full
interest
in
sport
are
able
to
spot
event
occurring
and
why
they
think
it
is
more
common
in
amazing
Countries
than
in
America
.
The
participants
I
have
chosen
are
my
friends
.
They
have
different
opinions
based
on
their
knowledge
which
is
useful
for
my
assignment
.
I
have
written
evidence
of
the
participants
being
happy
to
participate
in
my
Questionnaire
which
will
ensure
the
responses
are
kept
anonymous
With
regards
to
the
strengths
based
questions
,
they
asked
me
one
yesno
question
which
was
about
how
resilience
in
a
new
situation
.
The
other
2
were
linked
to
problem
solving
and
delivering
advice
to
customers
in
terms
of
how
I
would
feel
doing
this
and
how
I
would
act
in
a
problematic
situation
.
I
was
n’t
asked
to
do
a
practice
call
either
.
I
am
hoping
for
the
best
,
but
time
will
tell
.
I
will
know
the
outcome
by
the
end
of
December
.

Hi
Fidelia
,
Thank
you
for
confirming
this
.
I
also
wanted
to
ask
,
I
want
to
apply
for
university
’s
Postgraduate
course
:
course
for
8058
,
however
I
’m
unable
to
create
an
application
.
I
have
created
a
new
account
to
apply
but
when
I
log
in
it
says
I
have
entered
the
incorrect
login
details
even
though
I
have
n’t
.
I
’m
unsure
what
to
do
regarding
this
.
Kind

Hi
Karie
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Have
you
received
an
email
from
organisation
,
regarding
my
reference
?
Kind

,
..
Hi
Cher
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
After
thinking
long
and
hard
over
the
past
few
weeks
,
I
have
decided
to
withdraw
my
interview
for
the
job_title
role
.
I
will
therefore
cancel
our
scheduled
meeting
for
Tuesday
morning
.
I
am
completely
honoured
that
I
was
selected
for
an
interview
despite
only
having
university
based
experiences
,
however
I
feel
that
personally
I
’m
not
ready
to
take
on
such
a
massive
responsibility
at
my
age
.
I
want
to
really
understand
how
organisation
works
and
then
branch
out
and
work
my
way
up
thereafter
.
Having
reviewed
my
application
,
I
can
see
why
my
application
was
successful
,
I.E.
my
references
to
the
job
description
and
displaying
of
my
personality
was
unique
.
I
will
therefore
use
this
as
a
guide
and
motivation
in
a
year
or
2
time
to
apply
for
higher
band
posts
but
for
now
I
feel
comfortable
starting
off
at
a
lower
band
and
working
my
way
up
as
this
is
my
first
ever
job
that
too
with
organisation
so
I
do
n’t
want
to
be
under
a
lot
of
stress
,
pressure
and
do
n’t
want
to
make
a
lot
of
mistakes
.
Apologies
for
any
inconveniences
I
may
have
caused
.
Kind
Regards
,
..

Hi

Thank
you

’ve
had
so
much

Yes

I
would
definitely
like
to
stay
in
touch
with
you
.
😊
My
start
date
for
work
is
9374
July
,
so
I
will
need
an
ego
boost
from
you
,
as
I
’m
already
feeling
really
nervous
about
starting
work
.
In
OctoberAugust
time
,
do
you
plan
on
working
on
campus
?
If
so
please
can
you
let
me
know
,
as
I
would
like
to
see
you
and
thank
you
personally
!
😊

With

to
organisation

Please
do
let
me
know

Dear
Stephi
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
have
had
a
look
at
the
university
website
and
it
says
that
online
graduation
for
final
years
will
take
place
on
7557
June
,
only
if
debts
to
the
university
are
paid
by
5641
December
and
if
exams
are
completed
.
Does
this
apply
to
the
4195
final
year
cohort
?
If
so
,
would
n’t
this
be
impossible
,
because
the
last
date
in
which
the
tuition
fees
will
be
paid
to
the
university
is
4586
October
.
Also
the
final
year
exams
begin
on
August
3192
.
Hence
,
in
light
of
this
,
will
there
be
another
online
graduation
for
final
years
in
September
?
I
ask
this
,
as
I
would
need
to
request
annual
leave
from
work
at
the
earliest
opportunity
.

Regards

May

you

Hi
Ainslie
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
have
secured
an
interview
with
the
organisation
!
I
’m
so
happy
about
it
!
Please
can
you
book
me
in
for
a
mock
interview
with
yourself
?
My
interview
is
on
September
1168
,
but
I
do
plan
to
have
2
mock
interviews
with
yourself
if
that
’s
available
.

Hi
Agna
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
As
requested
,
please
find
attached
in
this
email
my
CV
.
With
regards
to
my
covering
letter
,
I
do
n’t
have
one
generic
covering
letter
.
Instead
I
tailor
my
covering
letter
depending
on
if
the
employer
requires
it
,
and
recently
I
have
n’t
been
asked
to
produce
a
covering
letter
.
However
,
if
you
would
like
me
to
email
you
a
covering
letter
I
used
for
my
placement
application
,
then
I
am
happy
to
do
this
.
Finally
,
with
regards
to
a
‘
potential
’
graduation
ceremony
in
November
,
I
had
a
suggestion
.
If
the
pandemic
has
calmed
down
in
August
8077
like
it
did
in
July
886
,
I
was
thinking
would
the
university
consider
having
a
graduation
ceremony
on
campus
but
in
bubbles
,
as
in
with
groups
of
students
instead
?
The
groups
could
be
organised
by
surname
perhaps
with
everyone
being
allowed
to
bring
1
-
2
people
from
their
household
?

Al
,
Thank
you
for
letting
me
know

I
did
initially
think
this
would
be
the
case
.
Do
you
have
an
idea
as
to
when
we
’ll
receive
our
grades
as
I
am
quite
nervous

Hi
Jemmie
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
With
regards
to
our
grades
for
the
written
coursework
assignment
,
many
students
have
received
their
marks
on
system
but
I
have
n’t
yet
received
mine
.
Is
there
a
particular
reason
for
this
?
As
when
I
go
into
system
to
locate
my
grade
it
says
‘
needs
marking
’
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Hi
Milt
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
First
of
all
,
I
wanted
to
say
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
and
support
with
our
coursework
,
I
’ve
never
come
across
a
tutor
throughout
my
academic
life
who
has
been
so
supportive
and
helpful
!
Secondly
,
with
regards
to
the
coursework
,
in
the
client
options
section
,
I
have
stated
what
each
option
is
but
instead
of
writing
a
sentence
or
two
about
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
option
I
have
instead
bullet
pointed
them
.
So
for
example
I
have
done
the
following
:
copied_text
Is
this
okay
to
use
for
the
summative
as
I
am
having
difficulty
with
the
word
count
?
Or
do
you
want
me
to
write
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
option
as
a
sentence
like
you
did
in
your
model
answer
?

My

They

Hi
Rachelle
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
Firstly
,
I
really
want
to
say
thank
you
so
much
for
helping
me
with
my
course
application
for
organisation
.
I
have
an
interview
with
them
next
Thursday
!
Is
it
possible
for
me
to
have
a
mock
interview
with
you
as
part
of
my
preparation
,
as
I
’m
not
sure
how
to
prepare
as
such
?
I
did
try
to
book
a
virtual
appointment
with
you
but
I
was
unable
to
do
so
via
system
.
Thank
you
once
again
your
help
.
Kind

Hi
Pavel
,
No
need
to
apologise
!
I
hope
you
enjoyed
your
annual
leave
.
I
sent
my
application
off
on
Tuesday
morning
and
this
afternoon
they
asked
me
to
choose
an
interview
date
!
I
chose
4419
December
10.00am
as
my
interview
slot
so
I
’m
awaiting
confirmation
now
.
How
do
you
think
I
should
prepare
for
my
interview
?
My
interview
is
a
virtual
one
via
zoom
and
I
’m
having
a
mock
interview
with
Pammy
on
my
teams
some
time
next
week
.
Thank
you
so
much
with
your
help
and
support
with
my
application
.
I
manage
ls
to
get
in
touch
with
your
friend
Juliane
and
she
was
very
lovely
and
helpful
in
answering
any
questions
I
had
in
very
good
detail
!
I
really
needed
to
speak
to
Kellen
as
I
have
learnt
so
much
about
the
working
world
.
Kind
Regards

No
need
to
dip
out
of
your
training
on
Sunday
.
Thursday
10
am
is
perfect
for
me
.
Yes
,
I
will
be
reviewing
my
application
and
picking
out
good
examples
to
use
.
I
will
be
researching
more
into
the
company
values
so
that
I
can
incorporate
it
into
my
answers
.
I
would
describe
myself
in
3
words
as
:
hard
-
working
,
caring
and
understanding
.
I
’m
not
sure
why
it
is
that
this
question
is
asked
.
What
would
you
suggest
?
Also
they
do
n’t
have
social
media
as
they
are
a
high
street
national
law
firm
.
Kind

Hi
Othella
,
Thank
you
for
email
!
I
will
definitely
be
asking
them
a
question
about
the
pandemic
,
I
think
that
this
is
a
really
good
question
to
ask
.
Do
you
think
it
would
be
okay
for
me
to
ask
them
if
they
plan
to
specialise
In
other
areas
of
subject
such
as
topic
?
As
I
am
interested
in
this
and
I
could
link
this
with
my
virtual
internship
I
did
over
the
summer
?
Also
,
is
it
okay
for
me
to
ask
Thorny
,
what
made
her
want
to
pursue
a
career
in
subject
and
not
subject
,
which
was
what
her
first
degree
was
in
?
I
obtained
this
information
on
her
LinkedIn
profile
and
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
,
personal
question
to
ask

Hi
Casey

I
’m
glad

good
news
for
you

this
Monday
at
10
am
.
I
have
had
a
mock
interview
session
with
Sheilakathryn
and
am
currently
doing
my
preparation
for
my
interview
.
Is
there
anything
in
particular

like

of
if
there
is

Hi
Carlita
,
As
requested
these
are
my
questions
I
want
to
ask
Roxane
:
Will
there
be
an
opportunity
to
progress
further
after
I
have
completed
my
training
contract
,
as
in
will
I
be
offered
a
job
with
organisation
as
a
job_title
If
my
performance
as
a
trainee
is
good
?
The
above
question
needs
to
be
re
-
worded
I
think
but
i
’m
not
sure
how
to
re
-
word
it
.
Do
you
have
any
suggestions
?

What
did
you
find
challenging
during
your
time
in
organisation
and
how
did
you
overcome
it
?
–
what
do
you
think
I
will
find
challenging
?
copied_text
Having
read
your
LinkedIn
profile
,
I
was
amazed
at
how
you
graduated
with
a
degree
in
course
.
What
made
you
change
your
mind
and
pursue
a
career
in
subject
instead
?

When
can
I
look

from

Dear
Lavina
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
Yes
I
have
re
-
submitted
like
you
have
requested
me
to
.
However
,
my
word
count
on
system
still
includes
my
footnotes
and
cover
page
words
.
I
’m
not
sure
if
you
’re
aware
of
this
,
but
system
usually
includes
the
footnotes
and
cover
page
into
the
overall
word
count
and
hence
can
not
distinguish
between
the
two
.
Hence
I
have
always
been
advised
by
my
previous
module
tutors
since
First
Year
of
university
,
to
simply
declare
my
word
count
without
the
footnotes
etc
on
my
Cover
Page
.
Therefore
,
please
find
attached
in
this
email
a
screenshot
of
my
summative
.
It
confirms
that
excluding
my
cover
page
and
footnotes
,
my
word
count
for
my
assignment
answer
totals
1500
words
and
this
is
located
on
the
bottom
of
the
picture
.

Hi
Neron
,
I
’m
so
sorry
for
how
I
ended
our
last
appointment
,
I
booked
a
doctor
’s
appointment
this
morning
but
they
could
n’t
guarantee
a
time
they
would
call
me
but
it
’s
all
sorted
now
.
I
’ve
booked
another
follow
-
up
appointment
with
yourself
for
next
week
for
Friday
afternoon
.
As
we
discussed
,
between
now
and
our
next
meeting
I
will
re
-
work
my
competency
to
include
my
organisation
experience
and
will
look
to
match
my
experience
in
all
my
competencies
to
the
job_title
Job
description

Apologies
once
again
!
Kind

Dear
Zary
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
Yes
,
of
course
I
have
lots
of
lessons
to
share
which
I
will
outline
below
as
follows
:
Firstly
,
after
spending
one
year
trying
to
get
into
organisation
even
for
an
interview
,
I
learned
that
my
previous
applications
were
unsuccessful
,
as
I
was
n’t
using
STAR
technique
correctly
.
Hence
,
I
created
my
own
formula
called
IPROG
technique
.
I
=
introduction
of
the
role
I
was
in
,
P
=
problem
I
faced
,
R
=
resolving
steps
I
took
,
O
=
outcome
and
G
=
going
forward
the
things
I
have
learned
from
the
experience
and
how
I
will
apply
these
to
the
job
I
am
applying
for
.
After
adapting
my
IPROG
technique
I
was
becoming
successful
with
my
applications
and
this
was
how
I
passed
my
first
ever
interview
with
organisation
.
Secondly
,
I
feel
my
success
from
my
interview
stems
in
how
I
was
able
to
speak
confidently
and
also
display
my
personality
through
being
pleasant
and
building
an
initial
rapport
with
the
interviewing
panel
at
the
start
of
my
interview
and
at
the
end
when
I
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
them
questions
.
I
therefore
think
it
’s
a
really
good
thing
to
display
your
personality
because
often
employers
do
n’t
just
want
to
employ
a
person
who
looks
good
on
paper
with
high
grades
but
also
someone
who
is
friendly
,
easy
to
talk
to
as
this
reflects
the
ability
to
work
well
with
others
and
build
a
friendly
working
atmosphere
.
Thirdly
,
for
me
the
whole
process
of
constantly
applying
for
jobs
within
organisation
has
been
very
rewarding
.
Overtime
,
I
have
began
to
understand
what
exactly
employers
are
looking
for
and
have
been
able
to
directly
link
my
experience
back
to
the
job
I
am
applying
for
both
in
my
interview
and
applications
.
The
process
has
allowed
for
new
career
-
related
doors
to
open
for
me
especially
at
the
right
time
too
because
looking
back
I
would
n’t
have
been
able
to
work
for
organisation
during
university
.
Finally
,
I
100
%
believe
that
the
events
,
programmes
and
opportunities
I
have
been
involved
with
at
university
during
my
academic
career
has
proven
to
be
very
fruitful
as
this
was
how
I
was
able
to
pass
my
interview
despite
not
having
an
actual
job
to
prove
my
team
work
,
leadership
,
delivering
at
pace
and
many
more
skills
and
experiences
.
I
am
therefore
very
grateful
to
university
to
have
developed
such
opportunities
for
students
like
myself
to
get
involved
with
and
become
employable
.
I
do
n’t
think
the
positives
of
these
events
are
mentioned
enough
and
I
think
students
should
be
more
encouraged
and
open
into
being
involved
in
such
events
and
programmes
as
they
can
also
learn
valuable
employability
skills
too
especially
during
COVID-19
.
Apologies
for
my
lengthy
email
!
I
hope
you
have
enjoyed
learning
about
the
lessons
I
have
learned
from
this
whole
process
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Sofia
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
Does
this
also
apply
to
the
problem
style
question
,
as
this
is
the
question
I
have
chosen
to
answer
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Pavel
and
Lowell
,
I
hope
you
’re
both
well

Just
to
confirm
,
does
the
module
summative
require
a
bibliography
?

Hi
Karina
,
You
would
n’t
believe
this
,
I
’ve
been
selected
for
another
interview
with
the
organisation
but
this
is
for
the
role
of
a
job_title
!
I
’m
really
excited
about
this
!
I
have
booked
an
appointment
with
yourself
to
discuss
the
competencies
which
will
be
used
in
my
interview
.
Also
,
how
do
you
think
I
can
stand
out
from
other
candidates
in
the
interview
,
by
using
my
organisation
and
job_title
experiences
?

Dear
Zuzana
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
and
clarification
.
I
have
submitted
my
assignment
without
my
bibliography
.
Because
I
have
81
Footnotes
the
word
count
comes
up
as
2557
words
but
I
can
confirm
to
you
that
my
assignment
excluding
footnotes
is
1500
words
.
I
have
declared
this
on
the
cover
page
of
my
assignment
,
and
am
happy
to
provide
further
evidence
if
necessary
.

pumps
are
big
sizes
like
size
1
plus
No
11
sizes
I
ca
n’t
find
any
plain
tops
or
T
-
shirt
’s
They
’re
all
jumpers
and
not
in
Lisandra
’s
size
I
do
n’t
need
a
top
then
leave
it
Shall
I
try
boots
?
Or
will
Carlita
wear
her
plain
blue
T
-
shirt
?
What
’s
the
problem
?
It
was
a
normal
phone
update
like
the
one
we
had
the
other
day
She
was
very
appreciative
of
what
I
said
to
her
.
She
said
she
wanted
to
fit
in
.
She
kept
deleating
accounts
to
have
a
break
as
she
was
fed
up
of
being
someone
she
really
is
not
.
She
knows
she
is
different
on
phone
and
not
on
phone
.
Only
one
friend
knew
she
was
bullied
and
was
supportive
it
was
only
one
time
she
got
water
bombed
.
She
said
she
’s
happy
this
has
happened
as
it
has
pushed
her
to
stop
what
she
did
.

Dear

Thank
you

your

Just
another
question
,
does
Residuary
Estate
and
Residuary
legatees
mean
the
same
thing
?
I.E
if
the
testator
has
requested
their
residuary
estate
to
go
to
a
company
,
Will
that
company
automatically
also
become
the
residuary
legatees
instead
of
the
testator
’s
next
-
of
-
kin
?
Kind

Dear
Julissa
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
For
the
module
Coursework
,
I
have
chosen
to
answer
the
problem
question
.
As
there
are
2
-
3
clauses
whereby
the
Re
Denley
rules
must
be
met
,
am
I
allowed
to
explain
the
rules
in
full
detail
for
the
first
answer
and
then
simply
apply
the
rules
to
the
remaining
answers
?
For
example
if
I
write
:
‘
copied_text
’
Will
this
be
appropriate
for
the
coursework
as
I
also
have
a
word
limit
?

Hi
Lula
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
’ve
got
good
news
for
you
!
My
interview
was
a
success
and
I
have
therefore
secured
the
job
!
I
honestly
ca
n’t
tell
you
how
happy
I
am
!
My
start
date
will
be
in
September
so
that
gives
me
plenty
of
time
to
do
my
exams
without
working
on
the
side
and
to
also
hopefully
pass
my
driving
test
before
I
start
working
full
time
.
Hopefully
if
all
goes
to
plan
in
the
summer
and
the
world
is
okay
,
I
will
definitely
come
to
uni
and
thank
you
personally
.
Thank
you
for
all
your
help
and
support
!
Kind

Hi
Abbey
,
Thank
your

that
!
I
just
wanted
to
ask
,
what
grade
would
you
say
my
practice
assessment
would
have
been
equivalent
to

I
ask
this

I
am

to
achieve
a
high
2:1
grade

would
like
to
know
what
I
need
to
do
to

Thank
you
for
your
email
.
I
only
asked
,
as
my
other
tutors
have
provided
help
in
this
manner
in
the
past
so
I
was
n’t
sure
.
One
particular
question
I
do
have
is
,
in
order
to
secure
a
2:1
in
the
presentation
assignment
,
would
it
be
better
to
have
4
-
5
detailed
arguments
in
the
main
body
or
5
-
6
broad
arguments
in
the
main
body
?
Also
,
are
we
required
to
define
key
terms
in
the
question
or
provide
background
knowledge
or
should
we
go
straight
into
our
arguments
with
regards
to
the
essay
question
?
As
I
remember
you
mentioning
something
regarding
this
a
few
lecture
back
but
I
ca
n’t
remember
what
exactly
you
said
.
Kind
Regards

Dear
Marga
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
For
my
arguments
,
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
include
the
counter
arguments
and
state
reasons
for
why
the
opposing
argument
can
be
discredited
?

Which

Is
it

of
topics
from

Hi
Jeanette
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
With
regards
to
my
preparation
with
my
oral
assessment
,
I
cam
across
an
interesting
point
which
is
highly
relevant
to
the
topic
topic
which
I
am
preparing
for
.
My
point
regards
the
success
of
business
despite
the
fact
business
does
not
have
a
website
to
order
clothes
from
like
other
clothing
brands
do
.
,
meaning
that
during
Lockdown
whilst
other
businesses
such
as
business
and
business
still
gained
profits
from
online
sales
,
business
did
not
because
they
do
n’t
have
a
website
but
their
sales
exceeded
when
they
re
-
opened
after
Lockdown
restrictions
were
eased
.
Do
you
think
the
above
point
is
relevant
for
the
Q
regarding
functional
equivalence
as
I
was
thinking
to
include
this
point
there
?
Or
would
you
recommend
it
in
the
Q
regarding
how
the
Internet
affects
competition
,
free
services
and
abuse
of
dominance
?

Hi
Carrissa
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
have
received
my
coursework
grade
which
was
57
.
I
was
upset
as
I
aimed
for
65
.
On
the
positive
side
I
know
I
will
do
better
in
the
exam
and
still
achieve
a
2.1
overall
in
the
module
as
I
enjoy
the
module
.
However
,
I
would
like
some
more
feedback
regarding
my
coursework
.
Your
feedback
said
my
application
to
the
scenario
was
n’t
accurate
or
was
n’t
enough
.
So
going
forward
for
the
summer
exam
,
what
is
it
exactly
do
I
need
to
do
to
ensure
my
application
to
the
scenario
is
accurate
and
enough
to
secure
a
high
2.1
-
First
Grade
?
I
did
follow
your
suggested
answer
and
I
did
apply
subject
to
the
scenario
as
much
as
I
could
,
so
I
’m
quite
concerned
that
even
after
doing
this
I
still
achieved
a
2.2
instead
of
a
2.1
.

candidate
number
is

got
back
to
me
last
week
regarding
my
interview
.
They
told
me
they

n’t
be
calling

back
for
a

interview
.
I
replied
to
their
email
asking
for

regarding
my
interview
but
I
have
since
had
no
response

To
be
honest
,
I
am
happy
I
was
not
shortlisted
for
a
second

in
the
end

I
did
some
thinking

was

hear
back
from

realised
that

I
really
do
just

get

etc
and
I
felt
that
with
the
COVID
happening
jobs
in
subject
have
become
scarce
so
it
was
better
I
use
my
subject
degree
in
other
sectors
such
as
HR
,
management
and
civil

I
am
also
very
happy
that
I

find

the
Job
Description
.
In
the
document
attached
,
I
have
included
the
section
of
my
application
which
I
will
be
questioned
on
during
my
interview
.
Other
competency
based
questions
they
may
ask
me
are
relating
to
:
Working
together
Making
effective
decisions
Delivering
at
pace
Managing
a
quality
service
They
will
also
ask
me
2
-
3
strength
based
questions
,
whereby
they
will
give
me
a
short
scenario
followed
by
a
question
to
which
I
must
answer
yes
or
no
giving
a
reason
.
For
example
:
‘
You
see
a
person
in
trouble
,
do
you
have
empathy
?
’
–
I
would
answer
Yes
,
because
that
person
is
clearly
not
themselves
which
is
why
they
are
upset
.
If
I
talk
to
this
person
,
I
will
understand
what
has
made
them
upset
and
can
try
and
root
them
to
the
correct
channel
to
seek
help
.

Dear
Patsy
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
I
have
a
question
regarding
the
problem
question
in
the
coursework
.
Does
the
Presumption
of
contract
for
resulting
trusts
apply
if
the
settlor
made
this
trust
in
their
Will
?
And
if
so
would
the
same
rules
apply
in
that
surplus
funds
can
be
kept
by
the
beneficiary
?
I
ask
this
,
because
the
law
on
purpose
trusts
means
these
types
of
trusts
can
only
exist
for
the
purpose
of
charitable
trusts
,
private
purpose
trust
and
anomalous
exceptional
testamentary
private
purpose
trusts
.
The
most
applicable
ground
here
would
the
testamentary
exception
however
that
is
only
valid
for
maintaining
pets
,
tombs
,
gravestones
and
land
etc
.
It
does
n’t
mention
anything
about
maintaining
a
person
,
which
is
why
I
’m
slightly
confused
.

Hi
Tarzan
,
I
had
my
interview
.
It
was
not
a
proper
interview
as
such
,
just
an
informal
chat
.
Carmon
told
me
the
managing
director
was
very
busy
so
she
’s
conducting
these
informal
chats
with

to
get
to
know
us

if
she
likes
us
she
will
put
us
forward
for
an
interview
with
the
managing
director
followed
by
a
vacation
scheme
.
My
interview
lasted
15
minutes
,
but
I
think
it
was
due
to
Mirabel
asking
me
general
questions
.
But
I
could
be
wrong
and
I
feel
a
little
worried
in
that
respect
.
Ichabod
did
n’t
ask
the

we
prepared
for

competency

Kip
asked
me
the
following
questions
:
Asked
about
my
virtual

E.G.
what
I
did
and
I
spoke
about
how
it
helped
me
with
my
time
management
and
helped
me
network
with
other
students
and
she
seemed
to
have
liked
that
response
what
I
study
in
final
year
why
I
applied
to
organisation
,
what
I
got
up
to
in
Lockdown
how
university
is
teaching
us
,
what
I
thought
about
the

where
I
thought
about
doing
my
math
and
what
my
friends
thought
about
doing
the
linguistics
and
being
a
job_title
.
In
most
of
my
answers
,
Nelie
did
smile
a
lot
and
nod
her
head
a
lot

I
’m

Hi
Salli
,
As
mentioned
in
our
meeting
,
please
find
below
an
outline
of
my
communicating
and
influencing
competency
.
Please
can
you
check
it
over
and
see
if
its
strong
to
use
?
Communicating
and
influencing
:
Vice
President
>
responsible
for
handling
student
queries
>
students
did
not
give
us
feedback
,
social
media
attention
difficult
to
gain
>
We
also
needed
to
fill
our
guest
list
in
one
day
as
we
had
an
event
scheduled
2
days
later
but
did
n’t
have
many
attendees
signed
up
.
I
saw
an
opportunity
at
our
Fresher
’s
Fair
and
personally
spoke
to
students
about
what
they
want
to
see
from
the
society
.
>
I
was
able
to
find
my
answers
having
built
a
positive
rapport
with
students
by
asking
them
questions
,
being
pleasant
around
them
and
reassuring
them
with
empathy
as
they
were
first
year
students
Having
relayed
my
student
feedback
to
the
committee
I
decided
to
organise
an
induction
presentation
consisting
of
ice
-
breaker
activities
for
the
students
as
I
saw
this
as
way
for
the
society
to
gain
exposure
and
for
the
students
to
get
to
know
each
other
as
they
were
new
.
I
therefore
effectively
communicated
with
the
programme
director
by
asking
her
if
the
society
can
have
a
slot
at
the
induction
lecture
.
Here
I
stressed
the
importance
and
value
of
students
joining
the
society
.
the
programme
director
agreed
with
my
suggestion
and
gave
us
slot
.
I
then
created
a
PowerPoint
presentation
highlighting
purpose
,
values
of
society
and
what
our
plans
were
and
incorporated
ice
breakers
into
this
.
Delivered
lecture
with
myself
and
committee
members
Overcome
>
really
positive
.
First
years
benefitted
with
interacting
with
current
students
as
this
gave
them
confidence
,
able
to
fill
our
guest
list
and
students
were
happy
to
pay
us
an
entry
fee
,
recruited
additional
society
members
who
always
gave
us
good
feedback
upon
reviewing
As
a
result
I
was
very
proud
of
being
able
to
communicate
with
other
members
of
the
organisation
of
all
levels
when
implementing
my
ideas
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Bennie
,
Have
you
heard
anything
back
from
organisation
regarding
the
social
media
question
?
I
had
a
think
about
it
,
and
I
am
happy
for
my
photograph
to
be
included
.
Also
,
because
I
feel
that
your
help
and
support
with
my
applications
and
mock
interviews
really
contributed
to
the
success
of
my
job
,
I
have
therefore
recommended
you
to
my
friends
!
So
just
to
give
you
a
heads
up
,
over
the
next
few
weeks
,
you
’ll
probably
be
bombarded
with
lots
of
emails
asking
for
help
with
applications
by
all
my
friends
.
Kind
Regards
,

Dear
Dorolisa
,
Where
exactly
can
I
locate
the
list
of
questions
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Viva
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
Is
there
a
Peer
Review
Report
template
on
system
,
I
can
use
?
Or
do
I
need
to
create
one
myself
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Elwina
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
First
of
all
,
I
would
like
to
say
Thank
You
for
considering
my
suggestions
with
regards
to
the
peer
review
task
in
webinars
,
I
really
appreciated
it
!
Ironically
shortly
after
you
introduced
this
,
my
friend
offered
to
pair
up
with
me
to
do
the
peer
review
task
instead
of
going
to
the
webinar
.
Secondly
,
with
regards
to
submitting
a
sample
of
my
main
assessment
to
yourself
,
does
the
peer
review
task
need
to
be
completed
now
or
can
this
be
completed
after
the
sample
assessment
submission
deadline
,
before
the
October
deadline
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Barnabe
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
the
confirmation
.
In
that
case
,
in
my
introduction
shall
I
list
my
3
recommendations
but
say
I
will
only
focus
on
2
in
-
depth
recommendations
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Darth
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
,
I
have
located
the
questions
.
As
you
know
my
assignment
is
about
recommendations
addressing
the
weaknesses
of
ICC
Anti
-
Corruption
Code
,
how
many
recommendations
do
you
think
I
should
include
?
Currently
I
have
included
3
but
my
word
count
is
going
over
3,000
words
,
Do
you
think
that
by
reducing
my
recommendations
to
2
,
would
this
still
sound
academic
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Genovera
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
and
feedback
!
One
final
question
I
have
,
is
in
order
to
secure
a
high
2:1
or
First
in
the
oral
assessment
,
is
there
anything
in
addition
to
the
feedback
you
have
given
me
,
I
need
to
do
to
secure
a
grade
like
this
?
For
example
,
when
referring
to
cases
,
will
discussing
the
purpose
and
reason
behind
a
court
ruling
in
a
case
boost
my
marks
compared
to
citing
them
in
general
terms
?
Kind
Regards
,

Hi
Jamie
,
I
hope
you
have
been
coping
well
in
this
current
pandemic
crisis
.
It
has
been
a
very
long
time
since
we
last
spoke
to
each
other
!
How
are
you
?
I
just
wanted
to
say
Good
Luck
with
studying
your
course
and
good
luck
with
your
training
contract
with
organisation
!
I
am
currently
in
my
final
year
and
although
the
workload
is
tough
I
am
happy
I
’ll
be
graduating
a
year
earlier
than
I
had
expected
.
I
’ve
also
passed
my
theory
test
and
have
booked
my
driving
test
!
All
The
Best

Hi
Ginnifer
,
Apologies
for
my
later
response
,
I
have
only
just
managed
to
balance
my
work
load
now
!
I
am
enjoying
final
year
,
I
love
the
modules
i
’m
studying
.
The
only
difficulty
is
time
management
as
we
now
have
seminars
every
week
instead
of
every
2
weeks
but
I
am
now
used
to
this
intense
workload
.
How
are
you
finding
the
course
?
What
does
it
involve
you
doing
?
Does
the
course
seem
as
though
you
are
simply
studying
your
final
year
at
uni
again
?
Have
you
made
any
friends
on
your
course
?
Just
to
let
you
know
,
organisation
are
recruiting
for
trainee
job_title
for
5565
and
I
have
already
drafted
my
application
.
It
is
currently
being
reviewed
by
Jessamine
.
Their
main
Q
was
‘
why
should
we
employ
you
’
.
For
that
Q
I
wrote
about
my
experience
and
skills
but
have
not
mentioned
anything
about
your
friend
who
works
there
as
I
was
n’t
sure
if
it
was
relevant
to
the
Q.
What
do
you
think
?
I
hope
you
’re
enjoying
your
course
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Arliene
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
When
will
I
be
receiving
your
feedback
regarding
my
Main
Assessment
Proposal
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Hi
Bertine
,
Thank
you
for
confirming
this
to
me
.
As
it
says
on
the
website
,
will
course
graduates
also
be
able
to
hire
a
gown
for
the
online
graduation
ceremony
?
Or
is
it
possible
for
you
to
suggest
this
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Hi
Jermaine
,
Thank
you
!
Honestly
,
my
mom
’s
over
the
moon
about
this
,
as
it
’s
my
first
ever
job
that
too
with
organisation
as
I
’m
now
set
up
for
life
!
My
mom
said
she
knew
all
along
I
’ll
get
the
job
and
even
brought
me
clothes
.
In
all
fairness
,
given
the
grammar
errors
in
my
application
and
my
good
interview
I
did
think
in
my
heart
the
job
was
mine
but
I
wanted
to
be
certain
.
They
called
me
at
15.00
but
I
missed
the
call
which
made
my
mom
throw
digs
at
me
all
afternoon
until
16.30
when
they
rang
me
again
to
tell
me
I
had
the
job
.
Now
that
I
’m
in
the
organisation
after
a
stressful
year
of
trying
to
get
in
,
I
can
going
forward
move
to
different
departments
and
still
pursue
my
aspirations
of
working
in
the
organisation
as
it
will
be
easier
to
apply
for
these
roles
as
an
internal
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Hi
Rosabella
,
Thank
you
!
Just
to
give
you
some
background
information
,
the
job
role
is
:
job_title
.
I
will
be
working
in
the
probate
department
in
the
organisation
.
My
start
date
is
n’t
until
July
so
I
have
plenty
of
time
to
focus
on
finishing
off
uni
.
Now
I
’m
just
waiting
for
the
pre
-
employment
checks
to
be
carried
out
.
However
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
the
help
and
support
provided
by
yourself
and
the
university
has
really
helped
me
in
securing
this
job
and
I
am
very
thankful
for
the
help
I
’ve
received
.
I
definitely
suggest
more
employability
events
like
event
should
continue
to
run
across
university
to
allow
students
who
are
also
in
my
situation
to
gain
skills
on
how
to
secure
a
job
especially
during
COVID-19
.
Kind
Regards
,
..
Luther
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
suggestion
.
At
first
I
did
think
this
was
something
worth
mentioning
but
I
was
n’t
sure
so
I
am
glad
I
asked
you
!
Would
it
be
okay
if
after
I
have
finalised
my
application
,
if
I
could
send
you
that
one
answer
of
mine
for
you
to
give
a
general
comment
?
I
know
that
you
wo
nt
give
a
professional
review
of
it
but
because
you
were
successful
with
your
application
,
I
feel
your
opinion
would
be
valuable
to
me
.
At
uni
I
am
studying
module
,
module
and
module
alongside
the
2
core
modules
which
are
module
and
module
.
In
regards
to
your
course
,
at
least
you
already
know
3
people
on
your
course
.
It
makes
things
easier
if
you
need
help
with
anything
!
So
with
your
course
do
you
do
tasks
which
involve
letter
writing
?
Or
taking
client
interviews
?

Regards
,

Hi
Morten
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
have
a
question
regarding
our
written
coursework
.
When
referring
to
prohibited
conduct
in
Chapter
I
of
the
Competition
Act
1998
,
am
I
allowed
to
link
this
with
the
prohibitions
founded
in
Article
101

,
as
it
is
very
similar
if
not
identical
?

Hi
Mirilla
,
Thank
you
for
email
.
Yes
my
question
was
answered
in
yesterday
’s
webinar
.
I
have
one
more
question
.
In
the
coursework
for
question
3
,
am
I
only
supposed
to
talk
about
the
disadvantages
about
the
topic
and
not
the
advantages
?
Even
though
the
question
asks
for
a
critical
analysis
?

Hi
Pollyanna
,
I
hope
you
and
your
family
are
well
.
How
is
your
husband
now
?
I
am
emailing
you
to
let
you
know
that
I
have
applied
to
organisation
for
their
training
contract
commencing
in
219
.
As
they
are
a
high
street
firm
,
they
asked
me
to
email
them
my
application
which
I
did
yesterday
morning
.
They
also
said
there
is
no
deadline
,
so
I
was
wondering
if
you
would
know
what
time
frame
should
I
expect
to
hear
back
from
them
?
Kind

Dear
Charlie
,
I
hope
you
’re
well
.
With
regards
to
my
main
assessment
question
,
I
have
had
a
change
of
mind
but
I
’m
not
entirely
sure
how
workable
it
will
be
.
Initially
I
wanted
to
focus
my
main
assessment
on
the
Silk
Road
Scandal
for
reasons
stated
in
my
presentation
.
My
question
was
‘
assignment_title
’
.
However
,
as
I
have
lots
of
knowledge
and
insights
about
FBC
in
match
fixing
and
with
FBC
existing
in
countries
with
similar
cultures
and
economies
;
I
want
to
incorporate
this
to
conclude
that
FBC
is
determined
by
culture
.
My
conclusion
will
be
that
FBC
is
difficult
to
erase
from
society
because
the
criminals
tend
to
be
foreigners
who
have
immense
knowledge
in
computer
science
and
their
culture
and
economic
status
motivates
them
to
commit
the
fraud
.
Which
is
why
silk
road
still
exists
today
despite
FBI
arresting
lots
of
operators
of
it
and
shutting
down
the
website
.
With
this
I
have
thought
of
a
new
question
which
is
:
‘
assignment_title
’
With
the
above
Question
I
will
only
focus
on
Silk
Road
scandal
,
corruption
and
bribery
in
cricket
match
-
fixing
and
how
FBC
occurs
mainly
in
European
countries
based
on
culture
as
Silk
Road
was
established
by
an
Icelandic
man
.
My
3
academic
disciplines
will
remain
the
same
as
shown
in
my
engagement
presentation
.
Is
the
new
question
appropriate
for
me
to
use
,
to
allow
me
to
incorporate
all
of
the
above
information
?
P.S.
Apologies
for
my
lengthy
email
!
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Anni
,
Thank
your
for
your
email
and
feedback
.
I
have
thought
about
your
response
yesterday
,
and
I
do
believe
that
my
original
question
is
much
better
as
it
is
very
focused
.
Initially
I
was
unsure
if
it
would
work
as
I
was
n’t
sure
I
would
find
any
resources
as
this
is
an
American
Case
.
However
,
I
have
spent
some
time
researching
into
Silk
Road
and
have
found
a
number
of
credible
journal
articles
and
research
pieces
from
both
American
and
English
Law
sources
which
I
will
definitely
be
using
in
my
assessment
and
now
feel
very
confident
going
forward
with
this
.
It
also
helps
that
Silk
Road
was
a
form
of
money
laundering
through
the
use
of
the
dark
web
so
I
am
very
happy
with
that
.
One
question
I
do
have
,
is
for
my
proposal
are
a
mix
of
journal
articles
,
news
articles
and
websites
appropriate
for
my
sources
section
?
Kind
Regards
,
..
Dear
Leelah
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
.
In
my
presentation

how
exactly
will
you
know
I
have
referred
to
and
discussed
academic
literature
?
For
example
,
when
I
speak
,
should
I
say
as
X
author
stated
in
X
journal
article
?

I
am
going
to
mention
that
regulations
on
prohibiting
minors
from
watching
18
rated
films
is
difficult
to
regulate
over
online
sources
such
as
Netflix
and
Prime
Video
because
ID
is
not
required
there
compared
to
cinemas
which
ultimately
restricts
competition
because
people
will
less
likely
go
to
the
cinema
for
these
reasons
.
I
found
a
useful
academic
journal
regarding
this
matter
,
so
will
this
be
okay
for
me
to
include
,
when
evaluating
the
extent
to
which
topic
applies
to
topic
analysis
?
Also
if
for
whatever
reason
,
my
assessment
lasts
3040
minutes
,
will
I
have
marks
deducted
because
the
assessment
did
not
last
1520
minutes
?

Abstract
59
undergraduate
psychology
students
replicated
the
Stroop
test
,
and
the
understanding
of
cognitive
interference
.
This
therefore
allows
for
further
research
on
brain
regions
related
to
the
Stroop
test
,
assisting
in
treatment
and
recovery
of
individuals
with
brain
damage
in
these
areas
.
Future
research
testing
various
groups
of
people
,
such
as
cognitively
impaired
,
could
provide
useful
when
investigating
which
brain
regions
affect
reaction
times
in
the
incongruent
condition
,
demonstrating
the
full
extent
of
the
effect
of
the
Stroop
test
.

Hi
Paulie
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
the
lovely
reply
.
It
means
a
lot
!
It
turns
out
that
the
exceptional
circumstances
form
will
not
be
approved
until
June
and
as
I
have
no
evidence
of
the
current
situation
I
am
not
really
sure
if
it
will
be
approved
.
Therefore
I
'm
trying
my
best
to
complete
the
coursework
before
the
deadline
.
I
'm
really
struggling
with
how
to
analyse
and
come
up
with
discourses
for
my
transcript
and
I
'm
not
really
sure
where
to
start
.
My
topic
is
:
topic
My
research
Q
is
:
assignment_title
I
'm
not
sure
how
much
you
're
allowed
to
help
but
so
far
after
looking
at
the
transcript
I
can
come
up
with
3
'
themes
'
:
1
.
Racial
Equality
Advocate
,
where
my
interviewee
talks
about
her
opinions
on
racial
quality
and
the
representation
in
the
media
.
2
.
Feminist
Equality
Advocate
,
where
my
interviewee
talks
about
her
opinions
on
the
equality
of
females
and
males
and
the
representation
in
media
3
.
Identity
,
where
my
interviewee
talks
about
her
identity
and
how
that
fits
into
her
views
and
the
representation
of
her
own
culture
in
media
.
To
be
quite
honest
I
'm
just
very
confused
as
to
whether
I
'm
on
the
right
track
,
and
I
'm
finding
it
really
hard
to
concentrate
and
analyse
what
my
interviewee
is
saying
as
I
do
n't
know
how
to
read
it
into
it
further
.
Please
help
if
you
can
!

regards

Results
Data
treatment
After
the
data
was
recorded
,
the
alpha
channel
was
duplicated
which
made
it
easier
to
keep
track
of
the
transformations
made
to
the
signal
.
Reflection
I
have
achieved
a
general
understanding
of
physiological
measurement
using
Biopac
from
conducting
this
study
,
as
I
have
learnt
how
to
use
the
system
to
rectify
and
integrate
data
in
order
for
it
to
be
more
understandable
to
analyse
.
As
a
group
,
we
found
the
placement
of
the
electrodes
using
the
international
1020
positioning
system
fairly
difficult
,
as
it
was
n’t
particularly
clear
where
exactly
to
place
them
on
the
scalp
.
We
had
to
change
the
positioning
of
the
electrodes
and
remove
the
dead
skin
from
the
scalp
a
few
times
until
the
impedance
was
low
enough
to
continue
the
rest
of
the
experiment
.
I
did
n’t
enjoy
placing
the
electrodes
on
the
participant
’s
scalp
and
measuring
the
distance
between
the
nasion
and
the
inion
because
both
tasks
were
meticulous
and
required
a
lot
of
patience
.
However
,
I
did
enjoy
using
Biopac
to
rectify
the
data
in
order
to
see
clearly
the
brainwaves
of
the
participant
and
how
it
correlated
with
whether
their
eyes
were
open
or
closed
.
In
order
to
improve
the
experiment
,
I
would
reduce
the
number
of
confounding
variables
by
ensuring
the
participant
was
n’t
blinking
,
talking
or
chewing
during
the
experiment
,
as
these
artifacts
may
have
had
an
impact
on
the
data
used
for
analysis
.
Additionally
,
I
would
have
ensured
the
experiment
took
part
in
a
quiet
room
away
from
other
people
as
it
is
more
likely
for
the
brainwave
activity
to
be
due
to
whether
the
participant
’s
eyes
were
open
or
closed
rather
than
distractions
.
Thanks
for
getting
back
to
me
.
I
'll
try
my
best
to
record
the
session
but
I
'll
have
to
ask
the
speakers
if
they
're
okay
with
it
.
Much
appreciated
for
your
support
it
means
a
lot
.
Where
can
I
access
some
resources
which
would
be
useful
for
my
members
?

Hey
Markos
,
Thank
you
so
much
!
I
'm
living
off

campus
with
two
of
my
friends
.
In
terms
of
food
and
supplies
we
'll
be
okay
for
the
first
few
days
of
isolation
but
not
really
sure
what
we
're
going
to
do
once
we
run
out
!
I
had
my
test
on
Thursday
and
got
results
on
Tuesday
.
I
've
had
symptoms
for
7
days
now
.
I
've
been
isolating
ever
since
.
I
was
thinking
to
get
another
test
,
along
with
my
2
other
housemates
,
nearer
to
the
end
of
this
isolation
period
to
see
if
I
'm
still
negative
.
It
means
a
lot

Assessing
Attitudes
Towards
Zoos
Introduction
:
This
study
’s
hypothesis
is
that
participant
’s
attitudes
towards
zoos
would
have
a
wide
variation
.
This
is
because
some
participants
may
have
a
positive
attitude
due
to
their
involvement
in
conserving
species
,
and
some
a
negative
attitude
due
to
animal
captivity
.
Reade
and
Waran
.
The
larger
SD
of
the
final
responses
of
the
positive
statements
indicate
that
the
results
are
widely
spread
across
the
mean
,
while
the
smaller
SDs
for
the
negative
statements
suggest
that
there
was
less
of
a
variation
in
responses
to
these
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
participant
’s
attitudes
towards
zoos
do
not
have
a

Apologies
for
the
late
response
,
I
just
wanted
to
say
a
massive
thank
you
for
helping
me
out
.
I
successfully
managed
to
submit
it
on
time
and
I
'd
like
to
say
I
'm
quite
pleased
with
it
.
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
just
sit
down
and
get
on
with
it
but
I
'm
glad
I
managed
to
do
it
.
Your
support
not
only
personally
but
with
the
society
this
term
has
been
noticed
and
appreciated
so
thank
you
.
Wishing
you
a
lovely
lovely
Christmas
and
will
speak
in
the
New
Year
.
Kind
regards

Hi
Sharron
,
I
'm
trying
to
complete
the
study
:
assignment_title
.
on
system
and
I
have
completed
the
survey
section
of
your
study
.
When
I
clicked
Next
for
the
topic
experiment
I
was
left
on
a
page
saying
"
initialising
the
experiment
...
"
.
I
tried
opening
the
same
page
on
Google
Chrome
yet
still
the
same
thing
pops
up
.
I
am
completing
this
experiment
on

Will
I
still
be
able
to
get
the

?
Thanks

Hi

I
was
just
wondering
about
the
module
Report
2
deadline
as
I
've
seen
on
the
university
website
that
courseworks
that
are
due
between
3208
-
3585
September
have
a
5
working
day
deadline
.
Would
this
apply
to
our
assignment
originally
due
5622
October
?
So
am
I
right
to
believe
that
the
extended
deadline
is
3949
July
with
no
penalty
of
submitting
up
to
that
date
?
Thank
you

that

so

Hi
Nananne
and
Ed
,
Hope
you
are
both
staying
safe
,
I
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
I
was
aware
that
the
deadline
for
both
the
topic
and
the
topic
task
was
4896
September
due
to
the
5
working
day
extension
.
For
this
reason
,
although
I
had
finished
my
first
draft
for
both
before
1854
June
,
the
original
deadline
,
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
look
back
at
my
assignments
after
a
short
period
of
time
to
amend
small
changes
in
which
I
knew
I
would
have
time
to
do
.
I
submitted
these
first
drafts
so
that
I
could
focus
on
my
exams
,
but
I
wanted
to
look
back
at
them
later
.
I
double
checked
on
system
to
make
sure
that
I
could
resubmit
it
at
a
later
date
and
there
was
no
information
saying
that
after
the
original
deadline
I
would
not
be
able
to
resubmit
it
.
I
am
quite
disappointed
that
I
will
not
be
able
to
resubmit
my
edited
versions
of
the
courseworks
,
despite
still
meeting
the
5day
extension
deadline
,
as
I
had
no
idea
that
I
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
so
.
I
have
attached
the
versions
I
would
prefer
to
be
marked
in
this
email
.
I
am
also
aware
that
other
students
are
disappointed
with
this
aswell
,
as
I
am
sure
that
you
both
are
aware
that
after
a
short
period
of
time
away
from
courseworks
,
it
enables
you
to
look
at
it
in
a
different
light
and
amend
changes
from
a
different
perspective
.
Thank
you

-

you

can

this
?
Thank

Hi

I

you

Hi
sir
,
Hope
you
are
keeping
well
amidst
this
pandemic
.
I
'm
just
emailing
in
regards
to
the
first
assignment
which
is
due
on
the
3487
,
I
was
wondering
,
when
defining
the
state
and
writing
about
my
thinker
,
would
I
also
speak
about
their
views
on
state
of
nature
?
So
,
for
example
,
I
'm
currently
writing
about
Hobbes
and
how
he
advocated
for
an
authoritarian
government
,
and
I
am
then
going
to
use
Locke
and
other
thinkers
to
dispute
his
beliefs
and
explain
why
they
are
outdated
,
and
,
essentially
a
bit
useless
in
defining
the
modern
state
as
it
is
today
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
if
I
need
to
speak
about
each
thinker
's
own
personal
view
on
human
nature
itself
as
well
?
I
understand
that
some
of
their
views
on
human
nature
lead
to
why
they
would
define
the
state
in
the
way
that
they
do
but
how
extensively
would
I
go
into
speaking
about
this
state
of
nature
?
Apologies
is
that
's
confusing
to
understand
.
Kind
regards
,
.

Subsequent
to
losing
the
1983
election
on
a
hardline
socialist
programme
,
it
became
clear
that
a
rebranding
of
the
Labour
Party
was
crucial
.
The
term
"
New
Labour
"
was
initially
coined
by
Tony
Blair
at
the
1994
Labour
Party
Conference
,
inspired
by
sociologist
Anthony
Giddens
who
believed
that
it
was
important
to
find
a
"
third
way
"
between
Thatcherism
and
traditional
socialism
.
The
question
in
hand
explores
the
way
in
which
the
Labour
Party
’s
place
on
the
political
spectrum
has
changed
through
the
complexities
of
several
policies
introduced
over
the
years
.
In
this
essay
,
I
will
be
assessing
the
extent
to
which
the
Labour
Party
has
been
redefined
from
the
Blair
-
era
over
two
decades
ago
,
to
Corbynism
today
.
It
is
worthwhile
dealing
with
the
topic
at
hand
as
politics
is
a
subject
which
needs
to
be
continuously
adapting
to
reflect
changes
in
global
dynamics
,
this
topic
in
particular
reveals
how
government
policies
develop
to
maintain
dialogue
and
preserve
stability
in
an
increasingly
fragile
and
threatened
geopolitical
system
.
Blair
’s
creation
of
New
Labour
attempted
to
formulate
an
alternative
to
traditional
social
democracy
and
free
-
market
neo
-
liberalism
in
the
context
of
a
modern
globalised
economy
.
This
neo
-
revisionism
advocated
a
balance
of
rights
and
responsibilities
,
resulting
in
communitarian
liberalism
which
emphasised
that
personal
autonomy
operates
within
a
communal
context
based
on
mutual
dependence
and
benefit
.
As
Brown
’s
government
ensured
no
radical
breakaway
from
New
Labour
,
ideals
and
principles
of
the
Labour
Party
remained
the
same
for
many
years
.
However
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
Labour
government
’s
failures
in
the
early
21st
century
appear
to
have
fundamentally
changed
voters
’
views
on
whether
Labour
can
be
trusted
on
the
economy
,
leading
to
a
Conservative
victory
in
the
2010
general
election
.
This
is
largely
significant
as
throughout
the
recent
years
,
the
Labour
Party
seems
to
have
adopted
more
socialist
principles
,
evident
in
Corbyn
’s
left
-
wing
agenda
.
Therefore
,
I
aim
to
argue
that
the
Labour
party
has
evolved
to
a
large
extent
over
the
years
due
to
many
successes
and
failures
of
the
party
leaders
’
policies
.
In
this
essay
I
have
used
a
range
of
books
,
websites
and
JSTOR
journals
.
Previously
published
academic
works
include
New
Labour
Hard
Labour
?
Restructuring
and
resistance
in
the
welfare
industry
by
Gerry
Mooney
and
Alex
Law
,
as
well
as
books
such
as
Leadership
and
the
Labour
Party
by
John
Gaffney
.
In
these
sources
,
the
key
concepts
are
focussing
on
New
Labours
’
appeal
to
the
masses
and
rebranding
of
the
party
.
These
journals
and
books
gave
clear
statistics
taking
an
innovative
approach
as
well
as
differing
opinions
on
the
main
policies
which
redefined
the
Labour
Party
which
provided
useful
insight
and
information
.
To
gain
better
understanding
of
the
authors
to
ensure
reliability
of
my
resources
I
also
did
some
prior
research
on
them
.
There
were
many
crossovers
to
other
academic
disciplines
such
as
economics
and
history
,
especially
when
researching
Blair
and
Brown
’s
economic
policies
there
were
many
statistics
and
economic
theory
.
However
,
there
were
also
weaknesses
in
the
sources
I
used
such
as
the
author
’s
personal
opinion
being
a
large
influence
.
After
four
general
election
defeats
,
the
Labour
Party
realised
that
traditional
class
-
based
political
ideas
and
concepts
were
no
longer
seen
as
acceptable
by
the
British
electorate
.
As
a
result
,
the
New
Labour
governments
aimed
to
differentiate
themselves
from
earlier
social
democratic
administrations
,
by
conserving
resources
before
investing
more
in
key
public
services
.
Blair
modernised
the
Labour
party
to
appeal
more
to
middle
-
class
voters
by
moving
away
from
traditional
policies
such
as
nationalisation
and
emphasising
constitutional
reform
.
‘
Clause
IV
’
of
the
party
constitution
was
abandoned
,
ties
with
trade
unions
were
loosened
and
the
party
moved
away
from
its
previously
hard
-
left
position
.
Labour
also
became
more
pro
-
European
as
the
EU
adopted
policies
that
protected
workers
’
rights
such
as
the
Social
Chapter
,
and
the
Third
way
brought
market
models
to
some
government
-
run
services
and
aroused
interest
across
the
western
world
.
Labour
policies
were
largely
based
around
the
free
-
market
,
which
was
accepted
as
the
best
form
of
wealth
creation
with
further
privatisation
and
reduced
corporate
taxes
to
encourage
enterprise
.
Greater
emphasis
was
placed
on
individualism
and
communitarianism
with
the
belief
that
the
individual
should
realise
their
own
potential
and
that
everyone
has
a
responsibility
to
care
for
the
community
collectively
.
Moreover
,
"
as
part
of
its
wider
reform
of
the
welfare
and
modernisation
agendas
,
New
Labour
[
had
]
sought
to
emphasise
the
role
and
responsibilities
of
family
and
community
in
the
provision
of
welfare
services
"
being
one
of
the
boldest
.
Corbyn
strongly
opposed
benefit
cuts
and
a
socialist
he
regarded
the
poor
as
the
victims
of
capitalism
,
who
are
entitled
to
public
support
.
He
opposed
the
use
of
the
private
sector
to
deliver
public
services
–
a
central
aspect
of
New
Labour
.
Thus
,
he
argued
for
a
wholly
state
-
run
NHS
.
In
order
to
promote
lifelong
education
and
training
,
he
called
for
a
national
education
service
,
and
opposed
student
tuition
fees
.
By
contrast
,
Ed
Miliband
had
confined
himself
to
advocating
their
reduction
from
£
9,000
to
£
6,000
a
year
.
In
terms
of
law
and
order
policy
,
Corbyn
was
opposed
to
the
more
hard
-
line
policies
of
the
New
Labour
era
,
such
as
increased
powers
to
combat
terrorism
and
the
introduction
of
identity
cards
.
This
became
a
less
controversial
policy
area
within
the
labour
party
–
both
Blairites
and
Corbynites
found
common
ground
in
opposing
government
cuts
to
police
number
.
Corbyn
consistently
voted
against
the
use
of
force
and
favoured
the
withdrawal
of
the
UK
from
NATO
’s
military
structure
and
the
abolition
of
the
Trident
nuclear
weapons
system
,
again
placing
him
at
odds
with
New
Labour
.
`
He
followed
the
mainstream
of
his
party
in
supporting
continued
British
membership
of
the
EU
,
emphasising
its
positive
role
in
protecting
workers
’
rights
.
In
conclusion
,
it
is
evident
that
the
Labour
Party
had
been
redefined
to
a
large
extent
,
beginning
as
a
more
centrist
party
in
1997
and
eventually
becoming
a
more
radical
socialist
party
in
present
day
.
Through
several
policy
failures
,
the
Labour
Party
established
that
it
needed
to
rebrand
itself
once
again
to
adapt
to
current
affairs
.
It
is
evident
that
Gordon
Brown
maintained
a
large
amount
of
the
New
Labour
principles
however
,
Ed
Miliband
realised
that
this
new
and
reformed
party
was
n’t
going
to
get
them
through
the
2015
election
.
This
resulted
in
more
left
-
wing
agendas
being
proposed
and
the
Labour
Party
promoting
themselves
as
a
more
socialist
organisation
.
Thus
,
to
conclude
,
the
Labour
Party
has
been
redefined
to
a
large
extent
with
several
shifts
throughout
the
political
spectrum
over
the
years
.

Hi
sir
,
Earlier
last
month
I
emailed
you
about
an
exam
which
I
had
submitted
and
was
unsure
if
the
submission
had
gone
through
.
organisation
just
got
back
to
me
and
told
me
it
was
n’t
submitted
but
I
do
n’t
have
any
reassurance
on
what
may
happen
as
obviously
it
is
up
to
the
exam
board
.
I
’m
awfully
worried
because
I
did
submit
it
,
I
kept
the
original
document
which
shows
the
time
and
date
the
document
was
last
modified
and
I
do
n’t
mind
retaking
the
exam
itself
in
October
again
but
I
’m
really
hoping
that
I
’m
not
made
to
retake
the
entire
year
again
.
I
hope
I
’m
not
being
dramatic
but
I
am
very
anxious
as
2
of
my
exams
earlier
this
year
did
n’t
go
amazingly
well
either
and
I
just
need
to
know
if
anything
can
be
done
regarding
this
situation
.
Kind

,

Hello
,
Thank
you
so
much
for
your
patience

Just
an
update
,
our
new
sofas
are
scheduled
to
arrive
on
the

of
December
.
We
could
possible
receive
them
a
little
earlier
,
but
I
hope
this
time
frame
is
okay
for
you
?
Hi
thank
you
for
responding
,
Do
you
know
why
that
may
be
?
I
submitted
my
exam
as
a
Microsoft
word
document
,
and
on
safari
,
I
received
the
message
at
the
top
of
the
screen
saying
it
had
been
submitted
but
did
not
receive
a
receipt
.
I
also
still
have
the
original
exam
which
shows
the
last
time
and
date
it
was
modified
,
I
’m
just
worried
I
’ll
be
made
to
retake
the
first
year
again
and
I
really
hope
that
’s
not
the
case
.
Also
,
will
the
exam
retakes
be
online
or
on
campus
?
Hi
,
I
have
a
booking
for
October
at

was
wondering
if
I
could
by
any
chance
change
my
room
because
of
the
floor
that
I
’m
living
on
?
.
I
cancelled
this
why
am
I
still
being
charged
?
Hi
hun
I
’m
ready
to
sell
the
sofa
now
.
Let
me
know
when
you
are
ready
to
buy

Paypal
does
n’t
work
like
that

When
you
send
money
via
Paypal
it
comes
to
the
account
directly
and
they
do
n’t
say
anything
to
you
.
Thank
you
,
have
a
good
day
.
ically
can
you
please
help
me
structure
the
essay
and
make
it
clear
what
exactly
my
argument
is
because
I
’m
so
lost
right
now
in
trying
to
link
Hobbes
to
the
state
Essentially
I
’m
trying
to
argue
that
Locke
describes
the
modern
state
better
though
Hobbes
is
important
in
understanding
sovereignty
etc

Thank
you
for
your

Hi
,
I
moved
out
of
my
accommodation
a
few
days
after
university
closed
and
was
n’t
able
to
return
my
key
as
there
was
relatively
little
people
on
campus
and
would
n’t
be
able
to
leave
the
site
without
my
key
.
Reception
had
also
closed
by
the
time
so
I
was
n’t
sure
where
to
return
my
key
and
now
as
the
reception
is
closed
I
am
confused
on
how
I
can
return
my
key
for
my
accommodation
?

pieces

added
in
red
and

be
sure
to
make
some
changes
.
Once
I
’ve
completed
that
I
will
send
you
a
last
draft
to
ensure
the
question
is
perfect

this

Hi
Sir
,
I
've
accidentally
submitted
my
module
exam
as
a
Word
Document
,
I
also
have
n't
received
a
system
receipt
,
is
there
anything
that
can
be
done
about
this
,
I
just
want
to
make
sure
my
submission
went
through
.
I
have
emailed
the
organisation
as
well
as
the
organisation
and
they
are
requiring
a
downloadable
receipt
from
system
which
I
can
not
access
nor
find
as
the
submission
bar
is
no
longer
there
.
Please
let
me
know
what
can
be
done
,
thank
you
.
Hi

you

I

Hi
I
’ve
contact

to
say
I
submitted
my
work
on
the
3305
of
July
for
module
as
a
word
document
and
not
a
pdf
.
Is
this
okay
or
will
this
be
a
problem
for
me
?
I
have
n’t
received
a
digital
receipt
but
I
submitted
this
around
11
pm
on
the

Hi

could
discuss
?

but
my
mother
is
going

paying

I

mine
.
Do
give
me
a
call
when
you
’re
free
my
dad
is
ready
to
discuss
moving
forward
.

Hi
Lucien
,
Thank
you
for
your
interest
in
the
sofas
!
These
will
be
available
in
6
-
8
weeks
,
I
hope
this
is
okay
for
you
?
This
is
a
perfect
price
and
am
happy
to
sell
this
to
you
.
Kind
regards
,
.
I
am
perfectly
happy
to
proceed
as
long
as
you
are
aware
that
I
am
only
selling
this
sofa
in
6
-
8
weeks
,
if
you
’d
like
I
can
reserve
this
for
you
for
these
next
few
weeks
and
you
can
make
the
payment
closer
to
the
time
?
Kind

Hi
Dimitry
,
This
sofa
is
currently
being
sold
by
my
father
and
I
am
just
advertising
it
for
him
.
The
situation
right
now
is
that
obviously
we
are
redecorating
the
house
and
still
have
to
search
for
new
sofa
’s
and
purchase
them
,
this
will
take
roughly
6
-
8
weeks
hence
why
I
do
n’t
want
you
to
pay
for
the
sofa
just
yet
.
I
am
happy
to
reserve
it
for
you
in
the
meanwhile
and
you
are
welcome
to
continue
searching
for
sofa
’s
,
but
this
will
be
reserved
for
you
until
you
state
otherwise
.
I
will
keep
you
updated
on
what
is
happening
and
when
this
will
be
properly
ready
to
be
sold
and
sent
!
I
hope
you
are
not
in
a
rush
to
receive
this
sofa
,
and
thank
you
for
your
interest
.
King

Hi
,
I
’m
a
current
student
at
university
and
I
have
emailed
the
organisation
a
few
times
regarding
one
of
my
exams
with
no
response
in
over
a
month
.
I
submitted
an
exam
on
the
5306
of
June
and
I
never
received
a
system
receipt
for
my
exam
so
I
’m
worried
the
submission
did
n’t
go
through
.
On
the
day
itself
the
webpage
said
it
was
a
successful
submission
but
as
I
did
n’t
get
the
receipt
I
’m
assuming
it
did
n’t
submit
.
I
have
kept
the
original
word
document
and
have
n’t
modified
it
since
.
I
do
n’t
want
this
to
affect
my
progression
into
second
year
so
I
would
please
like
an
update
on
this
situation
.
Kind
regards
,

Apologies

I
sent
the
previous
email
in
error
however
I
received
an
email
about
my
attendance
and
have
been
told
to
contact
you
therefore
,
I
am
emailing
regarding
my
attendance
.
I
have
n’t
attended
lectures
in
almost
3
weeks
as
I
’m
finding
the
transition
into
uni
extremely
difficult
,
I
suffer
from
flu
and
I
seriously
struggle
to
adjust
to
change
and
fit
into
new
places
.
I
’ve
come
back
to
New
York
City
for
2
weeks
to
spend
some
time
with
family
and
sort
myself
out
.
I
am
up
to
date
on
all
work
as
I
have
caught
up
from

have
been
doing
my

tests
for
each
module
.
I
will
be
back

Hi
sir
,
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
emailing
in
regards
to
the
essay
I
am
writing
about
New
Labour
.
I
recall
you
asking
for
a
literature
review
in
one
of
our
seminars
and
am
slightly
confused
about
something
.
When
writing
my
essay
,
should
I
write
it
as
if
it
is
a
research
project
?
I
have
spoken
to
other
classmates
however
they
have
written
standard
essays
with
no
inclusion
of
motivation
and
aims
in
their
introductions
and
just
wanted
to
confirm
with
you
which
was
the
correct
way
.
Thank
you
for
your
time

My
paper

with
my

I

I
just
forgot

.
I
'm
talking
about
the
submission

2909
,
module
Thank
you
loads
for
the
reassurance
,
I
just
wish
to
know
if
the
submission
has
come
through
due
to
not
receiving
a
system
receipt
,
my
candidate
number
is
5327
and
my
student
ID
is
5105
.
Thank

I

will
I
encounter
any

because
of
this
?
I

I

it
says
"

and
that
is
the
case
here
,
the
submission
link
is
no
longer
available
therefore
I
am
unable
to
retrieve
the
submission
receipt
.
.
The
submit
bar
which
is
usually
at
the
bottom
is
no
longer
there
so
it
does
n’t
come
up
for
me
on
any
module
How
do
I
obtain

I

My
name

.
,
here
’s
a
copy
of
my
CV
!
I
have
n’t
done
a
full
blown
cover
letter
yet
but
I
did
apply
to
a
business
placement
in
August
,
which
I
just
found
out
was
unsuccessful
unfortunately
but
did
n’t
have
to
do
a
cover
letter
for
it
,
just
a
series
of
questions
and
I
could
email
you
a

I
responded

Hi
Colline
,
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
review
my
cv
,
I
really
appreciate
it
.
I
’ve
made
the
amendments
required
and
here
it
is
.
I
applied
to
a
business
placement
and
have
now
been
invited
for
a
digital
interview
.
If
it
’s
okay
I
’d
like
to
send
you
some
sample
answers
to
some
of
the
questions
for
you
to
review
.
I
have
n’t
actually
attempted
cover
letters
yet
as
business
's
questions
were
very
role
-
specific
.
I
have
been
looking
for
political
and
economicfinance
related
placements
but
I
’m
not
too
picky
on
what
I
end
up
with
.
Could
you
let
me
know
which
hours
you
are
available
so
I
could
book
an
appointment
with
you
please
?
I
really
do
appreciate
your
help
.
Kind

Hi
Carroll
,
Thank
you
for
your
response
,
apologies
I
did
n't
attach
my
cv
but
here
it
is
.
The
positions
at
business
have
closed
but
I
am
now
doing
my
business
placement
application
.
The
placement
application
is
asking
me
for
my
references
,
do
I
need
to
get
in
touch
with
old
employers
and
sixth
form
teachers
in
order
to
gain
their
details
so
that
I
can
note
them
down
in
the
references
section
?
I
am
unsure
of
how
this
works
.
Also
,
they
've
asked
me
to
write
out
a
personal
summary
,
regarding
my
key
skills
and
achievements
,
roles
I
've
held
and
a
separate
box
for
interests
and
hobbies
.
They
have
not
provided
a
word
limit
,
but
I
am
unsure
as
to
how
much
to
write
,
and
what
type
of
things
they
are
interested
in
reading
about
.
Thank
you
again
,

Hi
Henryetta
,
I
hope
you
're
well
.
I
have
double
-
checked
the
placement
agreement
form
as
stated
below
which
seems
to
be
fine
so
I
uploaded
it
again
to
system
,
however
,
I
have
been
asked
from
organisation
for
a
job
description
for
my
placement
?
Not
entirely
sure
though
as
there
is
a
job
description
listed
within
the
contractual
document
also
?
Thank
you

Hi
Geoff
,
I
hope
you
are
well
and
in
the
best
of
health
.
Apologies
for
not
emailing
around
the
end
of
October
like
intended
,
I
've
just
started
my
new
full
-
time
job
so
I
have
been
caught
up
in
the
training
sessions
online
and
getting
the
hang
of
it
!
I
was
wondering
if
we
could
schedule
a
meeting
possibly
next
week
,
depending
on
what
time
and
day
suits
you
best
.
Perhaps
we
could
look
at
assessment
centres
?
I
feel
quite
confident
with
interviews
now
with
the
work
we
have
done
.
Thank
you
and
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
.
Kind

Hi

Hi
Geri
,
It
's
okay
!
It
suddenly
cut
off
and
I
could
n't
see
or
hear
you
.
I
tried
to
type
in
the
chatbox
but
it
would
n't
send
either
!
I
'll
think
about
some
objectives
in
time
for
another
meeting
in
a
few
weeks
definitely
.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
have
a
meeting
with
me
.
I
'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
my
Internet
or
yours
playing
up
but
I
'm
so
sorry
for
the
technical
issues
!
I
hope
you
have
a
great
weekend
.

Hi
Jemie
,
It
's
not
letting
me
join
on

A
message
pops
up
saying
I
can
not
join
as
it
's
too
early
to
the
scheduled
start
time
?
I
have
n't
used
Webex
before
so
I
'm
not

what
to
do
.

Ardith

I

Hi
Erika
,
I
hope
this
email
finds
you
well
.
Apologies
for
my
email
has
taken
a
while
to
reach
you
,
I
have
been
reflecting
on
the
mentorship
so
far
and
what
I
'd
like
to
do
next
.
Thank
you
firstly
for
the
incredible
interview
and
vacation
scheme
tipsadvice
,
that
have
been
beneficial
!
I
appreciate
you
taking
time
out
of
your
schedule
to
help
me
.
With
the
upcoming
application
cycle
,
I
do
think
it
will
be
slightly
more
competitive
this
year
due
to
the
coronavirus
affecting
this
year
's
cycle
of
students
.
Therefore
,
the
next
thing
we
could
focus
on
is
looking
at
my
applications
this
year
and
seeing
where
I
went
wrong
?
I
do
have
my
answers
to
business_descrs
'
application
questions
saved
on
my
laptop
,
so
maybe
we
can
start
there
?
I
look
forward
to
hearing
your
thoughts
.
Thank
you
.
Kind
regards

Hilbert
,
I

Many
thanks
for
your
email
and
I
'm
glad
you
enjoyed
my
promotional
video
for
the
organisation
.
Unfortunately
,
I
wo
n't
be
able
to
participate
in
the
professional
promotional
video
as
I
'd
like
to
,
as
I
have
had
a
close
family
death
recently
which
has
led
me
to
take
some
time
off
work
.
As
a
result
,
I
am
quite
behind
in
some
projects
at
the
moment
.
Thank
you
for
considering
me
for
the
opportunity
however
,
it
is
much
appreciated
.
Thank
you
and
have
a
great
week
ahead
!

Hi
Helsa
,
Thank
you
for
your
email
and
your
condolences
.
That
means
a
lot
to
me
.
I
am
available
around
that
time
in
October
so
I
am
happy
to
film
,
however
I
am
mainly
anxious
about
how
this
will
be
filmed
cautiously
and
carefully
with
social
distancing
amid
the
coronavirus
pandemic
.
I
have
n't
been
out
much
since
December
due
to
my
anxiety
towards
coronavirus
,
so
my
certainty
to
say
'
yes
'
relies
mainly
on
how
this
will
be
carried
out
rather
than
actually
being
in
the
promotional
video
,
as
I
am
happy
to
give
back
to
the
organisation
and
be
part
of
a
promotional
video
.
Kind
regards
,
.

I

extremely
sorry

any
inconvenience
that
this
will
cause
.
I
am
grateful
and

for
such
an
opportunity
as
I

always
,
honoured
to

I

with
you
for
the
need

a
diverse
representation
of
students
so
if
you
would
like
me
to
ask
other
students
,
please
do
let
me
know
and
I
'd
be
more
than
happy
to
help
.
Thank
you
and

again

sorry

Ur

I

u
yesterday
I
'll
get
it
The
parties
involved
;
Alder
Hey
Children
’s
NHS
Foundation
Trust
,
Mr
Thomas
Evans
,
Ms
Kate
James
and
Alfie
Evans
.
The
first
case
,
Alder
Hey
Children
’s
NHS
Foundation
Trust
v
Evans
,
was
in
the
Family
Division
of
the
High
Court
of
Justice
which
considers
‘
declarations
in
medical
treatment
cases
’
.
Alfie
was
‘
terminally
ill
with
a
severe
and
progressive
neurodegenerative
condition
’
with
‘
simply
no
prospect
of
recovery
’
.
Since
parties
were
unable
to
decide
the
terms
of
an
end
of
life
plan
,
it
was
decided
‘
the
matter
shall
be
listed
before
Hayden
J
’
.
Represented
by
Mr
Diamond
,
a
writ
of
‘
habeas
corpus
’
was
requested
to
‘
release
Alfie
from
his
hospital
bed
’
arguing
he
was
‘
unlawfully
detained
’
.
Two
submissions
were
argued
:
Alfie
had
the
right
to
discharge
himself
and
his
parents
were
entitled
to
take
him
to
Italy
.
Mr
Mylonas
argued
Alfie
is
in
hospital
‘
for
the
purposes
of
receiving
care
and
treatment
in
accordance
with
the
court
’s
order
’
therefore
his
liberty
is
not
deprived
.
This
can
be
supported
in
Ferreira
‘
a
person
is
not
being
deprived
of
their
liberty
where
they
are
receiving
treatment
and
are
physically
restricted
by
their
physical
infirmities
’
.
Furthermore
,
Hayden
J
stated
that
‘
habeas
corpus
applies
only
to
individuals
unlawfully
detained
or
whose
civil
liberties
have
been
compromised
in
some
way
’
,
therefore
the
application
was
‘
entirely
misconceived
’
as
not
applicable
to
Alfie
.
Whilst
the
Trust
’s
care
plan
had
approval
from
Alfie
’s
guardian
,
Mr
Evans
objected
against
the
plan
.
With
a
‘
viscerally
engaged
army
of
Facebook
supporters
’
,
it
can
be
said
Mr
Evans
wanted
what
he
felt
was
right
.
In
Gard
,
the
judge
stated
welfare
of
the
child
shall
be
the
paramount
consideration
in
any
question
concerning
the
upbringing
of
the
child
in
any
proceedings
.
This
is
‘
stronger
than
’
in
all
actions
concerning
children
,
the
best
interests
of
the
child
shall
be
a
primary
consideration
.
Although
the
1989
Children
’s
Act
allows
parents
to
make
decisions
about
medical
treatment
where
the
child
can
not
consent
,
if
the
child
is
at
risk
of
harm
,
such
as
in
the
present
case
,
the
state
can
intervene
.
The
Christian
Legal
Centre
argued
‘
by
preventing
further
treatment
of
Alfie
,
Alder
Hey
and
the
courts
are
compelling
Alfie
to
die
’
.
Treloar
argued
‘
removal
of
parental
authority
as
a
result
of
referral
to
the
High
Court
is
wrong
,
and
deeply
unjust
’
.
Mr
Pavel
Stroilov
provided
a
letter
to
the
father
,
stating
‘
to
come
to
the
hospital
with
a
team
of
medical
professionals
with
their
own
life
support
equipment
and
move
Alfie
’
.
It
was
concluded
that
the
letter
was
misleading
as
false
advice
was
given
.
As
‘
Alfie
is
now
breathing
independently
’
,
Mr
Diamond
argued
on
behalf
of
the
father
,
‘
the
removal
of
the
ventilator
and
his
Italian
citizenship
are
changes
of
events
justifying
a
reconsideration
’
.
Whereas
,
Mr
Jason
Coppel
on
behalf
of
the
mother
,
argued
‘
it
is
a
fundamental
right
under
EU
law
to
access
services
in
any
other
member
state
’
therefore
Alfie
is
obliged
to
free
movement
within
the
European
Union
.
However
,
the
judge
ruled
allowing
him
to
travel
is
‘
fundamentally
against
the
core
principle
’
of
the
court
.
Although
the
public
are
surprised
that
Alfie
is
breathing
,
‘
it
is
not
a
surprise
to
the
doctors
who
deal
with
individuals
from
whom
treatment
is
withdrawn
’
.
The
ratio
decidendi
held
there
was
no
significant
change
,
therefore
the
application
had
no
substance
.
Only
relevant
consideration
were
Alfie
’s
best
interests
,
and
the
impact
was
‘
not
a
matter
that
the
court
could
take
into
account
’
.
The
habeas
corpus
was
used
as
a
tool
to
argue
for
the
same
outcome
,
but
it
does
not
change
the
fact
that
the
‘
parents
’
views
were
not
determinative
’
.
Therefore
,
the
permission
to
appeal
was
refused
.
With
a
global
awareness
of
the
case
,
Sir
David
Henshaw
said
,
‘
staff
have
endured
a
"
barrage
"
of
abuse
’
.
The
tensions
resulted
into
‘
aggressive
demonstrations
outside
the
hospital
,
and
threats
of
the
hospital
being
stormed
resulted
in
police
intervention
’
.
Campaigners
now
support
Charlie
’s
Law
and
Alfie
’s
Law
,
arguing
parents
need
better
rights
in
the
law
regarding
medical
decisions
.
The
case
,
Smith
,
was
heard
in
the
Courts
Martial
Appeal
Court
on
25th
March
1959
.
The
defendant
,
a
private
soldier
named
Thomas
Joseph
Smith
,
stabbed
three
of
his
comrades
during
a
fight
,
with
a
bayonet
in
the
army
regiment
barracks
.
One
individual
had
two
bayonet
wounds
which
‘
pierced
a
lung
and
caused
a
haemorrhage
’
.
On
his
way
to
the
medical
reception
,
the
victim
was
dropped
twice
.
Moreover
,
he
then
received
incorrect
medical
treatment
,
and
was
negligently
treated
by
the
medical
staff
who
failed
to
diagnose
the
puncture
.
The
victim
died
,
leading
the
defendant
to
be
convicted
with
murder
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
,
in
relevance
to
s.1
Offences
Against
the
Person
Act
1861
.
The
regimental
sergeant
-
major
‘
put
his
company
on
parade
’
after
the
fight
,
detaining
them
until
someone
confessed
.
Smith
,
as
a
result
,
admitted
to
the
stabbing
at
the
parade
.
The
following
day
,
Smith
was
visited
by
a
sergeant
from
the
Special
Investigations
Branch
who
administered
a
caution
and
requested
for
a
written
admission
.
Both
statements
were
given
as
evidence
at
the
trial
.
The
issue
lies
in
the
argument
of
who
is
liable
for
the
death
of
the
victim
,
whether
it
was
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
doctor
or
the
defendant
’s
actions
of
stabbing
the
victim
in
the
army
barracks
.
The
relevant
law
for
murder
is
actus
reus
,
which
is
unlawful
killing
,
and
mens
rea
,
which
is
the
intention
to
kill
or
cause
GBH
.
The
defendant
satisfies
both
,
as
his
act
of
stabbing
the
victim
led
to
the
consequence
of
his
death
Medical
Act
1983
states
if
a
fully
registered
person
is
judged
by
the
Professional
Conduct
Committee
to
have
been
guilty
of
serious
professional
misconduct
while
registered
or
not
,
the
Committee
may
direct
that
his
name
shall
be
erased
from
the
register
,
which
the
medical
staff
are
faced
with
in
this
case
.
With
such
a
severe
consequence
,
it
can
be
argued
that
the
medical
staff
ensured
they
were
accurate
in
their
actions
to
uphold
professional
conduct
.
Furthermore
,
the
action
of
the
third
party
involved
,
the
medical
staff
,
performed
a
reasonable
response
to
the
defendant
’s
original
act
.
Despite
reducing
chances
of
recovery
,
it
is
argued
that
their
act
did
not
break
the
chain
of
causation
because
it
was
not
‘
free
,
voluntary
and
informed
’
,
as
said
in
Pagett
.
In
Cheshire
,
the
defendant
‘
shot
the
victim
in
the
thigh
and
stomach
,
the
wounds
necessitated
surgery
from
which
he
developed
breathing
difficulties
’
,
for
which
he
had
to
have
tracheotomy
.
Due
to
rare
complications
in
surgery
,
the
victim
died
.
Although
,
the
‘
complication
was
a
direct
consequence
of
the
appellant
’s
acts
which
remained
a
significant
cause
’
to
the
death
of
the
victim
,
it
was
concluded
,
using
precedents
from
the
case
of
R
v
Smith
,
that
there
was
no
break
in
the
chain
of
causation
.
The
judge
told
the
jury
that
if
they
find
the
chain
of
causation
to
be
broken
,
they
must
believe
that
‘
the
medical
treatment
or
lack
of
it
was
reckless
in
the
sense
that
those
administering
it
were
careless
of
the
consequences
’
.
It
was
concluded
that
the
defendant
’s
actions
were
still
an
operating
and
substantial
cause
of
the
victim
’s
death
,
therefore
the
appeal
was
dismissed
.
This
differs
to
Jordan
where
the
victim
was
given
antibiotics
to
deal
with
stab
wounds
,
however
he
had
an
allergic
reaction
due
to
the
doctor
’s
misconduct
of
not
thoroughly
checking
records
,
and
he
died
.
The
court
,
in
this
case
,
concluded
that
the
defendant
’s
actions
did
satisfy
novus
actus
interviens
,
so
the
chain
of
causation
was
broken
.
Byrne
J
,
stated
that
the
death
was
not
‘
consequent
upon
the
wound
inflicted
’
,
but
for
the
actions
of
the
defendant
.
In
the
present
case
,
the
court
concluded
the
encountered
negligence
received
does
not
break
the
chain
of
causation
,
and
it
is
the
fault
of
the
defendant
for
the
victim
’s
death
.
Lord
Parker
CJ
,
one
of
the
three
judges
of
the
case
,
stated
that
the
action
undertaken
by
the
sergeant
-
major
was
appropriate
.
While
what
was
said
by
the
regimental
sergeant
-
major
was
a
threat
,
it
assisted
to
provide
further
information
for
inquiries
to
be
made
.
He
stated
that
an
individual
’s
confession
beyond
the
court
is
solely
admissible
if
voluntary
,
therefore
Smith
’s
first
admission
can
not
be
acceptable
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
second
statement
is
admissible
as
‘
it
is
clear
that
the
effect
of
any
original
inducement
or
threat
under
which
the
first
statement
was
made
had
been
dissipated
’
.
Furthermore
,
when
the
second
confession
was
made
,
the
circumstances
were
different
such
as
the
passing
of
nine
hours
,
the
parade
had
ended
,
and
the
threat
was
spent
.
The
change
in
circumstances
alters
the
validity
of
the
admissions
therefore
it
is
acceptable
for
the
second
confession
to
be
addressed
as
admissible
.
According
to
Lord
Parker
CJ
,
‘
if
at
the
time
of
death
,
the
original
wound
is
still
an
operating
cause
and
a
substantial
cause
,
then
the
death
can
properly
be
said
to
be
the
result
of
the
wound
,
albeit
that
some
other
cause
of
death
is
also
operating
’
.
It
could
not
be
due
to
the
medical
negligence
faced
,
as
‘
an
original
wounding
is
the
only
reason
that
treatment
and
presence
in
a
hospital
would
be
required
’
.
Based
on
this
,
it
can
be
disputed
that
despite
the
series
of
unfortunate
events
after
the
stabbing
,
the
death
only
occurred
due
to
the
original
stabbing
from
Smith
,
so
the
‘
wound
was
still
an
operating
cause
and
a
substantial
cause
of
death
’
.
The
victim
would
not
be
in
hospital
but
for
the
stabbing
,
so
it
would
be
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
stabbing
was
the
reason
for
his
death
,
satisfying
factual
causation
.
This
principle
upheld
the
conviction
,
and
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
.
Valerie
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
Just
to
let
you
know
that
the
organisation
team
have
got
back
to

now
and
they
have
asked
for
a

signature
whether
that
is
written

an

as
I
will
need
to
upload

Thank
you

Hi
Thorndike
,
I
've
looked
at

document
settings
and
as
it
is

,
myself
and
the

are
unable
to
add

and
signature
.
Could
an
unprotected
version
of
the
document
be
sent
to
me
?
Thank
you
.
Kind
regards
,
.
Yes
,
I
get
the
same
thing
too-
I
ca
n't
add
any
of
my
details
or
online
signature
.
I
've
checked
the
document
settings
and
it
turns
out
that
the
document
is
protected
so
we
are
unable
to
add
anything
else
.
I
've
asked
organisation
to
send
me
an
unprotected
version
of
the
document
so
hopefully
if
they
do
,
it
works
!
Thanks

I
have
a
few
questions
in
relation

I
was
hoping
you
could
answer
if
possible

On

it
states
that
the
word
limit
has
been
set
at
1250
words
with
a
time
expectation
of
1
hour
.
Is
that
a
time
you
expect
the
exam
can
be
done
within
or
is
that
a
time
limit
we
have
from
the
moment
we
click
the
access
link
within
the
24
hour
limit
?
Within
Section
A
,
are
the
MCQs
now
only
25
questions
alongside
the
SAQs
in
the
same
section
or
is
it
part
of
Section
B
?
I
am
a
bit
confused
what
Section
B

of

Thank

I

Hi

I
hope
you
and

are
well
!
I
just
wanted
to
drop
a
quick
email
to
recommend
a
series
I
have
been
watching
called
Patriot
Act
with
Hasan
Minhaj
on
Netflix
-
it
's
really
funny
and
entertaining
on
political
topics
!
I
'm
not
sure
if
you
've
heard
of
it
or
watched
it
before
but
perhaps
if
you
find
some
spare
time
,
you
could
give
it
a
go
?
I
'd
be
happy
to
know
what
you
think
of
it
!
Thanks

Hi
organisation
team
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
Having
recently
been
in
contact
with
the
team
,
I
received
a
form
that
was
required
to
be
filled
by
myself
and
the
employer
-
mine
being
the
organisation
.
I
sent
the
form
to
the
relevant
staff
member
in
the
organisation
who
have
completed
the
form
but
struggled
to
sign
the
online
email
signature
.
They
have
asked
if
the
completed
form
is
enough
or
if
not
,
whether
it
is
possible
for
an
email
from
them
to
be
sent
and
will
be
enough
as
the
organisation
office
is
closed
at
the
moment
.
I
have
attached
the
form
for
your
reference
.
Thank
you
.

Dear
SirMadam
,
On
the
3003
June
I
lost
my
student
card
and
as
a
result
of
external
financial
circumstances
I
was
unable
to
buy
a
new
one
as
I
had
already
a
previous
one
.
I
spoke
to
2
of
my
lecturers
and
let
them
know
and
they
said
it
would
not
be
an
issue
to
speak
with
the
attendance
team
if
it
needs
to
happen
.
Today
I
am
finally
able
to
buy
a
new
student
card
.
I
have
been
attending
all
my
lectures
except
this
week
I
have
not
attended
any
.
I
hope
you
are
able
to
understand
my
situation
and
I
would
really
not
like
my
attendance
to
be
negatively
affected
.
Thank
you
.
Hi
,
Many
apologies

I

Hi
Honey
,
I
have
been
trying
to
complete
the
online
questionnaire
today
however
its
been
showing
the
same
message
.
I
tried
at
mid
day
and
then
tried
again
just
now
and
it
's
saying
that
the
surgery
is
not
active
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
this
is
because
of
my
computer
as
I
did
try
on
my
phone
as
well
.
Really
sorry
about
this
,
are
you
able
to
send
me
a
different
link
?
Kind
regards
.
Hi
Basia
,
I
hope
you
are
.
As
a
result
of
the
current
pandemic
and
it
’s
not
effect
on
my
family
during
the
time
where
I
had
to
do
my
assignments
I
was
not
able
to
do
so
.
After
speaking
with
my
family
I
had
to
decide
to
defer
my
assignments
for
the
Summer
Board
.
However
,
I
was
wondering
if
you
could
help
me
understand
what
this
means
for
your
module
,
especially
my
topic
essay
which
I
was
n’t
able
to
submit
.
Kind

.
Dear

deferred
assignments
by

August
deadlines

uni

I

but

my
masters
course
Comprehending
behaviour
has
been
a
motive
for
psychologists
and
they
have
perspectives
which
explain
human
behaviour
.
I
intend
to
discuss
the
psychoanalytic
and
biological
perspective
.
The
biological
perspective
focuses
on
the
nature
within
the
nature
vs
nurture
debate
.
The
debate
is
the
question
whether
our
behaviour
as
humans
is
predetermined
by
genetics
or
is
governed
by
our
environment
A
difference
between
the
approaches
is
that
the
psychoanalytic
is
not
scientific
whereas
the
biological
is
a
scientifically
credible
approach
as
it
uses
scientific
ways
of
measurement
;
collecting
data
which
empirical
e.g
through
brain
scanning
techniques
this
means
measurements
are
objective
.
Studies
are
conducted
in
controlled
lab
settings
which
are
replicable
and
reliable
,
as
a
result
this
makes
the
approach
a
nomothetic
as
the
results
can
be
generalised
and
laws
can
be
made
from
results
.
In
contrast
the
psychoanalytic
approach
is
not
falsifiable
.
Freud
’s
assumptions
can
not
be
proved
wrong
,
as
they
can
not
be
scientifically
tested
or
measured
.
This
results
in
the
psychoanalytic
perspective
being
idiographic
as
there
’s
emphasis
on
one
’s
personal
experience
he
also
focused
on
case
studies
meaning
results
ca
n’t
be
generationalised
to
produce
laws
as
they
’re
too
subjective
.
To
summarize
,
both
perspectives
are
deterministic
;
the
biological
suggesting
human
behaviour
is
a
result
of
our
genetics
,
brain
physiology
and
neuro
chemistry
therefore
we
have
no
free
will
.
The
psychoanalytical
suggests
behaviour
is
a
consequence
of
upbringing
as
the
psych
is
completely
developed
by
six
years
of
age
,
so
both
do
not
take
into
account
the
role
of
free
will
.
Furthermore
,
the
two
perspectives
continue
to
impact
society
in
a
positive
way
improving
understanding
of
behaviour
.
Dear
Felicio
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
made
a
bad
mistake
when
uploading
my
module
exam
yesterday
,
I
uploaded
an
unfinished
and
unedited
piece
of
work
,
I
believe
I
could
have
corrected
it
but
as
I
’m
in
Brazil
the
Internet
is
only
working
intermittently
.
I
have
tried
to
resubmit
on
system
but
it
’s
not
working
,
I
’m
not
quite
sure
what
step
to
take
but
I
have
attached
the
document
to
you
just
in
case
.
I
understand
I
would
have
lost
10
%
immediately
because
it
is
late
.

1.Outline
the
proposed
role
of
dopamine
in
the
maintenance
of
drug
use
Dopamine
,
a
neurotransmitter
that
is
associated
with
pleasure
and
reward
,
eating
,
drinking
and
sex
are
examples
of
reward
process
that
stimulate
dopamine
production
.
In
evolutionary
terms
dopamine
naturally
encourages
behaviour
that
is
vital
to
live
such
as
eating
when
one
is
hungry
.
The
nucleus
accumbens
and
the
ventral
tegmental
area
are
important
areas
in
the
brain
associated
with
production
of
dopamine

Employment
relations
is
a
process
of
socio
-
economic
exchange
,
and
involves
a
individual
performing
service
or
duty
in
exchange
for
payment
.
Employment
relations
looks
at
the
different
aspects
of
a
relationship
between
an
employee
and
its
employer
.
Employment
relations
have
a
major
impact
on
the
UK
labour
market
,
this
statement
is
supported
by
ONS
report
on
the
UK
labour
market
which
shows
from
November
2017
,
there
are
approximately
32
million
people
at
work
with
more
than
half
being
employed
.
The
UK
government
is
crucial
with
regards
to
employment
relations
to
ensure
they
are
able
to
meet
the
key
goals
of
the
country
.
The
government
acts
as
the
economic
manager
,
this
consist
of
setting
the
level
of
wages
,
tax
rate
and
managing
the
cost
of
living
.
The
government
are
also
classed
as
regulators
of
labour
markets
,
this
involves
initiating
new
laws
and
regulations
that
have
an
impact
upon
the
relationship
between
employer
and
employee
.
In
addition
,
they
play
act
as
the
welfare
state
,
ensuring
they
are
able
to
aid
those
who
have
been
made
redundant
or
struggling
with
financial
difficulties
.
Being
the
largest
employer
with
5.39
million
workers
employed
,
the
government
sees
itself
as
a
eloquent
employer
and
wants
to
show
private
sectors
how
to
do
this
.
This
report
will
look
the
role
the
government
plays
with
regards
to
gender
equality
in
the
UK
.
There
has
been
an
improvement
in
the
amount
of
females
in
the
labour
market
.
Since
the
beginning
,
there
has
always
been
more
men
employed
them
women
.
The
office
of
national
statistics
shows
during
the
third
quarter
of
2020
,
78.6
%
of
men
were
employed
opposed
to
the
71.9
%
of
women
who
have
been
employed
,
a
difference
of
just
under
7
%
,
this
is
near
enough
the
lowest
the
difference
has
ever
been
and
is
a
huge
improvement
considering
the
gap
was
11.5
%
ten
years
ago
.
These
numbers
have
however
been
affected
heavily
by
the
covid-19
pandemic
.
The
employment
rates
of
males
has
remained
around
70
%
,
however
females
have
increased
immensely
.
Since
the
great
recession
in
2008
in
which
women
employment
was
roughly
67
%
,
women
employment
has
increased
by
around
5
%
.
ONS
suggests
that
women
employment
was
at
an
all
time
high
in
the
first
quarter
of
2020
before
the
pandemic
of
72.6
%
,
showing
a
positive
change
from
52.8
%
in
1971
.
The
changes
in
state
pension
age
for
women
has
had
a
slight
impact
on
this
increase
meaning
less
females
retiring
between
the
ages
of
60
-
65
.
This
increase
in
the
number
of
women
in
the
labour
market
has
initiated
a
positive
attitude
towards
the
support
of
gender
equality
.
There
are
several
reasons
for
the
growth
in
numbers
of
females
in
the
workforce
,
one
huge
reason
is
the
government
acting
as
regulators
of
labour
markets
and
initiating
laws
,
these
laws
include
the
lone
parent
income
support
and
equality
act
2010
,
equality
and
human
right
commission
,
employment
act
2008
and
equality
act
2006
.
From
the
start
of
2008
to
2010
,
male
employment
rate
went
down
by
4
%
,
whereas
for
females
just
under
2
%
due
to
so
many
being
made
redundant
.
The
years
following
the
UK
recession
saw
a
loss
in
numbers
of
female
full
time
workers
,
but
an
improvement
in
the
number
of
part
time
employees
.
Fortunately
,
since
the
end
of
2012
the
full
time
employment
has
grown
.
During
recession
,
many
organisations
recruited
part
time
workers
and
full
time
workers
were
made
redundant
to
help
with
labour
costs
and
still
have
the
same
productivity
from
employees
.
This
process
is
referred
to
as
labour
market
flexibility
,
,
however
there
are
still
millions
who
earn
less
than
the
real
living
wage
.
Therefore
the
government
need
to
implement
new
strategies
to
tackle
this
.
The
positions
of
more
authority
within
organisations
still
have
majority
of
men
as
the
employees
,
the
government
should
encourage
females
to
apply
for
these
higher
positions
by
showing
other
women
who
have
been
able
to
become
employees
of
these
top
positions
,
this
could
be
used
as
motivation
for
females
to
feel
that
they
are
also
able
to
achieve
these
roles
.
It
is
vital
that
the
skills
and
potential
of
women
in
the
UK
are
used
to
a
maximum
,
as
mentioned
previously
if
the
UK
were
able
to
reach
the
same
female
employment
rate
as
Sweden
,
it
would
increase
the
GDP
by
$
252
billion
,
which
would
help
decrease
the
gender
pay
gap
and
boost
the
economy
significantly
.
This
shows
if
the
UK
government
are
able
to
fulfil
their
roles
efficiently
as
the
biggest
employers
,
and
regulators
of
labour
market
,
they
could
definitely
help
with
gender
inequality
in
the
UK

In
brief
,
I
have
mentioned
how
the
celebrities
used
are
popular
and
have
good
reputation
with
being
nominated
for
awards
in
their
own
fields
,
also
how
the
campaign
consists
of
celebrities
enjoying
the
Christmas
atmosphere
together
whilst
wearing
business
products
,
sharing
positivity
fulfilling
the
psychological
needs
of
belongingness
and
esteem
needs
.
Also
,
the
campaign
consists
of
them
coming
to
life
and
showing
off
their
professions
in
business
clothing
has
a
influence
on
consumer
behaviour
.
My
thoughts
for
recommendations
were
maybe
they
could
use
celebrities
of
a
wider
background
to
show
diversity
and
influence
a
wider
audience
,
and
maybe
use
celebrities
that
are
not
only
football
stars
and
singers
.
Hi
Shamus
,
I
am
using
the
event
,
I
think
it
is
a
really
good
campaign
,
uses
celebrity
endorsement
,
good
length
.
Could
you
give
me
some
tips
for
the
recommendations
for
this
ad
if
possible
?

This
essay
will
focus
on
how
well
FIFA
have
responded
to
the
2015
corruption
scandal
and
an
in
-
depth
look
into
the
measures
they
have
since
taken
to
prevent
bribery
being
used
within
FIFA
.
By
looking
at
different
views
and
academic
disciplines
to
critically
evaluate
if
FIFA
have
done
enough
to
prevent
corruption
and
bribery
continuing
within
their
organisation
.
Background
:
FIFA
,
an
organisation
people
all
over
the
world
are
familiar
with
.
In
2002
213
countries
broadcast
the
FIFA
world
cup
making
it
the
most
watched
event
in
television
history
.
The
reach
and
influence
FIFA
has
is
vast
.
FIFA
is
a
non
-
profit
organisation
which
describes
itself
as
the
international
governing
body
of
association
football
.
FIFA
was
established
in
1904
by
7
different
nations
.
The
global
network
and
sensation
surrounding
FIFA
Led
them
to
generating
$
4.6
billion
in
2018
.
In
2015
an
investigation
by
the
United
States
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
documentary
about
the
corruption
and
the
World
Cup
this
led
to
the
FBI
contacting
Jennings
.
Since
then
more
and
more
information
from
investigators
and
whistle
-
blowers
has
come
to
light
about
bribes
and
corruption
going
on
within
FIFA
mainly
regarding
World
Cup
’s
and
where
they
will
be
held
.
Countries
were
bribing
FIFA
officials
to
accept
their
bid
for
the
World
Cup
to
be
held
in
their
country
.
The
investigation
has
found
out
that
there
was
bribery
involved
in
Qatar
’s
successful
bid
for
the
2022
World
Cup
.
In
December
2014
FIFA
had
conducted
their
own
investigation
into
the
allegations
of
corruption
however
they
did
not
release
the
findings
of
this
investigation
but
just
an
executive
summary
.
In
which
they
claimed
to
have
exonerated
the
bidding
process
of
corruption
.
This
decision
shows
that
in
2014
they
were
not
willing
to
make
any
major
changes
or
take
responsibility
for
the
corruption
and
bribery
that
took
place
.
These
actions
could
show
FIFAs
unwillingness
to
change
these
practices
and
shows
in
the
future
it
will
still
be
standard
practice
for
FIFA
to
take
bribes
.
2022
World
Cup
:
There
are
many
arguments
surrounding
the
FIFA
scandal
some
people
argue
that
Qatar
should
not
be
allowed
to
host
the
2022
World
Cup
as
it
effectively
rewards
their
actions
and
involvement
in
the
corruption
.
There
are
arguments
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
allow
a
controversial
state
to
host
the
World
Cup
and
have
such
a
large
platform
.
The
fact
that
this
corruption
harms
so
many
people
it
breaches
the
ethics
of
virtues
.
There
are
already
red
flags
being
raised
about
the
2022
World
Cup
and
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
it
will
be
held
in
the
winter
due
to
the
temperatures
in
the
summer
in
the
middle
east
.
Anti
-
corruption
expert
Sylvia
Schenk
believes
that
if
there
was
a
legal
dispute
regarding
this
it
would
not
be
resolved
until
at
least
2028
at
which
point
it
is
ineffective
.
Between
the
scandal
in
2015
and
the
World
Cup
that
is
due
to
take
place
in
2022
there
have
been
many
years
and
many
different
chances
for
FIFA
officials
to
set
a
precedent
and
show
that
they
are
committed
to
stamping
the
corruption
out
of
FIFA
.
One
way
to
achieve
this
would
be
to
allow
another
country
to
host
the
2022
World
Cup
.
It
has
been
argued
that
this
would
not
be
too
difficult
as
many
countries
have
the
infrastructure
e.g.
,
stadiums
set
up
to
accommodate
the
World
Cup
therefore
logistics
should
not
be
an
issue
here
.
This
shows
that
FIFA
do
not
appear
to
have
taken
anything
away
from
the
scandal
and
try
and
change
for
the
better
.
Human
Rights
:
The
issues
regarding
the
2015
scandal
are
still
Widely
debated
2021
.
With
Qualifying
stages
of
the
2022
World
Cup
starting
players
have
been
protesting
the
allegations
of
human
rights
of
migrant
workers
being
breached
in
Qatar
due
to
host
the
2022
World
Cup
.
The
Guardian
revealed
in
February
2021
that
since
Qatar
won
the
bid
to
host
the
tournament
in
2010
over
6,500
migrant
workers
have
died
in
Qatar
.
However
,
this
shocking
statistic
could
be
misleading
it
is
impossible
to
know
how
many
of
these
deaths
are
related
to
human
rights
breaches
and
how
many
are
related
to
the
World
Cup
.
This
however
does
not
look
good
for
FIFA
or
Qatar
surrounding
this
global
event
especially
as
37
deaths
have
been
directly
linked
to
the
construction
of
the
stadiums
.
This
issue
that
is
gaining
global
traction
due
partly
to
Norway
who
on
the
24th
of
March
protested
by
wearing
T
-
shirts
during
the
warmup
which
read
"
human
rights
on
and
off
the
pitch
"
in
their
World
Cup
qualifying
match
.
Other
teams
have
started
to
follow
suit
by
wearing
T
-
shirts
raising
awareness
of
the
problem
.
Kimmich
has
argued
that
teams
are
10
years
too
late
to
boycott
.
The
damage
has
already
been
done
and
Qatar
have
been
allowed
to
get
away
with
this
for
far
too
long
protests
should
have
been
taking
place
when
Qatar
was
allocated
the
World
Cup
and
before
they
started
building
all
the
stadiums
.
However
,
The
German
football
Federation
is
not
in
favour
of
boycotting
the
World
Cup
.
So
,
all
the
T
-
shirt
wearing
in
the
world
will
not
help
the
migrant
workers
that
have
died
or
will
continue
to
die
for
this
World
Cup
or
others
to
come
.
This
is
yet
another
example
of
a
time
where
FIFA
have
sat
back
and
let
corruption
run
rife
within
its
organisation
six
years
after
the
corruption
scandal
this
therefore
shows
they
have
not
made
major
improvements
or
changes
to
stop
his
from
happening
for
many
more
years
to
come
.
Social
Responsibility
:
It
is
not
just
a
legal
field
that
believes
FIFA
are
problematic
.
It
is
argued
that
FIFA
are
also
corrupt
in
terms
of
their
corporate
social
responsibility
.
In
a
2014
study
it
was
found
that
corporations
and
companies
that
sponsored
FIFA
were
disliked
more
and
trusted
less
by
the
public
and
people
are
more
likely
to
negatively
talk
about
these
brands
with
their
peers
.
This
study
can
be
very
negative
for
FIFA
and
the
many
brands
that
pay
them
millions
in
sponsorship
.
This
could
cause
massive
problems
for
FIFA
in
the
future
if
corporations
and
brands
the
sponsor
that
events
decide
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
associated
any
more
.
This
is
one
example
of
how
the
corruption
scandal
has
negatively
impacted
FIFA
is
brand
and
therefore
value
.
Therefore
,
correcting
and
changing
this
public
perception
will
be
crucial
to
FIFAs
continued
success
.
Feminist
Perspective
:
There
is
also
a
view
that
FIFA
is
a
"
boys
club
"
.
Professional
tennis
player
Billie
Jean
King
has
tried
to
advocate
for
FIFA
to
hire
more
female
managers
and
to
appoint
more
females
into
higher
roles
within
the
company
and
hire
someone
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
gender
equality
within
the
company
.
She
also
raises
a
point
that
having
more
women
within
FIFA
could
improve
the
culture
of
corruption
that
exists
.
There
have
been
studies
that
show
that
women
are
less
likely
to
be
involved
in
bribery
and
are
less
likely
to
condone
bribe
taking
.
Data
from
different
countries
shows
that
corruption
is
less
severe
where
women
held
more
seats
in
parliament
or
more
senior
positions
and
comprise
of
a
larger
share
of
the
labour
force
.
Therefore
,
viewing
this
issue
from
the
feminist
perspective
one
way
FIFA
could
counter
some
corruption
could
be
to
employ
women
in
more
positions
and
in
more
senior
roles
.
However
,
it
could
be
argued
that
this
is
less
of
a
gender
difference
and
more
of
a
culturally
based
issue
in
however
due
to
the
global
nature
of
FIFA
this
could
potentially
make
a
difference
.
The
fact
that
some
of
these
issues
were
raised
years
ago
and
have
not
been
acted
upon
shows
once
again
that
FIFA
are
not
dedicated
to
eradicating
corruption
.
Legalities
:
FIFA
is
registered
and
incorporated
under
swiss
law
.
It
is
a
very
attractive
base
for
many
international
organisations
not
only
due
to
its
location
and
political
stability
Switzerland
also
has
most
importantly
a
very
lenient
legal
code
and
attractive
tax
regime
.
This
could
be
one
of
the
reasons
that
attracted
FIFA
to
incorporate
itself
there
.
Switzerland
is
perceived
to
be
a
country
that
is
least
affected
by
corruption
however
this
does
not
prevent
organisations
that
are
located
there
being
involved
in
corruption
.
Article
332
of
the
Swiss
criminal
code
only
refers
to
the
bribery
of
a
public
official
as
criminal
therefore
there
is
no
criminal
liability
for
the
bribery
of
officials
in
international
sports
organisations
such
as
FIFA
.
It
could
be
argued
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
corruption
and
bribery
has
run
rampant
within
FIFA
for
so
many
years
.
It
could
be
argued
that
under
the
Swiss
federal
act
on
unfair
competition
the
type
of
bribery
happening
within
FIFA
could
be
criminally
prosecuted
.
However
transparency
International
believe
that
it
is
unclear
whether
this
would
be
applicable
to
sport
and
FIFA
.
In
2004
the
Federal
Council
ruled
that
this
article
did
not
apply
to
non
-
governmental
organisations
e.g.
FIFA
.
There
have
been
moves
made
by
the
Swiss
Parliament
to
change
the
law
so
that
Bribery
that
does
not
involve
public
officials
can
be
criminally
charged
.
This
was
following
a
recommendation
from
GRECO
.
This
accountability
should
prevent
more
bribes
taking
place
within
FIFA
.
Geography
:
The
sheer
scale
and
vast
geography
that
FIFA
covers
could
be
one
of
the
main
enablers
in
the
corruption
and
bribery
that
takes
place
.
Although
FIFA
is
covered
by
Swiss
law
the
majority
of
the
crimes
did
not
take
place
in
Switzerland
this
creates
a
situation
where
it
is
impossible
for
one
country
to
be
able
to
keep
track
and
punish
such
a
large
organisation
.
FIFA
is
a
billion
-
pound
empire
that
effectively
has
the
ability
to
punish
countries
this
makes
them
untouchable
.
This
system
negatively
affects
smaller
and
poorer
countries
.
Morocco
was
also
competing
for
the
2022
World
Cup
and
after
spending
millions
on
the
campaign
they
lost
out
to
Qatar
due
to
the
bribes
Qatar
paid
to
FIFA
officials
.
Currently
32
teams
and
subsequently
32
countries
play
in
the
World
Cup
,
FIFA
have
been
discussing
pushing
this
to
48
countries
.
Bringing
more
countries
in
to
the
World
Cup
could
potentially
reduce
corruption
and
bribery
as
that
is
more
accountability
and
even
more
countries
will
be
watching
them
.
However
,
this
could
go
the
other
way
and
now
there
are
16
more
countries
that
could
be
involved
in
bribery
.
When
Qatar
was
awarded
the
2022
World
Cup
they
denied
Morocco
the
chance
to
host
the
World
Cup
.
It
could
be
argued
that
Morocco
deserve
the
World
Cup
more
as
they
are
a
smaller
economy
and
the
World
Cup
would
have
benefited
them
more
than
Qatar
.
It
could
also
be
argued
that
after
the
bribery
Qatar
used
to
gain
the
world
cup
came
to
light
Morocco
should
have
been
awarded
the
World
Cup
.
There
has
been
talks
of
Spain
Portugal
and
Morocco
teaming
up
for
a
joint
bid
for
the
2030
World
Cup
however
Spain
and
Portugal
signed
a
joint
bid
agreement
and
left
Morocco
out
once
again
this
could
be
devastating
for
Morocco
’s
economy
.
There
have
been
studies
into
GDP
and
corruption
.
Qatar
’s
GDP
is
175.8
billion
c
compared
to
Morocco
’s
119.7
both
in
2019
.
The
study
indicates
that
the
poorer
country
the
more
likely
they
are
to
be
susceptible
to
corruption
however
in
this
example
that
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
as
based
on
GDP
Qatar
has
more
wealth
but
clearly
,
they
were
more
susceptible
to
bribery
.
Psychology
:
There
are
many
Psychological
theories
and
there
has
been
lots
of
research
completed
in
regards
to
bribery
and
corruption
.
One
of
the
main
theories
that
comes
from
psychological
studies
is
the
trust
game
.
This
was
first
created
by
Berg
et
al
the
results
from
the
study
were
surprising
and
went
against
the
standard
economic
theory
upon
which
they
were
based
.
The
theory
and
results
of
this
study
can
be
applied
to
FIFA
the
anonymity
and
scale
of
the
bribery
makes
it
easier
for
people
to
be
corrupted
as
there
is
a
level
of
anonymity
.
One
problem
with
this
theory
is
that
the
study
was
done
in
1995
on
a
very
small
population
therefore
the
results
can
not
be
generalised
to
modern
society
and
the
global
society
where
customs
cultures
and
values
vary
massively
.
Studies
like
this
one
tend
to
be
studied
by
white
men
and
study
white
men
therefore
there
is
massive
gender
and
racial
bias
involved
in
the
results
of
this
study
which
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
it
outside
of
the
context
of
a
single
study
.
Similar
studies
were
conducted
that
compared
data
from
many
different
countries
to
see
if
there
was
a
relationship
between
nationality
and
the
likelihood
to
take
or
condone
bribery
.
The
study
found
that
collectivism
versus
individualism
on
a
national
scale
was
the
fact
and
most
likely
to
affect
bribery
.
This
theory
seems
to
line
up
with
Qatar
as
it
has
a
very
large
wealth
divide
.
This
divide
makes
it
much
easier
for
people
to
take
part
in
bribes
.
In
1995
there
was
a
cross
national
study
focusing
on
ethics
this
study
found
that
there
was
substantial
crossover
between
personality
values
but
the
moral
reasoning
very
significantly
.
The
psychologists
use
social
cognitive
theory
to
explain
the
practical
implications
of
this
study
.
This
could
explain
why
some
countries
are
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
bribery
than
others
due
to
social
cognitive
theory
and
shared
values
of
a
society
.
There
are
many
different
areas
of
psychology
that
relate
directly
to
bribery
and
corruption
and
the
FIFA
scandal
.
These
theories
should
be
able
to
show
a
way
for
bribery
to
be
reduced
in
the
future
.
This
can
be
seen
using
the
evolutionary
psychology
principle
.
This
theory
states
that
there
are
distinct
patterns
of
corruption
that
can
be
seen
throughout
history
with
the
FIFA
2015
corruption
scandal
named
as
one
.
This
theory
explains
that
social
and
cultural
norms
have
evolved
over
time
to
allow
to
happen
more
freely
.
This
could
be
good
news
for
FIFA
as
it
could
explain
why
so
much
bribery
has
happened
within
the
organisation
and
it
could
help
reduce
their
blame
and
liability
for
the
bribery
.
This
theory
can
also
show
how
to
reduce
bribery
within
FIFA
in
the
future
.
Legal
Case
:
The
sheer
scale
and
vast
geography
that
FIFA
covers
could
be
one
of
the
main
enablers
in
the
corruption
and
bribery
that
takes
place
.
Although
FIFA
is
covered
by
Swiss
law
the
majority
of
the
crimes
did
not
take
place
in
Switzerland
this
creates
and
in
capability
of
anyone
to
be
able
to
keep
try
and
punish
such
a
large
organisation
.
FIFA
is
billion
-
pound
empire
that
effectively
has
the
ability
to
punish
countries
this
makes
them
untouchable
.
This
system
negatively

When
Qatar
was
awarded
the
2022
World
Cup
they
Denied
Moscow
the
chance
to
host
the
World
Cup
.
It
could
be
argued
that
Morocco
deserve
the
World
Cup
more
as
they
are
a
smaller
economy
and
the
World
Cup
would
have
benefited
them
more
than
guitar
.
It
could
also
be
argued
that
after
the
truck
in
time
like
Morocco
should
have
been
awarded
the
World
Cup
.
There
has
been
talks
of
Spain
Portugal
and

be
the
case
as
base
of
GDP
Qatar
has
more
wealth
but
clearly
,
they
were
more
susceptible
to
bribery
.
To
conclude
it
appears
that
FIFA
have
not
done
everything
in
their
power
to
prevent
further
corruption
happening
since
the
2015
scandal
.
However
,
it
is
a
very
large
and
complex
issue
that
covers
many
legal
and
political
jurisdictions
.
This
therefore
makes
it
very
hard
to
give
definitive
answer
to
how
well
FIFA
dealt
with
the
scandal
.
From
my
research
for
this
essay
,
I
have
come
across
many
recommendations
for
how
FIFA
could
reduce
bribery
and
corruption
from
so
many
different
academic
disciplines
and
the
fact
that
FIFA
has
not
implemented
any
of
the
shows
FIFA
has
not
learnt
from
2015
.
On
balance
it
appears
they
have
not
made
enough
changes
to
prevent
this
from
happening
again
.

Hello
thank
you
for
your
reply
it
is
much
appreciated
.
I
am
very
disappointed
that
this
problem
has
n’t
been
resolved
and
I
do
feel
let
down
by
the
customer
service
team
I
feel
the
tone
of
emails
I
received
were
not
up
to
the
usual
standard
.
I
appreciate
you
need
images
however
I
was
having
a
birthday
party
that
is
what
the
order
was
for
so
I
had
to
remove
the
box
of
broken
glass
from
my
kitchen
as
a
matter
of
health
and
safety
.
I
’m
sure
you
can
appreciate
in
the
stress
of
removing
this
and
trying
to
source
replacements
taking
images
did
n’t
enter
my
mind
until
it
was
too
late
and
the
box
was
buried
under
a
lot
of
other
rubbish
in
the
rubbish
room
used
by
hundreds
.

The
question
to
what
extent
to
which
English
Laws
general
hostility
towards
good
faith
in
commercial
contracts
is
justifiable
within
the
modern
day
has
been
subjected
to
disapproval
by
some
judges
.
In
Interfoto
Picture
Library
Ltd
v
Stiletto
Visual
Programmes
Ltd
Bingham
L.J.
noted
that
‘
in
many
legal
systems
outside
the
common
law
world
,
the
law
of
obligations
recognises
and
enforces
an
overriding
principle
that
in
making
and
carrying
out
contracts
parties
should
act
in
good
faith
’
but
English
law
has
decided
not
to
adopt
a
good
faith
obligation
but
rather
‘
developed
piecemeal
solutions
in
response
to
demonstrated
problems
of
unfairness
.
’
The
courts
in
England
are
more
concerned
with
commercial
certainty
rather
than
parties
being
just
towards
one
another
.
This
essay
will
argue
that
the
hostility
towards
good
faith
obligations
within
commercial
contracts
can
not
be
justified
in
the
modern
day
and
that
there
should
be
a
good
faith
principle
introduced
in
English
Law
.
It
will
begin
by
discussing
the
current
law
in
relation
to
good
faith
and
explain
how
an
overriding
principle
of
good
faith
will
be
beneficial
to
the
parties
in
commercial
contracts
.
It
will
then
suggest
the
reasons
why
in
this
day
and
age
it
is
important
for
there
to
be
an
obligation
of
good
faith
within
commercial
contracts
and
give
examples
of
the
English
law
’s
current
recognition
of
implied
and
express
good
faith
obligations
.
Finally
,
it
will
look
at
the
general
principles
of
the
UK
courts
such
as
party
autonomy
and
commercial
certainty
and
explore
how
they
can
still
be
preserved
with
an
obligation
of
good
faith
.
Good
faith
is
the
notion
that
those
within
contracts
will
act
fairly
towards
one
another
.
They
will
‘
put
all
their
cards
face
upwards
on
the
table
’
and
trade
in
a
way
that
is
open
and
fair
.
Traditionally
good
faith
is
not
an
overriding
principle
in
English
Law
as
the
courts
prefer
for
there
to
be
certainty
within
commercial
contracts
as
opposed
to
fairness
.
They
are
particularly
against
imposing
broad
good
faith
obligations
.
The
reasons
for
this
include
the
fact
that
it
can
cause
uncertainty
because
if
there
was
an
obligation
to
act
in
good
faith
this
can
sometimes
go
against
what
the
terms
of
the
contract
include
.
The
parties
can
usually
only
go
to
court
if
one
party
does
not
fulfil
their
end
of
the
contract
.
Furthermore
,
good
faith
can
be
seen
as
subjective
as
every
person
will
have
a
different
view
of
what
good
faith
is
and
sometimes
one
judge
may
go
too
far
and
start
siding
with
one
party
which
would
cause
the
other
party
a
loss
and
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
middle
point
where
it
is
suitable
for
both
parties
to
not
be
at
a
complete
loss
.
Another
reason
as
to
why
the
English
courts
prefer
not
to
have
a
good
faith
obligation
is
because
it
makes
them
a
lot
more
attractive
to
global
businesses
since
they
are
one
of
the
main
countries
without
a
good
faith
obligation
.
This
allows
for
those
wanting
to
get
into
commercial
contracts
to
be
more
certain
about
the
outcomes
if
anything
was
to
go
wrong
.
English
law
also
prefers
for
there
to
be
party
autonomy
as
it
allows
both
parties
to
be
able
to
choose
which
law
will
govern
their
contract
.
This
allows
for
an
enhanced
level
of
certainty
and
predictability
because
both
parties
will
be
able
to
choose
which
laws
best
suit
them
.
The
parties
also
have
freedom
of
contract
which
gives
each
party
the
freedom
to
enter
into
a
contract
and
decide
what
terms
to
include
.
Rather
than
an
actual
good
faith
principal
English
law
prefers
to
adopt
piecemeal
solutions
which
are
used
for
certain
situations
where
it
is
seen
as
necessary
.
These
will
usually
arise
in
fiduciary
relationships
,
contracts
of
insurance
and
contracts
of
partnerships
and
employment
.
These
include
contractual
interpretation
where
the
courts
will
look
at
the
intention
of
the
parties
rather
than
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
words
used
in
the
contract
.
Another
instance
where
the
courts
might
decide
to
use
piecemeal
solutions
is
when
an
unfair
act
amounts
to
promissory
estoppel
.
Misrepresentation
is
another
example
where
the
courts
might
use
piecemeal
solutions
.
In
some
contracts
such
as
ones
where
fiduciary
duties
are
assumed
there
is
a
duty
to
consider
the
other
party
’s
interests
.
The
party
assuming
the
fiduciary
duties
will
be
obligated
to
not
act
dishonestly
and
can
not
allow
their
interests
to
clash
with
those
of
their
principle
.
Within
the
terms
of
a
contract
a
party
is
allowed
to
include
an
express
term
to
act
or
negotiate
in
good
faith
.
This
will
mean
both
parties
will
have
to
act
and
negotiate
in
good
faith
and
the
courts
will
uphold
this
term
as
it
is
written
in
the
contract
if
it
is
breached
by
either
party
.
In
Berkeley
Community
Villages
Ltd
v
Pullen
,
it
was
held
that
an
agreement
would
be
enough
to
create
a
contractual
obligation
for
the
parties
to
act
in
good
faith
.
This
approach
was
also
used
in
CPC
Group
Ltd
v
Qatari
Diar
Real
Estate
Investment
Co
by
Vos
J.
who
stated
that
‘
the
obligation
of
utmost
good
faith
in
the
[
contract]was
to
adhere
to
the
spirit
of
the
contract
…
.
And
to
observe
reasonable
commercial
standards
of
fair
dealing
,
in
the
shortest
possible
time
,
and
to
be
faithful
to
the
agreed
common
purpose
,
and
to
act
consistently
with
the
justified
expectations
of
the
parties
.
’
There
is
an
increased
amount
of
recognition
for
express
terms
to
act
in
good
faith
in
commercial
contracts
and
many
judges
will
uphold
the
term
because
their
concern
is
ensuring
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
not
breached
.
This
means
that
if
a
party
wants
a
good
faith
obligation
in
their
contract
then
they
just
have
to
include
one
as
a
term
of
the
contract
but
if
the
other
party
does
not
want
a
goof
faith
obligation
imposed
on
them
then
it
can
cause
some
issues
for
the
parties
as
it
could
be
assumed
that
the
other
party
may
not
have
the
intention
to
act
fairly
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
do
n’t
want
a
good
faith
obligation
in
the
contract
.
However
,
if
there
was
a
good
faith
obligation
then
this
would
ensure
that
both
the
parties
have
to
act
fairly
towards
one
another
which
would
almost
eliminate
the
party
’s
having
bad
intentions
entering
the
contract
as
they
know
if
they
act
upon
their
bad
intentions
then
they
will
have
to
face
the
consequences
in
court
.
In
the
past
there
has
been
attempts
by
judges
to
introduce
a
good
faith
principle
that
extends
to
all
contracts
.
In
1766
Lord
Mansfield
declared
that
‘
[
t]he
governing
principle
is
applicable
to
all
contracts
and
dealings
.
Good
faith
forbids
either
party
by
concealing
what
he
privately
knows
,
to
draw
the
other
into
a
bargain
,
from
his
ignorance
of
that
fact
,
and
his
believing
the
contrary
.
But
either
party
may
be
innocently
silent
,
as
to
grounds
open
to
both
,
to
exercise
their
judgment
upon
.
’
However
this
outlook
did
not
last
long
as
the
courts
favoured
party
autonomy
and
sanctity
of
contract
more
.
It
is
useful
for
parties
to
have
an
express
term
to
act
in
good
faith
in
their
contract
as
it
would
allow
them
to
resolve
a
problem
that
might
happen
in
the
future
using
a
good
faith
mechanism
rather
than
use
an
expensive
third
-
party
tool
.
Having
an
express
term
to
negotiate
or
act
in
good
faith
will
allow
parties
to
plan
ahead
in
the
event
of
an
uncontrollable
event
happening
such
as
the
market
crashing
or
an
economic
recession
.
In
the
event
this
does
happen
the
parties
will
be
able
to
discuss
how
they
can
continue
to
keep
working
with
each
other
and
how
they
will
uphold
their
side
of
the
agreement
.
It
is
becoming
very
common
to
find
good
faith
clauses
within
contracts
in
the
modern
day
which
suggests
that
many
people
want
to
trade
in
good
faith
and
would
not
be
opposed
to
a
good
faith
obligation
as
a
lot
of
those
in
commercial
contracts
have
willingly
decided
to
include
a
good
faith
clause
in
their
contracts
.
Good
faith
may
sometimes
be
implied
by
law
in
certain
contracts
as
a
term
that
must
be
followed
.
It
is
often
needed
in
order
for
the
contract
to
run
smoothly
.
It
is
not
implied
based
upon
the
intentions
of
the
parties
,
rather
because
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
two
parties
.
The
different
types
of
contracts
it
can
be
implied
in
include
employment
contracts
,
contracts
of
sale
and
goodwill
as
well
as
partnerships
and
contracts
with
fiduciary
duties
.
Another
way
good
faith
can
be
implied
is
through
fact
.
This
is
done
to
give
importance
to
the
intention
of
the
parties
in
the
contract
.
It
is
often
implied
based
on
necessity
and
obviousness
.
The
case
of
Yam
Seng
Pte
v
International
Trade
Corp
Ltd
was
significant
in
discussing
whether
there
was
an
implied
obligation
that
both
parties
will
act
in
good
faith
with
each
other
.
Lord
Leggart
J.
had
agreed
that
the
terms
in
the
contract
were
enough
to
imply
good
faith
and
he
also
argued
in
favour
of
‘
the
implication
of
a
term
requiring
good
faith
in
performance
’
not
only
in
just
relational
contracts
but
most
commercial
contracts
based
on
the
expectations
of
both
parties
.
The
fact
that
English
law
already
has
many
instances
where
it
uses
pockets
of
good
faith
proves
that
a
good
faith
principle
would
prove
to
be
useful
for
parties
entering
into
a
contract
as
it
is
already
used
in
several
types
of
contracts
and
contractual
relations
.
Many
other
countries
such
as
the
United
States
of
America
,
Canada
and
Australia
have
a
good
faith
principle
in
place
which
means
that
it
is
possible
for
the
United
Kingdom
to
have
one
too
without
the
worry
of
wondering
how
they
will
execute
such
a
principle
.
Although
,
the
English
courts
might
argue
that
having
an
obligation
of
good
faith
will
take
away
from
the
party
’s
freedom
of
contract
and
party
autonomy
,
this
can
be
disputed
with
the
fact
that
the
Canadian
Supreme
Court
has
said
‘
the
principle
of
good
faith
must
be
applied
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
the
fundamental
commitments
of
the
common
law
of
contract
which
generally
places
great
weight
on
the
freedom
of
contracting
parties
to
pursue
their
individual
self
-
interest
.
’
The
English
courts
can
follow
a
similar
approach
and
apply
the
principle
in
a
way
that
will
still
allow
those
in
commercial
contracts
their
contractual
freedom
whilst
also
ensuring
that
they
deal
in
a
way
that
is
honest
,
fair
and
truthful
to
the
other
party
.
The
introduction
of
a
good
faith
obligation
will
allow
parties
to
feel
more
reassured
that
if
the
other
party
was
to
act
in
bad
faith
towards
them
,
then
they
will
at
least
have
support
from
the
courts
.
The
party
who
acted
in
bad
faith
would
be
required
to
give
compensation
to
the
other
party
in
order
to
correct
their
wrongdoings
.
The
English
courts
are
already
accepting
of
a
good
faith
clause
within
contracts
and
also
state
that
there
is
a
duty
to
act
in
good
faith
in
certain
types
of
relationships
.
This
suggests
that
they
may
be
open
to
the
idea
of
introducing
a
legally
binding
principle
of
good
faith
.
The
law
has
developed
in
regard
to
express
terms
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
since
the
case
of
Walford
v
Miles
where
the
House
of
Lords
had
stated
that
promises
to
negotiate
or
not
sell
were
unenforceable
and
rejected
that
the
opposing
party
were
under
an
obligation
to
act
in
good
faith
.
Lord
Acknew
has
stated
that
‘
a
bare
agreement
to
negotiate
was
not
enforceable
,
as
it
lacked
the
necessary
certainty
.
It
was
no
more
than
an
‘
agreement
to
agree
’
.
However
,
in
Petromec
Inc
v
Petroleo
Brasileiro
SA
Petrobras
it
was
held
that
if
there
was
an
express
term
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
then
it
is
enforceable
.
Whilst
Longmore
LJ
had
expressed
that
there
were
three
objections
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
,
he
also
stated
that
these
objections
did
not
completely
prevent
enforceability
.
He
claimed
that
the
first
objection
had
carried
little
weight
because
normally
the
express
obligation
would
have
been
enforceable
.
The
second
objection
would
be
difficult
to
determine
as
it
is
unlikely
the
courts
will
be
able
to
decide
when
the
breach
of
the
term
had
amounted
to
good
faith
and
unless
fraud
was
involved
then
it
is
likely
the
court
would
not
consider
the
other
party
had
acted
in
bad
faith
.
In
regard
to
the
third
objection
Longmore
LJ
stated
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
loss
had
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
breach
.
The
development
in
the
law
after
both
of
these
cases
suggests
that
judges
are
more
accepting
of
good
faith
clauses
and
they
are
not
seen
as
unenforceable
‘
agreements
to
agree
’
.
The
general
view
of
judges
in
recent
times
agree
with
Longmore
LJ
and
believe
it
would
be
‘
quite
wrong
’
for
the
courts
to
deem
an
express
clause
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
as
unenforceable
.
It
can
be
argued
that
introducing
a
good
faith
principle
will
undermine
party
autonomy
and
freedom
of
contract
,
but
this
can
be
easily
resolved
by
using
a
method
of
enforcement
similar
to
Canada
when
it
comes
to
good
faith
.
If
the
English
courts
enforce
good
faith
,
then
they
should
limit
the
amount
they
get
involved
in
order
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
parties
.
If
the
courts
introduce
a
good
faith
clause
then
it
should
be
‘
capable
of
being
given
legal
content
’
.
A
good
faith
obligation
would
lead
to
fair
dealing
and
less
attempts
of
people
acting
in
bad
faith
towards
others
.
It
would
allow
for
more
trust
between
parties
as
they
will
have
more
hope
that
it
is
unlikely
the
other
party
will
act
unfairly
and
unjustly
towards
them
.
In
conclusion
there
should
be
a
good
faith
principle
introduced
in
English
law
as
it
will
reassure
those
entering
commercial
contracts
that
if
they
were
to
enter
a
contract
then
the
other
party
will
have
to
act
towards
them
in
good
faith
and
trade
fairly
with
them
.
Parties
can
also
be
reassured
that
the
courts
would
help
them
if
the
other
party
acted
in
bad
faith
towards
them
.
There
is
also
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
people
in
commercial
contracts
including
clauses
to
act
or
negotiate
in
good
faith
towards
one
another
.
This
proves
that
many
people
are
going
out
of
their
way
to
include
these
clauses
as
it
can
be
seen
as
a
form
of
protection
.
Many
international
courts
have
a
good
faith
obligation
in
place
,
and
it
does
not
take
away
from
the
freedom
parties
have
,
rather
it
enhances
their
security
and
lessens
the
chances
of
them
being
scammed
.
This
is
because
the
other
party
will
less
likely
want
to
act
in
bad
faith
if
they
know
the
implications
of
their
actions
if
taken
to
court
.
Whilst
it
is
likely
the
courts
will
have
some
reservations
or
concerns
towards
a
good
faith
obligation
;
they
can
look
at
how
international
courts
implement
the
obligation
.
This
will
help
them
to
keep
a
balance
between
doing
too
much
or
too
little
whilst
maintaining
the
general
principles
of
English
commercial
law
.

Hello

sorry
I
forgot
to

this
in

previous
email

Hello
Alasdair
Hope
you
’re
well
I
wanted
to
ask
you
if
it
would
be
possible
to
ask
lecturers
if
they
could
create
a
weekly
checklist
or
having
everything
that
needs
to
be
done
for
the
week
such
as
lectures
,
seminars
,
readings
and
any
extra
videos
or
quizzes
etc
in
one
folder
labelled
with
the
week
as
it
is
would
be
a
lot
easier
for
us
to
find
and
stay
organised
.
I
know
some
lecturers
have
done
this
and
I
have
found
it
very
useful
and
easy
this
way
as
me
and
a
few
other
people
are
getting
abit
confused
with
finding
some
learning
materials
.
I
understand
if
this
is
not
possible
as
it
is
extra
work
.
Thank
you
.
Thanks
I
’ll
check
them
out
and
as
for
the
extra
support
as
of
now
I
do
n’t
think
I
’ll
need
it
but
if
I
do
I
’ll
be
sure
to
let
you
know
.
.
That
’s
great
thank
you
very
much
.
Hi
Anni
I
’m
interested
in
the
customer
service
and
retail
sectors
but
would
n’t
mind
admin
jobs
etc

I
also
would
prefer
for
it
to
be
part
time
as
I
do
have
university
on
Thursdays
,
Thursday
and
Tuesday
from
10
-
11am
.
Thank
you
for
your
help
.
hello
Cornie
if
it
is
suitable
i
would
like
to
set
up
a
meeting
with
you
either
this
weekend
or
sometime
next
week
.
If
you
are
available
then
please
let
me
know
so
we
can
arrange
a
meeting
.
Hello
Ashli
I
am
a
bit
confused
with
the
date
the
module
poster
is
due
as
on
the
actual
individual
assignment
tab
it
says
DDMMYY
but
on
the
assessment
sheet
it
says
DDMMYY
.
I
hope
you
can
clarify
this
for
me
.
Thank
you
.

Hello
No
worries
and
I
'm
free
on
Wednesday
ideally
around
2
pm
if
that
works
for
you
if
not
i
can
do
pretty
much
anytime
.
I
do
n't
have
discord
sorry
but
if
there
is
another
suitable
platform
you
can
suggest
then
I
should
be
ok
with
that
.
Hello
Jenni
Hope
you
're
well
.
I
am
emailing
to
find
out
how
getting
a
reference
from
my
tutor
works
as
I
had
forwarded
your
details
on
to
a
potential
placement
company
,
but
they
emailed
to
tell
me
you
had
said
that
there
are
no
records
of
me
and
so
you
are
unable
to
provide
a
reference
.
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
this
is
because
there
is
a
process
to
getting
a
reference
that
I
was
unaware
of
or
because
there
is
actually
no
record
of
me
in
the
system
.
Hope
to
hear
from
you
soon
.

Hello
The
lady
who
needs
the
reference
went
on
furlough
.
However
,
she
should
return
on
the

I
will
email
her
and
ask
for
it
to
be
sent
over
.
Thank

Hello
My
full
name
is
..
.
is
the
only
forename
I
use
.
This
is
really
unusual
as
I
have
never
encountered
a
problem
like
this
before
.
.
ause
it
allows
you
to
talk
about
merits
and
possible
issues
but
I
’ll
mention
them
briefly
Did
u
want
to
do
the
other
side
?
Might
mention
this
as
my
wider
research
I
’m
just
going
of
what
’s
given
bc
it
’s
basically
easy
marks
😭
Like
would
u
be
able
to
talk
about
it
as
a
theme
I
think
it
does
relate
as
a
theme
because
with
arbitration
as
there
are
different
forms
etc
and
some
more
formal
than
in
others
in
terms
of
procedure
s
parties
will
have
some
understanding
of
what
to
expect
if
they
have
the
relevant
legal
representation
to
inform
them
of
what
s
going
to
happen
.
And
the
use
of
arbitration
clauses
in
commercial
contracts
also
allows
parties
to
be
protected
to
an
extent
hink
If
u
can
argue
it
do
it
Because
it
will
look
good
I
do
n’t
know
anything
honestly
I
’m
winging
this
Is
negotiation
a
form
of
arbitration
?
I
was
abit
confuses
😭
Sorry
lol
was
on
the
phone
As
long
as
it
’s
relevant
and
u
can
link
it
you
will
be
ok
I
do
n’t
actually
remember
what
the
case
was
abt
Yeah
as
long
as
u
can
explain
the
link
you
will
be
ok
Do
u
think
we
will
need
a
case
I
have
n’t
even
got
that
far
🥺
But
check
the
lecture
I
took
a
long
tiktok
break
by
accident
I
think
it
’s
in
the
first
I
should
’ve
done
that
but
I
do
my
pass
😂
ts
very
sweet
of
you
thanks
alot
Danella
okay
thanks
Myrlene
what
were
these
for
😂

Hello
Marleen
I
am
writing
to
ask
you
a
question
in
relation
to
the
poster
topics
.
I
have
seen
the
three
topics
that
have
been
given
to
us
and
was
a
bit
confused
when
you
mentioned
topic
,
topic
etc
as
a
poster
topic
for
us
to
do
in
today
's
seminar
as
they
do
not
really
relate
to
the
topics
,
we
have
been
given
.
I
just
wanted
to
know
if
we
are
supposed
to
stick
to
those
three
topics
or
can
we
still
do
topic
,
topic
etc
.
Sorry
if
you
have
already
addressed
this
but
I
may
have
missed
it
due
to
personal
circumstances
.

Hello
Kathryne
hope
you
are
doing
well
I
have
two
images
I
wish
to
use
for
the
topic
poster
but
I
'm
unsure
whether
they
are
copyright
.
The
first
is
a
graph
from
the
gov
website
and
its
source
as
listed
on
the
cite
is
I
have
also
copied
the
image
on
to
this
email
.
If
i
can
use
this
image
i
just
want
to
know
if
i
would
use
the
same
source
or
change
it
to
the
website
.
the
second
image
i
wish
to
use
is
an
organisation
logo
.
It
says
the
image
is
copyrighted
but
can
be
used
if
one
of
the
provided
images
is
used
I
just
wanted
to
know
if
our
poster
would
come
under
a
reason
to
be
able
to
use
it
.
Hello
Paolina
Hope
you
’re
doing
well
.
I
am
emailing
to
ask
if
it
’s
possible
to
have
a
extension
on
the
coursework
as
I
’m
currently
struggling
to
keep
up
due
to
the
fact
that
I
have
a
university
assignment
due
a
day
before
the
units
are
due
.
I
understand
it
’s
not
ideal
but
I
have
completed
around
3
units
and
have
2
left
and
some
corrections
which
I
will
aim
to
do
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
hope
you
can
understand
.
Kind
regards
.
That
's
great
,
thank
you
very
much

Hello

know

supposed
to
fill
in
the
data
on
the
job
form
in
unit
four
with
our
real
data
or
with
fake
data
as
it
says
to
use
dummy
data

then
on
the
form
it
asks
us
to
confirm
whether
the
data
is
true
or
not
.

you

Executive
summary
The
following
portfolio
applies
the
six
-
sigma
principle
is
being
fulfilled
.
Background
Information
Superdrug
are
a
UK
health
and
beauty
retailer
and
the
second
largest
behind
competitor
Boots
plc
,
with
900
stores
across
the
UK
and
Ireland
and
a
few
European
countries
.
In
2016
it
became
the
UK
’s
fastest
growing
retailer
in
its
industry
,
doubling
its
profit
in
the
previous
year
.
Superdrug
have
employed
over
14,000
people
across
all
their
locations
.
In
2011
they
launched
their
loyalty
card
as
part
of
their
‘
Take
another
look
’
campaign
and
in
2015
the
card
was
re
-
branded
and
given
a
new
name
.
Presently
,
the
loyalty
card
has
seen
a
decline
in
the
past
3
years
,
with
less
customers
signing
up
our
using
their
card
.
Aims
and
Objectives
From
the
brief
we
understand
that
the
overall
aim
of
this
proposal
is
to
regain
numbers
in
your
loyalty
programme
and
make
sure
that
they
remain
consistent
or
rise
in
the
long
-
term
.
Therefore
,
the
overall
objective
,
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
decline
in
Superdrug
’s
loyalty
program
.
This
proposal
will
identify
factors
contributing
to
the
loyalty
decline
in
order
for
the
marketing
team
to
begin
working
on
plausible
solution
.
Some
key
questions
that
should
be
asked
are
:
•
Are
members
of
the
loyalty
program
currently
satisfied
with
the
program
?
•
Are
the
current
marketing
efforts
effective
?
•
Why
have
some
customers
abandoned
the
program
?
What
did
they
not
like
about
the
pro-
gram
?
Research
Design
The
study
will
consist
of
one
quantitative
and
one
qualitative
method
.
The
first
part
of
the
study
will
target
customers
that
have
left
the
loyalty
scheme
within
the
past
3
years
.
The
aim
is
to
discover
why
they
chose
to
unsubscribe
from
the
program
.
This
will
be
the
qualitative
part
of
the
study
;
a
focus
group
,
consisting
of
10
-
15
participants
,
across
the
UK
and
Ireland
.
We
recommend
that
the
participants
are
as
widespread
as
possible
to
avoid
bias
and
display
representation
.
As
Focus
groups
are
costly
,
we
thought
that
we
should
start
with
a
small
sample
to
begin
with
,
if
this
study
proves
useful
it
can
be
carried
over
to
other
European
countries
where
Superdrug
operates
.
The
quantitative
part
of
the
study
will
focus
on
current
members
of
the
program
,
highlighting
marketing
efforts
that
encouraged
them
to
join
the
programme
and
discovering
whether
they
are
currently
satisfied
with
its
offering
.
This
information
will
be
sought
via
an
online
questionnaire
.
Both
stages
of
research
will
use
an
incentive
to
encourage
participants
to
take
part
in
the
research
.
The
reason
why
we
would
like
to
approach
the
study
this
is
way
is
to
gain
an
in
-
depth
but
representative
understanding
of
the
research
problem
.
Research
Method
Qualitative
Research
It
is
unlikely
that
the
participants
would
travel
far
for
something
like
this
,
so
we
suggest
that
phone
interviews
are
conducted
.
Each
interview
would
last
approximately
10
-
15
mins
,
as
research
has
shown
that
this
is
the
average
time
that
customers
would
be
willing
to
take
part
in
this
type
of
interview
.
The
questions
will
be
a
mix
of
open
-
ended
and
closed
questions
allowing
some
quantifiable
answers
as
well
as
thoughts
and
opinions
which
are
equally
valuable
.
The
incentive
provided
could
be
a
generous
discount
of
50
%
off
all
purchases
at
Superdrug
for
the
next
6
months
.
The
data
will
be
collected
,
and
content
analysed
.
Quantitative
Research
This
is
supporting
research
to
the
phone
interviews
.
Essentially
,
we
are
looking
at
conducting
a
survey
for
all
shoppers
,
targeting
a
response
rate
of
200
participants
,
using
a
15
%
discount
as
an
incentive
to
respond
.
The
participants
will
be
gathered
from
the
mailing
list
of
beauty
card
users
in
the
UK
and
Ireland
.
The
survey
will
ask
questions
related
to
their
overall
experience
of
being
a
card
user
,
from
what
marketing
tools
encouraged
them
to
sign
up
to
if
they
would
recommend
the
service
and
an
overall
numerical
rating
of
the
service
.
The
responses
will
be
collected
and
analysed
by
a
computer
system
.
Sampling
technique
The
sample
of
Customers
are
a
mix
of
previous
and
current
program
users
.
The
aim
is
to
identify
the
similarities
between
the
groups
likes
and
dislikes
about
the
program
which
should
help
identify
the
causes
for
the
program
’s
decline
.
The
telephone
interviews
should
consist
of
female
participants
ranging
from
age
14
-
25
.
Superdrug
should
contact
participants
via
email
,
which
should
be
stored
in
their
database
.
Consider
potential
methods
for
data
analysis
The
telephone
interviews
will
be
analysed
using
thematic
coding
.
Using
the
interview
transcripts
,
the
responses
will
be
sorted
into
broad
themes
and
the
number
of
times
these
appear
will
be
recorded
in
a
tally
.
The
highest
scoring
‘
theme
’
will
be
an
indication
as
to
the
cause
.
This
can
be
correlated
with
the
answers
received
from
the
survey
.
As
for
the
survey
,
all
answers
can
be
calculated
via
a
computer
,
which
can
later
be
converted
into
bar
charts
or
other
visual
graphs
for
easy
presentation
to
management
teams
.
Ethical
conduct
In
both
cases
it
is
Important
to
get
consent
from
all
participants
.
In
particular
the
participants
of
the
telephone
interview
,
who
are
ex
-
loyalty
card
users
,
there
should
be
no
harassment
from
the
interviewer
nor
should
the
participant
be
made
to
feel
bad
for
their
decision
to
leave
the
program
.
All
participants
need
to
be
made
aware
beforehand
that
the
interview
will
be
recorded
,
allowing
them
the
opportunity
to
withdraw
if
they
choose
.
For
all
participants
taking
part
in
the
survey
,
terms
and
conditions
outlining
what
the
data
will
be
used
for
should
be
agreed
to
.
For
participants
that
are
under
the
age
of
18
,
it
should
be
made
clear
that
a
parent
needs
to
consent
to
the
terms
and
conditions
.
Morning
SIr
,
I
approached
you
this
morning
abut
the
topic
Presentation
.
I
think
I
am
unclear
about
what
we
are
being
asked
to
do
,
I
understand
that
the
task
is
about
topic
,
however
reading
through
the
case
study
and
data
I
ca
n't
seem
to
identify
an
issue
,
rather
their
topic
seemed
successful
,
so
I
am
unsure
of
what
to
change
.
Thank
you
for
your
time

variables

are
affecting
the
decline

Good
Morning
,
I
recently
began

test
,
which
I
had

completed

I
left
the
test
early
,
as
this
was
not
what
I
was
looking
for
,
I
'm
not
sure
if
this
will
affect
my
marks
in
any
way
,
but
I
was
hoping
I
could
get
this
removed
from
my
account
as
caution
.

the
same
bed
and
up

5
flatmates

I

Good
Afternoon
,
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
,
given
the
current
circumstances
.
It
seems
that
the

have
been
made
private
on
system
,
when
will
we
be
able
to
access
them
again
?

Afternoon
,
Hope
you
are
doing
well
.
I
just
wanted
to
find
out
whether
you
have
had
a
chance
to
review
my
project
outline
yet
.
I
have
n't
seen
a
mark
on
system
,
so
I
'm
not
sure
whether
it
is
acceptable
or
if
I
need
to
change
it
.
Thanks
..
Afternoon
,
Is
the
module
information
not
meant

The

I
just
want
to
make
sure
that
I
have

Abstract
:
This
report
goes
into
detail
about
a
study
which
investigated
the
type
of
personality
that
an
individual
has
whether
that
is
openness
,
conscientiousness
,
extraversion
,
agreeableness
and
neuroticism
.
The
participants
consisted
of
both
females
and
males
.
Materials
:
All
participants
were
given
a
questionnaire
sheet
to
complete
along
with
a
pen
.
The
items
used
in
the
FFQ
and
BFI
,
the
BFI
scoring
technique
can
be
found
in
the
Hartmann
and
Johns
paper
.
Procedure
:
For
this
study
firstly
informed
consent
was
taken
and
the
participants
were
aware
that
they
had
the
right
to
withdraw
at
any
time
during
the
study
.
All
participants
were
given
the
questionnaire
to
complete
within
an
hour
and
were
told
to
put
a
number
next
to
all
the
statements
in
the
questionnaire
.
They
were
asked
to
answer
as
honestly
as
they
could
and
following
this
all
of
the
questionnaires
had
their
results
taken
in
and
were
analysed
.
Results
:
From
the
table
you
are
able
to
see
that
the
figures
for
the
standardized
B
are
low
digits
.
The
correlation
is
not
significant
.
Discussion
:
From
the
table
above
you
are
able
to
see
correlation
did
not
show
a
significant
association
between
the
personality
and
health
.
It
could
be
said
that
the
predictor
values
have
a
weak
correlational
relationship
with
the
FFQ
scores
,
in
addition
to
this
the
result
also
show
that
the
personality
factors
have
negative
correlations
with
the
FFQ
score
apart
from
neuroticism
.
In
addition
to
this
,
the
descriptive
statistics
show
that
the
minimum
score
of
the
FFQ
was
1.50
and
the
maximum
score
for
the
FFQ
score
was
111.50
,
which
is
a
large
range
.
Lastly
this
caused
the
mean
to
equal
21.7
and
therefore
that
concludes
that
the
participants
overall
do
not
have
unhealthy
eating
behaviours
and
habits
.
These
results
are
what
the
predictions
stated
earlier
on
in
the
report
,
e.g.
it
was
predicted
that
the
participants
with
a
high
neuroticism
FFQ
score
will
have
a
positive
correlation
with
bad
and
unhealthy
eating
habits
and
this
could
be
due
to
the
fact
that
they
are
prone
to
bad
eating
habits
as
a
way
of
coping
with
their
stress
.
Individuals
with
the
conscientiousness
score
showed
that
it
was
a
predictor
.
In
addition
to
this
,
there
are
logical
explanations
as
to
why
the
study
proved
the
predictions
.
Firstly
,
it
could
be
because
normally
self-
report
methods
are
bias
on
behalf
of
the
participants
as
they
may
want
to
seem
and
come
across
better
than
they
actually
are
,
which
is
known
as
social
desirability
bias
.
In
this
case
,
it
would
have
been
expected
that
the
participants
were
giving
more
desirable
answers
,
and
this
led
to
"
healthier
"
individuals
.
This
also
proves
that
previous
research
is
accurate
.
Due
to
these
results
it
is
evident
that
the
correlational
study
is
reliable
and
holds
high
validity
.
I
was
wondering
how
I
would
be
able
to
change
the
email
that
I
had
used
for
system
,
and
redirect
it
to
use
this
email
instead
.
The
email
I
am
currently
using
belongs
to
my
college
therefore
I
want
to
change
it
to
this
one
?
My
reference
number
is
4714
.
Thankyou

Dear

,
I
was
wondering
whether
I
had
to
book
an
appointment
in
order
to
have
my

out
,
or
whether
I
could
just
drop
in

because
I
am
not
able
to
book

,
I
was
thinking
of

to
actually
do
my

properly

I
’m
not
sure
why
,
but
I
think
it
may
be
because
I

feels
more
overwhelming

I
am
continuing
to
do

Reasoning
has
two
explanations
which
have
differences
and
similarities
between
them
.
Firstly
,
inductive
reasoning
is
a
process
where
a
subject
has
a
specific
argument
meaning
the
argument
is
related
to
true
facts
whereas
within
an
inductively
valid
argument
the
conclusion
is
general
.
A
solution
that
is
creativity
must
be
valuable
and
useful
in
one
way
or
another
and
has
to
be
understood
and
noticed
by
society
.
There
are
four
main
perspectives
that
could
be
used
to
discover
more
about
creativity
,
which
is
based
on
studying
creative
people
,
the
creative
process
,
the
creative
product
of
the
environment
of
creativity
.
It
was
said
that
creativity
can
be
assessed
using
the
psychometric
approach
which
Guilford
in
1956
distinguished
into
two
ways
of
thinking
.
Convergent
thinking
is
when
the
individual
converges
the
correct
answer
and
the
best
answer
to
a
problem
.
Whereas
the
other
type
of
thinking
that
Guilford
suggested
was
divergent
thinking
which
is
when
the
individual
develops
many
different
solutions
to
the
same
problem
,
and
this
requires
more
flexibility
,
wider
thinking
and
originality
.
Divergent
thinking
was
considered
a
form
of
creativity
which
Guilford
attempted
to
conceptualize
,
however
an
issue
with
this
was
that
these
tests
can
often
confuse
creativity
and
intelligence
or
creativity
and
originality
therefore
it
may
be
hard
to
distinguish
.
Furthermore
,
another
way
that
creativity
can
be
assessed
is
the
biographic
and
autographic
approach
where
Wallas
in
1926
identified
four
stages
of
creative
process
.
First
being
preparation
which
is
when
background
knowledge
is
absorbed
,
also
incubation
which
is
when
the
problem
is
dismissed
for
any
reason
.
Wallas
also
said
that
inspiration
was
art
of
the
creative
process
which
is
when
the
solution
is
developed
for
the
first
time
.
Lastly
,
verification
is
part
of
the
creative
process
when
the
individual
confirms
whether
the
solution
was
successful
or
not
.
These
stages
were
proved
with
evidence
regarding
the
assessment
of
creativity
,
however
with
the
exclusion
of
incubation
.
The
incubation
period
has
still
remained
controversial
regarding
the
creativity
process
.

I
have

Hi

Hi

I

the

Thanks

The
Monty
Hall
Dilemma
discredits
the
use
of
sacrificial
dilemmas-
which
much
research
on
MR
is
founded
on
-
to
assess
the
difference
between
any
forms
of
MR
.
One
reasons
he
gives
refers
to
the
idea
that
in
some
dilemmas
,
the
option
to
sacrifice
puts
the
individual
in
a
position
where
the
decision
could
be
made
out
of
self
-
interest
.
Deontological
forms
of
MR
appear
to
be
about
an
agent
’s
intentionality
whereas
utilitarianism
refers
more
to
consequences
.
There
is
conflicting
consensus
about
whether
they
’re
two
different
systems
but
there
's
criticism
about
the
fact
that
as
theories
,
they
are
n’t
necessarily
distinctive
,
more
importantly
,
the
use
of
dilemmas
to
assess
the
forms
of
MR
are
not
beneficial
and
do
not
account
for
MR
in
the
real
world
.
Dilemmas
like
this
are
also
snapshot
instances
and
its
very
questionable
as
to
whether
these
theories
can
describe
MR
outside
said
dilemmas
.

at

the

only
0.1

or
there
is
also
Victoria

,
which
is
around
0.2
miles
away
.
The
national
Museum
of
Finland
is
good
choice
,
they
have
an
exhibition
called
'
the
Story
of
Finland
'
and
you
an

a
private

Or
there
is
also
an

the
'

which
has
pieces

from
the

up

there

both
serve
the

For

to
do
in

,
there
is
Tavastia

plays
live

or
there
is
also
Navy

if
looking

for

there
is
a

in

called
Annensoppi

My

book
an

how
it
all

anything

Hi
Barbey
,
I
've
attached
all
the
documents
I
think
need
to
be
sent
as
drafts
,
I
put
the
questions
inside
the
research
protocol
rather
than
sending
two
different
documents
and
again
,
highlighted
questionable
things
in
red
for
all
documents
and
out
of
those
that
did
that
,
81
%
showed
significant
results
?
And
then
the
next
group
tried
to
replicate
the
pre
-
registered
study
,
and
90
%
was
significant
?
I
hope
that
makes
sense

nosey

Autism
spectrum
disorder
which
suggests
that
AI
have
better
recall
when
they
are
provided
with
more
support
on
what
they
want
to
remember
.
However
,
autism
is
a
spectrum
disorder
,
indicating
that
individuals
can
be
extremely
diverse
,
much
research
into
autism
even
shows
the
difference
as
majority
of
it
looks
in
to
high
-
functioning
AI
.
Even
so
,
the
studies
allow
for
base
recommendations
that
can
improve
with
more
research
.
The
last
recommendation
of
using
technology
to
better
conduct
interviews
also
requires
more
research
in
the
field
but
can
no
doubt
offer
a
more
suitable
approach
for
AW
that
struggle
with
the
social
component
of
interviews
.

Hi
Brooke
,
Hope
you
’re
doing
well
,
now
that
the
exams
are
over
and
terms
started
back
up
again
I
was
wondering
when
would
be
the
best
time
to
go
over
some
transcriptions
and
start
to
analyse
them
?
I
do
n’t
completely
understand
how
to
start
and
I
feel
like
it
’d
be
quite
a
long
appointment
so
I
did
n’t
know
where
to
book
it
on
system
or
email
you
for
better
times
?
Please
let
me
know
what
you
think
is
best
!
Thank
you

Hi
Esmeralda
,
I
’m
not
sure
if
you
’ve
seen
my
earlier
email
yet
but
I
’m
guessing
it
’s
too
late
in
the
week
to
make
that
decision
now
,
so
if
there
’s
no
time
you
prefer
for
a
particularly
long
meeting
,
I
’ll
just
book
for
an
hour
on
system
as
early
as
possible
next
week
.
Thanks

Hello
,
I
'm
emailing
to
enquire
whether
I
can
book
an
appointment
for
this
coming
week
?
I
have
a
couple
of
essays
coming
up
and
with
my
final
year
project
too
,
I
think
I
need
some
direction
in
my
academic
writing
skills
.
Many
thanks

Erika

Thank
you
for
the
flexibility
but
I
have
my
last
seminar
exactly
2
-
4
on
the
Sunday
so
I
wo
n’t
be
able
to
book
an
appointment
!
It
is
n’t
necessarily
urgent
and
I
do
n’t
want
to
inconvenience
you
so
any
other
time
you
’re
free
would
be
helpful
so
I
think
it
’d
be
helpful
to
go
through
the
documents
earlier
this
week
!
Thank
you

Thank
you

Yeah
that
’s
what
I
was
thinking
too
as
I
transcribe
the
other
two
I
’ll
get
a
feel
of
whether
I
need
more
.
I
’ll
be
sure
to
drop
you
an
email
when
I
’ve
finished
my
exams
and
am
ready
for
a
longer

Hi
Dunstan
,
Hope
you
had
lovely
holidays
!
I
just
wanted
to
update
you
,
I
’ve
done
4
of
my
friend
interviews
now
,
aside
from
one
50
minute
one
,
the
rest
are
between
1
-
1.5hrs
,
so
I
do
n’t
know
whether
that
means
we
should
keep
going
or
try
to
do
the
analysis
first
.
But
that
being
said
,
I
’ve
put
my
study
up
on
system
anyway
but
no
one
has
signed
up
!
If
they
do
n’t
it
’s
fine
I
can
still
send
my
advert
to
friends
I
guess
but
I
just
wanted
to
ask
what
to
do
from
here
.
Drop
me
an
email
to
let
me
know
or
if
anything
and
if
not
,
I
'll
see
you
tomorrow
at
12
!

wishes

Hi
,
Unfortunately
it
is
n’t
possible
to
do
so
any
longer
,
I
appreciate
the
honesty
but
do
n’t
require
your
participation
any
more
.
I
will
have
to
proceed
and
deduct
the
credits
from
you
though
.
