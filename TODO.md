# TODO
This file contains ideas for future additions/improvements
------

## Additions:
- Add discourse type evaluation for PAN
- syntax feats: counts of certain dependency labels, finite verb subject ommision, type of rel clause, 
- morph: embedded finite vs non-finite clauses (I hope that I can leave tomorrow vs I hope to leave tomorrow)
- prosody: do people have a stress (melodic) preference?
- NEED TO LOOK AT NORMALIZING AGAIN
- emojis: look for ASCII emojis

## Ideas
- `NEW EVAL PLAN`:
    - Regarding making the document pairs, I should just create them from my already existing train, dev, test splits instead of using the raw data. Why? Because of the information injection actually.

    - Because the texts in my splits are modified (from the injection), itâ€™ll actually be more involved to check if the document in the RAW data is in train, dev or test. The strings won't be the same because of the modification.


## When changing data sets, the following need to be altered manually:
- POS bigrams & mixed bigrams in `featurizers.py` vocabulary paths need to be set to new pickle file


## Code rework next steps
- debug feaurizers.py
- KNN:
    - make result file output better
