## Code improvements:
- Make `featurizers.py` call `generate_non_static_vocab` on the fly

## When changing data sets, the following need to be altered manually:
- get_dataset_name function has to be updated with a new dataset name conditional
- After generating vocabulary via `generate_non_static_vocab.py`, POS bigrams & mixed bigrams in `featurizers.py` vocabulary paths need to be manually set to new pickle file generated for the new dataset
