# TODO
This file contains ideas for future additions/improvements
------

## Additions:

- add syntactic stuff
- Ablation studies
- syntax feats: counts of certain dependency labels, finite verb subject ommision, type of rel clause, 
- morph: embedded finite vs non-finite clauses (I hope that I can leave tomorrow vs I hope to leave tomorrow)
- prosody: do people have a stress (melodic) preference?

## Ideas
- k-NN: if no majority vote, switch k value??
- KNN vs NN (1 vector/document VS 1 vector/author k=1)
